Horizon intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this statement for purposes of invoking those safe-harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements can include statements about estimated cost savings, plans and objectives for future operations and expectations about Horizons financial and business performance as well as economic and market conditions. They often can be identified by the use of words such as expect, may, could, will, intend, project, estimate, believe, anticipate, seek, plan and variations of such words and similar expressions. Horizon may include forward-looking statements in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), such as this Form 10-K, in other written materials, and in oral statements made by senior management to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. It is intended that these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and Horizon undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the forward-looking statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. By their nature, forward-looking statements are based on assumptions, which although believed to be reasonable, and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, such as the following:  economic conditions and their impact on Horizon and its customers;  changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity;  estimates of fair value of certain of Horizons assets and liabilities;  volatility and disruption in financial markets;  prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values, collateral securing loans and other assets;  sources of liquidity;  potential risk of environmental liability related to lending activities;  changes in the competitive environment in Horizons market areas and among other financial service providers;  legislation and/or regulation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and Horizon and its subsidiaries in particular, including the effects resulting from the reforms enacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) and the adoption of regulations by regulatory bodies under the Dodd-Frank Act;  changes in regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements;  changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be adopted and required by regulatory agencies;  rapid technological developments and changes;  containing costs and expenses;  the slowing or failure of economic recovery;  the ability of the U.S. federal government to manage federal debt limits; and  the risks of expansion through mergers and acquisitions, including unexpected credit quality problems with acquired loans, difficulty integrating acquired operations and material differences in the actual financial results of such transactions compared with Horizons initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings. You are cautioned that actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. The Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K lists some of the factors that could cause Horizons actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Your attention is directed to this discussion. 3 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) Other risks and uncertainties that could affect Horizons future performance are set forth below in Item 1A - Risk Factors. PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS The disclosures in this Item 1 are qualified by the disclosures below in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, and in other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. General Horizon Bancorp (Horizon or the Company) is a registered bank holding company incorporated in Indiana and headquartered in Michigan City, Indiana. Horizon provides a broad range of banking services in Northwestern and Central Indiana and Southwestern Michigan through its bank subsidiary, Horizon Bank, N.A. (the Bank) and other affiliated entities. Horizon operates as a single segment, which is commercial banking. Horizons common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol HBNC. The Bank was chartered as a national banking association in 1873 and has operated continuously since that time. The Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering commercial and retail banking services, corporate and individual trust and agency services and other services incident to banking. On July 17, 2012, Horizon completed its acquisition of Heartland Bancshares, Inc. (Heartland) and Heartlands wholly owned subsidiary, Heartland Community Bank (Heartland Bank). Heartland was merged into Horizon, and Heartland Bank was merged into the Bank. The exchange ratio was 0.81 shares of Horizons common stock for each share of Heartland common stock outstanding. Horizon acquired the 1,442,449 outstanding shares of Heartland common stock in exchange for 1,168,383 shares of Horizon common stock, which had a market price of $16.83 per share at the close of business on July 17, 2012. Horizon also purchased and retired all shares of preferred stock that Heartland had issued pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (TARP). Based upon the $16.83 market price and the TARP preferred stock purchase, the total value of the consideration for the acquisition was $26.9 million. As a result of the acquisition, the Company experienced, and expects to continue to experience, increases in its deposit base and reductions in transaction costs. The Company also expects to reduce cost through economies of scale. On June 1, 2010, the Company announced the completion of the purchase of assets and the assumption of liabilities of American Trust & Savings Bank (American) in Whiting, Indiana. The transaction was consummated on May 28, 2010. The Company purchased most of the banking-related assets of American, totaling $107.8 million and assumed all the deposits, federal home loan bank advances, trust preferred securities, and accrued interest payable in the approximate amount of $110.3 million. The Company paid a deposit premium on core deposits of approximately $2.1 million and $500,000 in additional consideration. As a result of the acquisition, the Company experienced, and expects to continue to experience, increases in its deposit base and reductions in transaction costs. The Company also expects to reduce cost through economies of scale. The Bank maintains 29 full service offices. At December 31, 2012, the Bank had total assets of $1.85 billion and total deposits of $1.29 billion. The Bank has three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Horizon Investments, Inc. (Horizon Investments), Horizon Insurance Services, Inc. (Horizon Insurance) and Horizon Grantor Trust. Horizon Investments manages the investment portfolio of the Bank. Horizon Insurance offered a full line of personal and corporate insurance products until March 2005, at which time the majority of its assets were sold to a third party. Horizon Insurance is no longer an operating subsidiary and is primarily used to collect residual insurance income. Horizon Grantor Trust holds title to certain company owned life insurance policies. Horizon formed Horizon Bancorp Capital Trust II in 2004 (Trust II) and Horizon Bancorp Capital Trust III in 2006 (Trust III) for the purpose of participating in pooled trust preferred securities offerings. The Company assumed additional debentures as the result of the acquisition of Alliance Financial Corporation in 2005, which formed Alliance Financial Statutory Trust I (Alliance Trust). The Company also assumed additional debentures as the result of the 4 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) American transaction, which formed Am Tru Statutory Trust I (Am Tru Trust). The Company also assumed additional debentures as the result of the Heartland transaction, which formed Heartland (IN) Statutory Trust II (Heartland Trust). See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding these previously consolidated entities that are now reported separately. The business of Horizon is not seasonal to any material degree. No material part of Horizons business is dependent upon a single or small group of customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have a materially adverse effect on the business of Horizon. In 2012, revenues from loans accounted for 59.8% of the total consolidated revenue, and revenues from investment securities accounted for 12.8% of total consolidated revenue. Available Information The Companys Internet address is www.accesshorizon.com. The Company makes available, free of charge through the Investor RelationsSEC Filings section of its Internet website, copies of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Employees The Bank employed approximately 419 full and part-time employees as of December 31, 2012. Horizon, Horizon Insurance and Horizon Grantor Trust do not have any employees. Competition Horizon faces a high degree of competition in all of its primary markets. The Banks primary market consists of Porter, LaPorte, St. Joseph, Elkhart, Lake, Marion and Johnson Counties Indiana, and Berrien and Kalamazoo Counties Michigan. The Bank competes with other commercial banks as well as with savings and loan associations, consumer finance companies and credit unions. To a more moderate extent, the Bank competes with Chicago money center banks, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, brokerage houses, other institutions engaged in money market financial services and certain government agencies. Based on deposits as of June 30, 2012, Horizon was the largest of the 10 bank and thrift institutions in LaPorte County with a 33.28% market share and the sixth largest of the 15 institutions in Porter County with a 9.31% market share. In Berrien County, Michigan, Horizon was the fourth largest of the 10 bank and thrift institutions with a 7.45% market share. Horizons market share of deposits in Lake County, Indiana was just over 1% at 1.43%, and less than 1% in each of St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties in Indiana and Kalamazoo County in Michigan. The branches of Horizon Bank acquired in the merger with Heartland Bank, which operate under the Heartland Community Bank a Horizon Bank Company name, are located throughout Johnson County Indiana and have a 13.29% market share, giving Horizon the largest share of the 19 bank and thrift institutions in the Johnson County market. (Source: FDIC Summary of Deposits Market Share Reports, available at www.fdic.gov). Regulation and Supervision As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board or FRB) as its primary federal regulator. The Bank, as a nationally chartered bank, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as its primary federal regulator and, as to certain matters, by the FRB and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Both federal and state law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business, such as reserve requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations. Branching by the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction and requires notice to, or the prior approval of, the OCC. The Dodd-Frank Act permits the establishment of de novo branches in states where such branches could be opened by a state bank chartered by that state. The consent of the state is no longer required. 5 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) The Bank Holding Company Act Horizon is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act). Federal Reserve Board policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and management strength for their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, codified this policy. Under this requirement, Horizon is required to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances in which Horizon might not otherwise do so. For this purpose, source of financial strength means Horizons ability to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of the Banks financial distress. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire more than a 5% voting interest of any bank or bank holding company. Additionally, the BHC Act restricts Horizons non-banking activities to those which are determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking and a proper incident thereto. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the FDICIA), a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become undercapitalized (as defined in FDICIA) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency. Bank holding companies are required to comply with the Federal Reserves risk-based capital guidelines. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) also have risk-based capital ratio guidelines to which depository institutions under their respective supervision are subject. The guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations. Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. For Horizons regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2012, see the information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in Item 7 below, which is incorporated herein by reference. National Bank Act As a national bank, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act. The Bank is supervised, regulated, and examined by the OCC, and is subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC, Federal Reserve, and the FDIC. Deposit Insurance and Assessments The Banks deposits are insured to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Banks are subject to deposit insurance premiums and assessments to maintain the DIF. A banks deposit insurance premium assessment rate depends on the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned. The FDIC has authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured banks in order to achieve statutorily required reserve ratios in the DIF and to impose special additional assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in significant changes to the FDICs deposit insurance system. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund at no less than 1.35%, and must achieve the 1.35% designated reserve ratio by September 30, 2020. The FDIC must offset the effect of the increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on insured depository institutions of less than $10 billion and may declare dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar quarter is at least 1.5%, although the FDIC has the authority to suspend or limit such permitted dividend declarations. In December 2010, the FDIC adopted a final rule setting the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at 2% of estimated insured deposits. Also as a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act, the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums was changed, effective April 1, 2011, from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Tangible equity for this purpose means Tier 1 capital. Effective April 1, 2011, the initial base assessment rates were as follows:  For small Risk Category I banks, such as Horizon, the rates range from 5-9 basis points.  The rates for small institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV are 14, 23 and 35 basis points, respectively.  For large institutions and large, highly complex institutions, the rate schedule ranges from 5 to 35 basis points. 6 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) Adjustments are made to the initial assessment rates based on long-term unsecured debt, depository institution debt, and brokered deposits. Horizons FDIC deposit insurance expense decreased during 2012 compared to 2011 as the new assessment calculation resulted in lower expense for the Bank. In addition, the Bank used $3.7 million of the $6.0 million of the premiums prepaid on December 30, 2009 to offset the assessment paid. The FDIC is continuing to offset the regular insurance assessments until the earlier of the exhaustion of an institutions prepaid assessments or June 30, 2013. Any prepaid assessment remaining after collection of the amount due on June 30, 2013, will be returned to the institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also extended unlimited insurance on noninterest bearing accounts for no additional charges through December 31, 2012. Under this program, traditional noninterest demand deposit (or checking) accounts that allowed for an unlimited number of transfers and withdrawals at any time, whether held for a business, individual, or other type of depositor, were covered. Later, Congress added Lawyers Trust Accounts (IOLTA) to this unlimited insurance protection through December 31, 2012. On December 31, 2012, as scheduled, the unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts provided under the Dodd-Frank Act expired. Deposits held in noninterest-bearing transaction account are now aggregated with any interest-bearing deposits the owner may hold in the same ownership category, and the combined total is insured up to at least $250,000. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by, or written agreement with, the FDIC. The FDIC may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. FDIC-insured institutions are also subject to the requirement to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (FICO), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds are repaid between 2017 and 2019. The FICO assessment rate was 0.66 basis points for each $100 of insured deposits for each quarter of 2012. For the first quarter of 2013, the FICO assessment rate is 0.64 basis points for each $100 in domestic deposits maintained at an institution. Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders Horizon and the Bank are subject to the Federal Reserve Act, which restricts financial transactions between banks, affiliated companies and their executive officers, including limits on credit transactions between these parties. The statute prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a banks extension of credit to an affiliate. Effective July 21, 2011, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the exceptions under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act for transactions with financial subsidiaries and expanded the scope of transactions treated as covered transactions to include derivatives transactions and securities repurchase agreements. The Dodd-Frank Act also expands the types of transactions subject to insider lending limits. Capital Regulation The federal bank regulatory authorities have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies that are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and account for off-balance sheet items. Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories of 0%, 20%, 50%, or 100%, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. The capital guidelines divide a bank holding companys or banks capital into two tiers. The first tier (Tier I) includes common equity, certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships, subject to certain limitations). Supplementary capital (Tier II) includes, among other items, cumulative perpetual and long-term limited-life preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, certain hybrid capital instruments, term subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations, less required deductions. 7 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) Banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, of which 4% must be Tier I capital. The federal banking regulators may, however, set higher capital requirements when a banks particular circumstances warrant. Banks experiencing or anticipating significant growth are expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels. Also required by the regulations is the maintenance of a leverage ratio designed to supplement the risk-based capital guidelines. This ratio is computed by dividing Tier I capital, net of all intangibles, by the quarterly average of total assets. The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for the most highly rated institutions, and 1% to 2% higher for institutions not meeting those standards. Pursuant to the regulations, banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk, including the volume and severity of problem loans to which they are exposed. In June 2012, the federal banking agencies issued notices of proposed rulemakings that revise each agencys risk-based and leverage capital requirements consistent with agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel III), including implementation of a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement and a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement. The agencies also proposed, consistent with Basel III, to apply limits on a banking organizations capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified buffer of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The proposed rulemaking also would revise the agencies prompt corrective action framework by incorporating the new regulatory capital minimums and updating the definition of tangible common equity. Such proposed capital requirements were originally proposed to be phased in beginning on January 1, 2013 for all depository institution holding companies; however, in late 2012, the agencies issued guidance indicating that they did not expect the regulatory capital rules to actually become effective on such date due to the volume of comments received and the wide range of views expressed during the comment period. Basel III specified that banks should be compliant with the new capital requirements by January 2, 2015, but on January 6, 2013, the restrictions were eased to provide for annual increases that would result in full compliance in 2019. Since final rules have not been issued by the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC, the Basel III framework does not yet apply to Horizon and the Bank and, therefore, it is difficult to predict the potential impact of the Basel III changes. On November 10, 2010, Horizon repurchased from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) 6,250 shares, or 25%, of the 25,000 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock), that Horizon had issued to the Treasury in December 2008 in connection with Horizons participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program. On August 25, 2011, Horizon issued 12,500 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the Series B Preferred Stock), for proceeds of $12.5 million and used those proceeds, together with otherwise available funds, to redeem the remaining 18,750 of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the Treasury. The following is a summary of Horizons and the Banks regulatory capital and capital requirements at December 31, 2012. Actual For Capital1Adequacy Purposes For Well1Capitalized Purposes Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio As of December 31, 2012 Total capital1 (to risk-weighted assets) Consolidated $ 178,638 13.72 % $ 104,162 8.00 % N/A N/A Bank 161,557 12.42 % 104,062 8.00 % $ 130,078 10.00 % Tier 1 capital1 (to risk-weighted assets) Consolidated 162,354 12.47 % 52,078 4.00 % N/A N/A Bank 145,273 11.17 % 52,023 4.00 % 78,034 6.00 % Tier 1 capital1 (to average assets) Consolidated 162,354 9.17 % 70,820 4.00 % N/A N/A Bank 145,273 8.22 % 70,692 4.00 % 88,366 5.00 % 1 As defined by regulatory agencies 8 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Federal Reserve to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository subsidiaries, except that bank holding companies with less than $500 million in assets are exempt from these capital requirements. Dividends Dividends received from the Bank are the primary source of Horizons revenues. The Banks payment of dividends, without prior regulatory approval, is subject to regulatory limitations. Under the National Bank Act, the Bank, as a national bank, is required to obtain the prior approval of the OCC for the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by it in one year would exceed its net profits for the current year plus its retained net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus. In addition, the Bank may only pay dividends to the extent that its retained net profits (including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed the banks undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the banks allowance for loan losses. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Bank is prohibited from paying any dividends, making other distributions or paying any management fees if, after such payment, it would fail to satisfy its minimum capital requirements. During the period that the Series A Preferred Stock issued to the Treasury was outstanding, Horizons ability to declare, pay or increase dividends on its shares of common stock was further restricted. These restrictions terminated on August 25, 2011, when Horizon completed the redemption of all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. However, the issuance to the Treasury of the Series B Preferred Stock resulted in the imposition of new limitations on Horizons ability to pay dividends. Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, no repurchases may be effected, and no dividends may be declared or paid on preferred shares ranking pari passu with the Series B Preferred Stock, junior preferred shares, or other junior securities, including the common stock, during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, except that, in any such quarter in which the dividend is paid, dividend payments on shares ranking pari passu may be paid to the extent necessary to avoid any resulting material covenant breach. Horizon does not anticipate that these restrictions will affect its ability to pay the required dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock or its ability to continue to pay dividends on its common stock. Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad powers to require the bank to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators powers depends on whether the institution in question is well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators corrective powers include: (i) requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan; (ii) placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; (iv) restricting transactions with affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. At December 31, 2012, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized, meaning that the Banks total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10%, the Banks Tier I risk-based capital ratio exceeded 6%, the Banks leverage ratio exceeded 5%, and the Bank was not subject to a regulatory order, agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act Horizon is subject to the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires financial institutions to implement additional policies and procedures with respect to, or additional measures designed to address, any or all of the following matters, among others: money laundering, suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting, and currency crimes. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Horizon also is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), which revised the laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies to all companies with equity or debt securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act established: (i) new requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise and responsibilities; (ii) additional 9 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) new standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers; and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violation of the securities laws. Management expects that significant additional efforts and expense will continue to be required to comply with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Pursuant to the final rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission to implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Horizon is required to include in each Form 10-K it files a report of management on Horizons internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report must include a statement of managements responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate control over financial reporting of Horizon, identify the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of Horizons internal control over financial reporting and provide managements assessment of the effectiveness of Horizons internal control over financial reporting. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes an attestation report issued by Horizons registered public accounting firm on Horizons internal control over financial reporting. For fiscal years prior to the year ended December 31, 2012, Horizon was not an accelerated filer and, therefore, Horizon was exempt from the attestation report requirements. Significant efforts have been required to comply with Section 404, and Horizon anticipates additional efforts will be required in future years. Recent Legislative Developments On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which significantly changes the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that profoundly affect how community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies are regulated in the future. Among other things, these provisions have resulted in the abolishment of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the transfer on its functions to the other federal banking agencies, relaxed rules regarding interstate branching, allowed financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, changed the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage and imposed new capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve, which has the authority to promulgate consumer protection regulations applicable to all entities offering consumer financial services or products, including banks. Effective July 21, 2011, the CFPB assumed primary responsibility for administering substantially all of the consumer compliance regulations formerly administered by other federal agencies. The CFPB also has the authority to promulgate consumer protection regulations that will apply to all entities, including banks, that offer consumer financial services or products. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act includes a series of provisions covering mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards and pre-payments. The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, many of which may have an impact on the operating environment of Horizon in substantial and unpredictable ways. The ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and Horizon in particular, remains uncertain. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to future rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on Horizon and the financial services industry more generally. Horizons management continues to review rules and regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and assess their probable impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations of Horizon. Other Regulation In addition to the matters discussed above, the Bank is subject to additional regulation of its activities, including a variety of consumer protection regulations affecting its lending, deposit, and collection activities and regulations affecting secondary mortgage market activities. Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies The Banks earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserves monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have major effects upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. 10 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) Federal Home Loan Bank System The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Indianapolis, which is one of twelve regional FHLBs. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLB is funded primarily from funds deposited by banks and savings associations and proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. All FHLB advances must be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. The Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), an independent agency, controls the FHLB System, including the FHLB of Indianapolis. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Indianapolis in an amount equal to at least 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts, or similar obligations at the beginning of each year. At December 31, 2012, the Banks investment in stock of the FHLB of Indianapolis was $11.0 million. The FHLB imposes various limitations on advances such as limiting the amount of certain types of real estate related collateral to 30% of a members capital and limiting total advances to a member. Interest rates charged for advances vary depending upon maturity, the cost of funds to the FHLB of Indianapolis and the purpose of the borrowing. The FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings associations and to contribute to affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income housing projects. For the year ended December 31, 2012, dividends paid by the FHLB of Indianapolis to the Bank totaled approximately $331,000, for an annualized rate of 3.14%. Limitations on Rates Paid for Deposits FDIC regulations place limitations on the interest rates that less than well-capitalized insured depository institutions may pay on deposits. Under these regulations, well capitalized depository institutions may accept, renew or roll such deposits over without restriction, adequately capitalized depository institutions may accept, renew or roll such deposits over with a waiver from the FDIC (subject to certain restrictions on payments of rates) and undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept, renew or roll such deposits over. The regulations contemplate that the definitions of well capitalized, adequately capitalized and undercapitalized will be the same as the definition adopted by the agencies to implement the corrective action provisions of federal law. Management does not believe that these regulations will have a materially adverse effect on the Banks current operations. Legislative Initiatives Additional legislative and administrative actions affecting the banking industry may be considered by the United States Congress, state legislatures and various regulatory agencies, including those referred to above. It cannot be predicted with certainty whether such legislative or administrative action will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry in general or Horizon and its affiliates will be affected.

From time to time, the Bank obtains information, which may lead management to believe that the collection of payments may be doubtful on a particular loan. In recognition of such, it is managements policy to convert the loan from an earning asset to a non-accruing loan. Further, it is managements policy to place a commercial loan on a non-accrual status when delinquent in excess of 90 days or have had the accrual of interest discontinued by management. The officer responsible for the loan, the Chief Operating Officer and the senior collection officer must review all loans placed on non-accrual status. 14 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) 2. Potential Problem Loans: Impaired and non-accrual loans for which the discounted cash flows or collateral value exceeded the carrying value of the loan totaled $23.8 million and $20.1 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The allowance for impaired and non-accrual loans, included in the Banks allowance for loan losses totaled $5.5 million and $4.6 million at those respective dates. The average balance of impaired loans during 2012 and 2011 was $6.1 million and $4.8 million. 3. Foreign Outstandings: None 4. Loan Concentrations: As of December 31, 2012, there are no significant concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans. See Item III A above for a listing of the types of loans by concentration. D. Other Interest-Bearing Assets There are no other interest-bearing assets as of December 31, 2012, which would be required to be disclosed under Item III C.1 or 2 if such assets were loans. IV.

RISK FACTORS An investment in Horizons securities is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes currently affect Horizon are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks as well as information we include or incorporate by reference in this report and other filings we make with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business operations. If any of these risks or uncertainties materializes or any of these assumptions proves incorrect, our results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements in this report are current only as of the date on which the statements were made. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which any statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Risks Related to Our Business As a financial institution, we are subject to a number of risks relating to our daily business. Although we undertake a variety of efforts to manage and control those risks, many of the risks are outside of our control. Among the risks we face are the following:  Credit risk: the risk that loan customers or other parties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations;  Market risk: the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation;  Liquidity risk: the risk that Horizon or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet its operating needs;  Operational risk: the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events;  Economic risk: the risk that the economy in our markets could decline further resulting in increased unemployment, decreased real estate values and increased loan charge-offs; and  Compliance risk: the risk of additional action by our regulators or additional regulation could hinder our ability to do business profitably. The current economic environment poses significant challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain world, national and local conditions in our markets. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption since 2008. This presents financial institutions with unprecedented circumstances and challenges that in some cases have resulted in large declines in the fair values of investments and other assets, constraints on liquidity and significant credit quality problems, including severe volatility in the valuation of real estate and other collateral supporting loans. Our financial statements have been prepared using values and information currently available to us, but given this volatility, the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements could change rapidly, resulting in material future adjustments in asset values and the allowance for loan losses, which could negatively impact our ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth such as we began experiencing in the latter half of 2008 and which continued through 2011. Financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets. While we continue to take steps to decrease and limit our exposure to residential construction and land development loans and home equity loans, we nonetheless retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets, and we are affected by these events. Continued declines in real estate values, home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment, including job loss, could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the national economic recession or further deterioration in local economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following other consequences: increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets 17 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) and foreclosures; demand for our products and services may decline; deposits may decrease, which would adversely impact our liquidity position; and collateral for our loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans. Our financial performance may be adversely impacted if we are unable to continue to grow our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, obtain low-cost funds and compete with other providers of financial services. Our ability to maintain our history of record earnings year after year will depend, in large part, on our ability to continue to grow our loan portfolios and obtain low-cost funds. For the past seven years, we focused on increasing consumer loans, and we intend to continue to emphasize and grow consumer, as well as commercial loans in the foreseeable future. This represented a shift in our emphasis from prior years when we focused on mortgage banking services, which generated a large portion of our income during those years. We have also funded our growth with low-cost consumer deposits, and our ability to sustain our growth will depend in part on our continued success in attracting and retaining such deposits or finding other sources of low-cost funds. Another factor in maintaining our history of record earnings will be our ability to expand our scope of available financial services to our customers in an increasingly competitive environment. In addition to other banks, our competitors include credit unions, securities brokers and dealers, mortgage brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, and finance and insurance companies. Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with our competitors. Competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and banking reform. The recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense. All federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, since July 21, 2011, financial institutions can offer interest on demand deposits to compete for customers. We are offering interest on demand deposits, but we do not expect this change to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our commercial and consumer loans expose us to increased credit risks. We have a large percentage of commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans generally have greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful business operations of the borrowers. These loans also typically have much larger loan balances than residential mortgage loans. Consumer loans generally involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans because they are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate in value. Although we undertake a variety of underwriting, monitoring and reserving protections with respect to these types of loans, there can be no guarantee that we will not suffer unexpected losses, and recently, we have experienced an increase in the default rates in our consumer loan portfolio, particularly relating to indirect auto loans. Our holdings of construction, land and home equity loans may pose more credit risk than other types of mortgage loans. In light of current economic conditions, construction loans, loans secured by commercial real estate and home equity loans are considered more risky than other types of mortgage loans. Due to the disruptions in credit and housing markets, real estate values have decreased in most areas of the U.S., and many of the developers to whom we lend experienced a decline in sales of new homes from their projects. As a result of this market disruption, some of our land and construction loans have become non-performing as developers are unable to build and sell homes in volumes large enough for orderly repayment of loans and as other owners of such real estate (including homeowners) were unable to keep up with their payments. We believe we have established adequate reserves on our financial statements to cover the credit risk of these loan portfolios. However, there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed our reserves, and ultimately result in a material level of charge-offs, which could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and capital. 18 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) The allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and non-performing assets. There is no certainty that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Changes in market interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our profitability depends on our ability to manage our assets and liabilities during periods of changing market interest rates. If rates increase rapidly as a result of an improving economy, we may have to increase the rates paid on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than loans and investments re-price, resulting in a negative impact on interest spreads and net interest income. The impact of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds from savings accounts to higher rate certificate of deposit accounts. Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be negatively affected, as competitive pressures could keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, and prepayments and curtailments on assets may continue. Such movements may cause a decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest margin, and therefore, decrease our profitability. Changes in interest rates also could affect loan volume. For instance, an increase in interest rates could cause a decrease in the demand for mortgage loans (and other loans), which could result in a significant decline in our revenue stream. We also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities. A continued economic slowdown in Northwestern Indiana and Southwestern Michigan could affect our business. Our primary market area for deposits and loans consists of LaPorte and Porter Counties in Northwestern Indiana and Berrien County in Southwestern Michigan. During 2012, unemployment rates remained at elevated levels in our primary market area, resulting in continued high levels of consumer delinquencies and bankruptcy filings. The continued economic slowdown could hurt our business. The possible consequences of such a continued downturn could include the following:  increases in loan delinquencies and foreclosures;  declines in the value of real estate and other collateral for loans;  an increase in loans charged off;  an increase in the Companys expense to fund loan loss reserves;  an increase in collection costs;  a decline in the demand for our products and services;  an increase in non-accrual loans and other real estate owned. 19 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) The loss of key members of our senior management team could affect our ability to operate effectively. We depend heavily on the services of our existing senior management team, particularly our CEO Craig M. Dwight, to carry out our business and investment strategies. As we continue to grow and expand our business and our locations, products and services, we will increasingly need to rely on Mr. Dwights experience, judgment and expertise as well as that of the other members of our senior management team and will also need to continue to attract and retain qualified banking personnel at all levels. Competition for such personnel is intense in our geographic market areas. If we are unable to attract and retain talented people, our business could suffer. The loss of the services of any senior management personnel, particularly Mr. Dwight, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund acquisitions and to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments, regulatory capital requirements and business needs, particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Although we are currently, and have historically been, well capitalized for regulatory purposes, our capital levels are not far in excess of the well capitalized threshold, and in the past we have been required to maintain increased levels of capital in connection with certain acquisitions. Additionally, we periodically explore acquisition opportunities with other financial institutions, some of which are in distressed financial condition. Any future acquisition, particularly the acquisition of a significantly troubled institution or an institution of comparable size to us, may require us to raise additional capital in order to obtain regulatory approval and/or to remain well capitalized. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. We cannot guaranty that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, our depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Moreover, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations and may restrict our ability to grow. Potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value. We periodically evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. We generally seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:  Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company,  Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company,  Potential disruption to our business,  Potential diversion of our managements time and attention away from day-to-day operations, 20 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data)  The possible loss of key employees, business and customers of the target company,  Difficulty in estimating the value of the target company, and  Potential problems in integrating the target companys systems, customers and employees with ours. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving the payment of cash or the issuance of our debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. To the extent we were to issue additional common shares in any such transaction, our current shareholders would be diluted and such an issuance may have the effect of decreasing our stock price, perhaps significantly. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. One of our most critical estimates is the level of the allowance for loan losses. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will not have to increase the allowance for loan losses and/or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance. Our mortgage warehouse and indirect lending operations are subject to a higher fraud risk than our other lending operations. We buy loans originated by mortgage bankers and automobile dealers. Because we must rely on the mortgage bankers and automobile dealers in making and documenting these loans, there is an increased risk of fraud to us on the part of the third-party originators and the underlying borrowers. In order to guard against this increased risk, we perform investigations on the mortgage companies with whom we do business, and we review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance. However, there is no guarantee that our procedures will detect all cases of fraud or legal noncompliance. Our mortgage lending profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to resell mortgages or experience other problems with the secondary market process or are unable to retain our mortgage loan sales force due to regulatory changes. Currently, we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate. The profitability of our mortgage banking operations depends in large part upon our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and to sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, we are dependent upon the existence of an active secondary market and our ability to profitably sell loans into that market. Our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae (the Agencies) and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including the Agencies, are government-sponsored enterprises whose activities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of such government-sponsored enterprises could, in turn, adversely affect our operations. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. Although to date, the conservatorship has not had a significant or adverse effect on our operations, and during 2010 and 2011 the Federal Housing Administration Agency indicated that the Treasury Department is committed to fund Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to levels needed in order to sufficiently meet their funding needs; it is currently unclear whether further 21 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) changes would significantly and adversely affect our operations. In addition, our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by the Agencies and other institutional and non-institutional investors. Our ability to remain eligible may also depend on having an acceptable peer-relative delinquency ratio for Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and maintaining a delinquency rate with respect to Ginnie Mae pools that are below Ginnie Mae guidelines. In the case of Ginnie Mae pools, we have repurchased delinquent loans from them in the past to maintain compliance with the minimum required delinquency ratios. Although these loans are typically insured as to principal by the FHA, such repurchases increase our capital and liquidity needs, and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital or liquidity to continue to purchase such loans out of the Ginnie Mae pools if required to do so. Any significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the Agencies could materially and adversely affect our operations. Further, the criteria for loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time-to-time by the sponsoring entity which could result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations. The profitability of participating in specific programs may vary depending on a number of factors, including our administrative costs of originating and purchasing qualifying loans and our costs of meeting such criteria. The banking industrys methodology for paying its mortgage loan sales force is currently under regulatory scrutiny and dependent upon the outcome may materially change the manner in how the sales force is paid. This change in compensation may make it difficult for banks to retain their sales force, which in turn may affect future retail mortgage volume. We are exposed to intangible asset risk in that our goodwill may become impaired. As of December 31, 2012, we had $23.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, or slower growth rates could result in further impairment of goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, then we would record the appropriate charge, which could be materially adverse to our operating results and financial position. For further discussion, see Notes 1 and 10, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. We are subject to extensive regulation and changes in laws and regulatory policies could adversely affect our business. Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal agencies. See Supervision and Regulation in the description of our Business in Item 1 of Part I of this report for detailed information on the laws and regulations to which we are subject. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulator policies can materially affect our business. The likelihood of any major changes in the future and their effects are impossible to determine. As an example, the Bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or by regulatory or bankruptcy court action that reduces the amount the Banks borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts. Also, the Bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits its ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible. Legislation enacted in recent years, together with additional actions announced by the U.S. Treasury and other regulatory agencies, continue to develop. It is not clear at this time what impact the Dodd-Frank Act, other recent legislation and liquidity and funding initiatives of the U.S. Treasury and other bank regulatory agencies, and additional programs that may be initiated in the future will have on the financial markets and the financial services industry. The extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced could continue to effect the U.S. banking industry and the broader U.S. and global economies, which will have an effect on all financial institutions, including Horizon. 22 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) Our inability to continue to accurately process large volumes of transactions could adversely impact our business and financial results. In the normal course of business, we process large volumes of transactions. If systems of internal control should fail to work as expected, if systems are used in an unauthorized manner, or if employees subvert the system of internal controls, significant losses could result. We process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside Horizon, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that are designed to provide us with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures also exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur, including the consequences of operational errors. While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processing systems and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur. Our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately or timely addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We continually encounter technological changes. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. Third-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure, including Internet connections, network access and transaction and other processing services. Although we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of inadequate or interrupted service, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third- party vendors also could result in significant delay and expense. 23 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) Damage to our reputation could damage our business. Our business depends upon earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation our reputation. Adverse publicity about Horizon, whether or not true, may result in harm to our prospects. Should any events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm would not adversely affect our earnings and results of operations. The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings. The Standard & Poors downgrade in the U.S. governments sovereign credit rating, and in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by certain related institutions, agencies and instrumentalities, could result in risks to Horizon and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poors downgraded the United States long-term debt rating from its AAA rating to AA+. On August 8, 2011, Standard & Poors downgraded the credit ratings of certain long-term debt instruments issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other U.S. government agencies linked to long-term U.S. debt. Instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, including the Bank. These downgrades could adversely affect the market value of such instruments, and could adversely impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available. We cannot predict if, when or how these changes to the credit ratings will affect economic conditions. These ratings downgrades could result in a significant adverse impact to Horizon and could exacerbate the other risks to which Horizon is subject. A world crisis could affect the U.S. economy and liquidity markets for community banks. Current worldwide events may lead to further erosion in the U.S. economy and limit community banks access to the liquidity markets. These events include possible regional conflicts that may interrupt the supply of energy products; European contagion that may affect the liquidity markets and increasing dependence upon Asian investors which may affect the bond markets and long-term interest rates. Risks Related to our Common Stock The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock at times or at prices you find attractive. Although our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, our stock price constantly changes, and we expect our stock price to continue to fluctuate in the future. Our stock price is impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. 24 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) These factors include:  variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;  operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;  increase in loan losses, non-performing loans and other real estate owned;  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance;  announcements of new products, strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;  the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;  currently on the Russell 3000 index and could come off the index;  actual or anticipated sales of our equity or equity-related securities;  our past and future dividend practice;  our creditworthiness;  interest rates;  the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing;  developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and  economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory, congressional or judicial events that affect us or the financial markets. In addition the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies and particularly those in the financial services and banking sector, including for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price, notwithstanding our operating results. Because our stock is thinly traded, it may be more difficult for you to sell your shares or buy additional shares when you desire to do so and the price may be volatile. Although our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ stock market since December 2001, our common stock is thinly traded. The prices of thinly traded stocks, such as ours, are typically more volatile than stocks traded in a large, active public market and can be more easily impacted by sales or purchases of large blocks of stock. Thinly traded stocks are also less liquid, and because of the low volume of trades, you may be unable to sell your shares when you desire to do so. Our participation in the Small Business Lending Fund program restricts our ability to pay dividends and to repurchase our securities and could have other negative effects. On August 25, 2011, we sold 12,500 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (Series B Preferred Stock), to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the Small Business Lending Fund program, a $30 billion fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that encourages lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than $10 billion. The terms of the Series B Preferred Stock impose limits on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock. Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, no repurchases may be effected, and no dividends may be declared or paid on preferred shares ranking pari passu with the Series B Preferred Stock, junior preferred shares, or other junior securities (including our common stock) during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, except that, in any such quarter in which the dividend is paid, dividend payments on shares ranking pari passu may be paid to the extent necessary to avoid any resulting material covenant breach. In addition, we may declare and pay a dividend on our common stock or other stock ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock, or repurchase shares of any such class or series of stock, only if, after payment of such dividend, the dollar amount of the Companys Tier 1 Capital would be at least 90% of the Signing Date Tier 1 Capital, which was $118,724,000, excluding any subsequent net charge-offs and any redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock. Horizon does not anticipate that these restrictions will affect its ability to pay dividends on its common stock; however, given the possibility of unforeseen developments or events, there can be no guarantee that Horizon will be able to pay dividends on its common stock. 25 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) Provisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws, and Indiana law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us by a third party. Our articles of incorporation and by-laws and Indiana law contain provisions that have certain anti-takeover effects. While the purpose of these provisions is to strengthen the negotiating position of the board in the event of a hostile takeover attempt, the overall effects of these provisions may be to render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a larger block of our shares, and the removal of incumbent directors and key management. Our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board, which means that only one-third of our board can be replaced by shareholders at any annual meeting. Our articles also provide that our directors may only be removed without cause by shareholders owning 70% or more of our outstanding common stock. Furthermore, our articles provide that only our board of directors, and not our shareholders, may adopt, alter, amend and repeal our by-laws. Our articles also preempt Indiana law with respect to business combinations with a person who acquires 10% or more of our common stock and provide that such transactions are subject to independent and super-majority shareholder approval requirements unless certain pricing and board pre-approval requirements are satisfied. Our by-laws do not permit cumulative voting of shareholders in the election of directors, allowing the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares to control the election of all our directors, and our directors are elected by plurality (not majority) voting. Our by-laws also establish detailed procedures that shareholders must follow if they desire to nominate directors for election or otherwise present issues for consideration at a shareholders meeting. We also have a mandatory retirement age for directors. These and other provisions of our governing documents and Indiana law are intended to provide the board of directors with the negotiating leverage to achieve a more favorable outcome for our shareholders in the event of an offer for the company. However, there is no assurance that these same anti-takeover provisions could not have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of our shareholders. Risks Related to the Series B Preferred Stock The Series B Preferred Stock is equity and is subordinate to all of our existing and future indebtedness; regulatory and contractual restrictions may limit or prevent us from paying dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock; and the Series B Preferred Stock places no limitations on the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur in the future. Shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are equity interests in Horizon and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the Series B Preferred Stock, like our common stock, ranks junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims against Horizon with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against Horizon, including in a liquidation of Horizon. Additionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarily be payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred stock like the Series B Preferred Stock, dividends are payable only when, as and if authorized and declared by, our Board of Directors and depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, debt service requirements, other cash needs and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. The current terms of the Series B Preferred Stock require dividends to be paid in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. Horizon is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank, our principal subsidiary, and derives a significant portion of its revenue in the form of dividends from the Bank. Accordingly, Horizon is and will be dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay the principal of, and interest on, its indebtedness, to satisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock. Horizons ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements while maintaining its required capital. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Horizon, Horizon may not be able to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, the Series B Preferred Stock does not limit the amount of debt or other obligations we or our subsidiaries may incur in the future. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial amounts of additional debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series B Preferred Stock or to which the Series B Preferred Stock will be structurally subordinated. 26 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) An active trading market for the Series B Preferred Stock does not currently exist and is unlikely to develop. The Series B Preferred Stock is not currently listed on any national securities exchange, and we do not intend to list the Series B Preferred Stock on a national securities exchange unless we are requested to do so by the U.S. Treasury. Even if requested to so do by the U.S. Treasury, it is not certain that such a listing can be achieved given the current exchange listing requirements, and even if listing is achieved, it is unlikely that an active trading market for the Series B Preferred Stock will develop, or, if developed, that an active trading market will be maintained. If an active trading market does not develop, the market value and liquidity of the Series B Preferred Stock may be adversely affected. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are non-cumulative. Dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are non-cumulative. If our Board of Directors does not authorize and declare a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock for any dividend period, such unpaid dividend will not accrue and will not be payable to holders of the Series B Preferred Stock even if dividends are declared for any subsequent dividend period. However, a failure to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will restrict our ability to pay dividends with respect to and repurchase shares of other classes and series of stock. Initially the dividend rate on the Series Preferred Stock will fluctuate based on our level of Qualified Small Business Lending as compared to our Small Business Lending Baseline. The per annum dividend rate on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock applicable to the first quarter is 5%. For the second through tenth quarters, the rate will be adjusted quarterly to reflect the percent of change in our Qualified Small Business Lending from our Small Business Lending baseline and may fluctuate between 1% and 5% per annum. The dividend rate will be a fixed rate for the eleventh quarter through the date that is four-and-a-half years from the issuance date of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and will be based on the rate in effect for the tenth quarter. Depending on the percentage increase in our Qualified Small Business Lending over our Small Business Lending baseline, the fixed rate will be between 1% and 5% per annum. If there has been no increase (or a decrease) in our Qualified Small Business Lending over our Small Business Lending baseline, the fixed rate will be 7% per annum. For all quarters subsequent to the four-and-one-half year anniversary of issuance, the rate will be 9% per annum. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have limited voting rights. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock only have the right to vote as a separate class on certain matters relating to the rights of holders of Series B Preferred Stock and on certain corporate transactions. Except with respect to such matters, the Series B Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. The matters on which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock would have the right to vote include amendments to Horizons Articles of Incorporation adversely affecting the Series B Preferred Stock or certain fundamental transactions affecting the Series B Preferred Stock, and in connection with the authorization of stock senior to the Series B Preferred Stock. If Horizon misses five dividend payments on the Series B Preferred Stock, whether or not consecutive, the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock will have the right, but not the obligation, to appoint a representative as an observer who will attend all meetings of Horizons Board of Directors, but such observer will not have the right to vote. 27 Table of Contents HORIZON BANCORP (Table dollars in thousands except per share data) ITEM 1B.
