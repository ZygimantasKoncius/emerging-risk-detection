RISK FACTORS RELATING TO ECONOMIES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE Economic developments in Mexico, the United States and Europe affect our business. The year 2009 was characterized by a continuation of the slowdown in global economic activity and a global recession that led to tight credit markets and to a global decline in demand. The global economic deceleration had its roots in the U.S. economy, which experienced growth decline from 2.1% in 2007 to 0.4% in 2008 and contracted at a rate of 2.4% in 2009. During the global economic crisis, the United States and other countries around the world, and particularly Spains construction market, experienced deteriorating economic conditions. Global consumer confidence eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values, inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses and sovereign nations. The housing and construction markets in the United States have been seriously affected by the sub-prime mortgage crisis, which has also affected the economy overall. The growth in housing sales and construction financed by credit played a large role in the economys expansion by lifting other sectors of the economy. Losses on subprime mortgages have negatively affected not only the housing and construction markets but other sectors and the availability of credit generally. Increased foreclosures could generate increased inventory on the housing market which could affect our residential and commercial construction sales. See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsOperating ResultsTrend Information. As a consequence of the global economic and financial crisis, and the severe recession, that began in the second half of 2008, the Mexican economy entered into a recession. In 2009, Mexicos GDP registered a contraction rate of 6.5%. In 2008, Mexicos GDP registered a growth rate of 1.3%, a lower figure than the GDP growth rate of 3.3% reported for 2007. The majority of our manufacturing facilities are located in Mexico. Therefore, our consolidated net sales resulting from sales to parties located in Mexico were 42%, 44%, and 46%, for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Thus, the current recession in Mexico could affect our operations to the extent that we are unable to reduce our costs and expenses in response to falling demand. These factors could result in a decrease in our sales and revenues. Even though the economy has shown moderate signs of recovery in 2010, some of our markets are still experiencing contraction and excess capacity, including the construction sector in the United States and Spain. In Mexico, for 2010, we expect the country to continue confronting difficulties, due to a slower than expected recovery in the domestic market and in the U.S. economy. Future economic decline in or affecting Mexico, the United States or Europe could adversely affect us and our ability to obtain financing. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have an adverse effect on our operating income and our total comprehensive financial result Our total comprehensive financing result is impacted by changes in the value of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange gains or losses included in our total financing cost result primarily from the impact of changes in the U.S. dollar-Mexican peso exchange rate on our Mexican subsidiaries U.S. dollar-denominated monetary liabilities (such as U.S. dollar-denominated debt and accounts payable arising from imports of raw materials and equipment) and assets (such as U.S. dollar-denominated cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable). Because historically our U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities have exceeded our U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets, the devaluation and appreciation of the Mexican peso resulted in exchange losses and gains, respectively. The closing exchange rate of 2009, Ps. 13.0587 per one dollar, compared with the closing exchange rate of 2008, Ps. 13.8325 per one dollar, showed an appreciation of the Mexican peso of 5.6%. This appreciation reflected an exchange gain in our financial statement. As of September 30, 2010 the exchange rate is Ps. 12.5011 per one dollar, an appreciation of 4.27% compared with the closing exchange rate of Ps. 13.0587 in December 31, 2009. Accordingly, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, the appreciation of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar resulted in foreign currency exchange gains. See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects Operating ResultsInflation and Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations. 19 Table of Contents Changes in the value of the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar also have an effect on our results of operations. In general, a devaluation of the Mexican peso results in an increase of our operating margins, and an appreciation of the Mexican peso results in a decrease in our operating margins, in each case, when measured in pesos. This is because the aggregate amount of our consolidated net sales denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar exceeds the aggregate amount of our costs of goods sold and our general, administrative and selling expenses denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar. A substantial portion of the sales generated by our Mexican subsidiaries and U.S. subsidiaries are either denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar. The prices of a significant number of the products we sell in Mexico, particularly flat glass for automotive uses and capital goods, are linked to the U.S. dollar. In addition, substantially all of our export sales are invoiced in U.S. dollars and subsequently translated into Mexican pesos using the exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction. Further, a strong Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar makes the Mexican market more attractive for importers and competitors that might not otherwise sell in the Mexican market. A strong Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar also makes our products with prices denominated in or affected by the value of the U.S. dollar less competitive or profitable. With respect to such products, when the Mexican peso appreciates we must either increase our prices in U.S. dollars, which makes our products less price-competitive, or bear reduced operating margins when measured in pesos. Given the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate, we have chosen to reduce our operating margins for such products in response to appreciation of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar in the past. The sales generated by our Spanish subsidiary are either denominated in or linked to the euro, while its cost of goods sold is denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar to the euro may have an adverse effect on us in a similar fashion to those described with respect to the value of the Mexican peso above. We may be adversely affected by increases in natural gas prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rate changes that we are unable to mitigate through derivative transactions due to our financial condition Some of our components of our costs of goods sold are subject to market price variations, especially energy costs which represented approximately 10% of our consolidated cost of goods sold in 2009. Such cost is directly linked to the price of natural gas which has experienced significant volatility in recent years. Since the price of natural gas in Mexico is tied to the price of natural gas in Southern Texas, which in turn is fully exposed to market factors such as demand in the United States or the amount of available natural gas reserves, we are exposed to such price variations. Interest rate risk exists primarily with respect to our floating-rate Mexican peso and U.S. dollar-denominated debt, which generally bear interest based on the TIIE or LIBOR. If the TIIE or LIBOR increase significantly, our ability to service our debt will be adversely affected. As of September 30, 2010, our TIIE-rate and LIBOR-rate debt amounted to Ps. 1,548 million ($124 million) and Ps. 486 million ($39 million), respectively. Because our net sales and a significant portion of our operations are denominated in the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar, our business is subject to adverse effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These fluctuations may result from changes in economic conditions, investor sentiment, monetary and fiscal policies, the liquidity of global markets, international and regional political events, and acts of war or terrorism. In addition, the fluctuation of the foreign exchange rate may adversely affect our U.S. dollar-denominated debt. We have historically entered into swaps and other DFIs in the ordinary course of our business to hedge our exposure to natural gas price increases, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. As of September 30, 2010, however, the only hedging arrangements to which we remain subject consist of hedging contracts with Pemex for approximately 32% of our estimated consumption for the remainder of the year and approximately 19% of our estimated consumption for 2011. Because of our financial condition, we are currently unable to enter into hedging transactions to further minimize our exposure to increases in natural gas prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates, and were we able to enter into such transactions, we could not assure you they would be on favorable terms. 20 Table of Contents Developments in other emerging market countries may adversely affect our business or the market price of our securities As is the case with respect to securities of issuers from other emerging markets, the market value of securities of Mexican companies is, to varying degrees, affected by economic and market conditions in other emerging market countries. Although economic conditions in these countries may differ significantly from economic conditions in Mexico, investors reactions to developments in any of these other countries may have an adverse effect on the market value of securities of Mexican issuers. In recent years, for example, prices of both Mexican debt securities and Mexican equity securities dropped substantially as a result of developments in Russia, Asia and Brazil. During recent years, Venezuela, Colombia and certain EU markets have shown instability related to certain political and economic troubles (e.g., sovereign debt problems in Greece, Spain and Portugal). In the countries in which we operate, we are subject to government protectionist measures, anti-dumping regulation, actions aimed at imposing controls on capital and other such practices that may adversely affect our business. In addition, the correlation between economic conditions in Mexico and the United States has sharpened as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and increased economic activity between the two countries. As a result of the slowing economy in the United States and the uncertainty it could have on the general economic conditions in Mexico and the United States, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, due to recent developments in the international credit markets, capital availability and cost could be significantly affected and could restrict our ability to obtain financing or refinance our existing indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all. If foreign currency exchange controls and other restrictions are imposed, we may not be able to service our debt in U.S. dollars, which exposes investors to foreign currency exchange risk In the past, the Mexican economy has experienced balance of payments deficits, shortages in foreign currency reserves and other problems that have affected the availability of foreign currencies in Mexico. The Mexican government does not currently restrict or regulate the ability of persons or entities to convert pesos into U.S. dollars. However, it has done so in the past and could do so again in the future. We cannot assure you that the Mexican government or any other government in countries in which we operate will not institute a restrictive currency exchange control policy in the future. Such restrictive foreign currency exchange control policies could prevent or restrict access to U.S. dollars and limit our ability to service our U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Political events in Mexico could affect Mexican economic policy and adversely affect us Our business, financial condition and/or results of operations may be affected by economic, political or social developments in Mexico, including, among other things, any political or social instability, changes in the rate of economic growth or contraction, changes in the exchange rate between the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar, an increase in Mexican inflation or interest rates, changes in Mexican taxation and any amendments to existing Mexican laws and regulations. Federal Congressional mid-term elections were held on July 5, 2009, and the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI) won a relative majority of the seats in the Mexican Congress, while the National Action Party (Partido Acción Nacional) lost its majority position. The PRI congressional majority, as well as its de-facto coalition with Mexicos Green Party (Partido Verde Ecologista de Mexico) and the possible lack of alignment between the President and this new legislature may result in government gridlock. We cannot provide any assurance that the current political situation or any future political developments in Mexico will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Security issues and social instability in Mexico could adversely affect us High incidences of crime throughout Mexico, including kidnappings and drug trafficking, could have an adverse effect on our business as foreign investors may be less likely to invest in Mexico, which could negatively impact our domestic economy. Social instability in Mexico or adverse social or political developments in or affecting Mexico could adversely affect us and our ability to obtain financing. The possibility of having similar or other incidents in the future could adversely affect our business and operations. 21 Table of Contents We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks In April 2009, an outbreak of AH1N1 virus occurred in Mexico and the United States followed by cases in Asia and Europe. A future occurrence of AH1N1 virus or other adverse public health developments in Mexico, or in the countries where we operate, may have a material adverse effect on our business operations. Our operations may be impacted by a number of health-related factors, including, among other things, quarantines or closures of our facilities that could disrupt our operations, and a general slowdown in the Mexican economy. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our financial statements may not give you the same information as financial statements prepared under United States accounting principles or Exchange Act reporting requirements Mexican companies listed on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, which we refer to as the Mexican Stock Exchange, including us, must prepare their financial statements in accordance with MFRS. MFRS differs in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP as it relates to our consolidated financial statements, including, among other things, the treatment of minority interests, workers profit sharing, accounting for the effects of deferred income taxes and consolidation of subsidiaries. For these and other reasons, the presentation of financial statements and reported earnings prepared in accordance with MFRS may differ materially from the presentation of financial statements and reported earnings prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and Exchange Act reporting requirements. See Note 25 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a description of the principal differences between MFRS and U.S. GAAP. Moreover, we filed a Form 15F for deregistration to terminate our registration and reporting requirements under the Exchange Act; if such deregistration is successfully completed, we will no longer be required to disclose financial and other information that is compliant with Exchange Act reporting requirements. Our operations may be adversely affected by earthquakes, hurricanes or some other natural disaster that could have an effect on our service to clients In April 2010, our float glass facility in Mexicali and the inventories in that plant sustained damage as the result of an earthquake, which caused a temporary halt in production and the loss of a large amount of inventories. On July 1, 2010, our manufacturing facilities in the Municipality of García in Nuevo León, Mexico were affected as a result of the severe flooding and damage caused by Hurricane Alex. Our float glass manufacturing and automotive processing facilities and our facilities at Álcali suffered significant damage and were forced to temporarily suspend operations. See Item 3. Key Information  Recent Developments  Temporary Suspension of Operations at Manufacturing Facilities in García, Nuevo León. Our operations may be impacted in the future by a number of natural disasters or their consequences, including, among other things, flood, damage to roads, highways and/or bridges, and interruption of water, electricity and natural gas supply, which could disrupt our operations and impact our service to our clients. 22 Table of Contents EXCHANGE RATES The following table sets forth, for each year in the six year period ended December 31, 2010, the high, low, average and annual period-end Noon Buying Rates, all expressed in pesos per U.S. dollar.

(3) Through December 31, 2007, the gain from monetary position reflected the result of holding monetary assets and liabilities during periods of inflation. Values stated in current monetary units decreased in purchasing power over time. This means that losses were incurred by holding monetary assets over time, whereas gains were realized by maintaining monetary liabilities. Beginning January 1, 2008, we stopped recognizing gains in monetary position as well as inflation effects. See Presentation of Certain Information for more information on changes in NIF B-10 regarding effects of inflation.

(ii) The Vitro Club holds land and facilities for our employees recreational activities, which are held in a trust (the Trust). The Trust can only be assigned if all of the participants name one entity as the sole beneficiary. In 2005, all the participants named the Company as the sole beneficiary, and therefore the Company has the right to take control of the Trust. The Company recorded the fair value of the assets and recognized other income of Ps. 458 million. At the end of 2008, we decided to temporarily suspend the services provided at the Vitro Club facilities. In April 2010, as part of the cost reduction plan, we sold the land and facilities of Vitro Club. (5) On June 16, 2006, we completed the sale of our 51% equity ownership interest in Vitrocrisa to Libbey, the owner of the remaining 49% equity interest. All financial and operating information relating to Vitrocrisa in this annual report, which was previously presented as one of our reportable segments is now presented as a discontinued operation. In addition, the discussion of our indebtedness in this annual report does not include the indebtedness of Vitrocrisa, which is presented under MFRS in our consolidated balance sheets as a part of Total liabilities of discontinued operations. (6) Millions of shares. (7) Calculated using year-end INPC of the most recent year divided by the year-end INPC of the previous year. (8) Based on the Free Exchange Rate at the end of the period. (9) Calculated using the average of Free Exchange Rates on the last day of each month during the period. 26 Table of Contents (10) Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Bulletin C-10, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires that all derivative instruments be recognized at fair value, sets the rules to recognize hedging activities and requires separation, if practical, of embedded derivative instruments. Through December 31, 2004, according to prior accounting standards (Bulletin C-2, Financial Instruments), the Company did not recognize the effect of hedging derivatives under financial expenses until the flow exchanges were executed. (11) From 2005 to 2006, certain of our subsidiaries were classified as discontinued operations in our U.S. GAAP consolidated financial information as they meet the definition of held for sale for U.S. GAAP purposes. These subsidiaries did not meet the definition of discontinued operations for MFRS purposes as they do not constitute the sale of a significant portion of our business. (12) The total shares held in the Stock Option Trust as of April 29, 2009, were 39.8 million. See Item 16E. Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuers and Affiliated Purchasers. (13) As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, we were in default under the indentures governing the Old Notes for $300 million, $216 million and $700 million and certain other debt; therefore, Ps. 16,689 million and Ps. 15,771 million were reclassified as short-term debt.
