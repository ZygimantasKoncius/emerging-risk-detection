D. RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks, among others. If we do not successfully address the risks to which we are subject, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our share price may decline. We cannot assure you that we will successfully address any of these risks. Pg. 3 Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry We have a history of net losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. Although in 2010 we generated net income, in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred losses of $2.6 million, $5.8 million, and $8.6 million, respectively. We may not be profitable in the future, which could materially affect our cash and liquidity and could adversely affect the value and market price of our shares. A slowdown in the telecommunications industry generally, or in the sectors of the industry that we target (currently primarily 3G and 3.5G cellular and triple-play networks), could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Our future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the telecommunications industry. The global telecommunications industry is evolving rapidly, and it is difficult to predict its potential growth rate or future trends in technology development. The deregulation, privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that have resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services may not continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies. In addition, the growth in demand for Internet and data services and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced telecommunications equipment may not continue at its current rate or at all. Our future success depends upon the increased utilization of our monitoring solutions by next-generation network operators and telecommunications equipment vendors. Industry-wide network equipment and infrastructure development driving the demand for our products and services may be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors, including cost, regulatory obstacles or the lack of, or reduction in, consumer demand for advanced telecommunications products and services. Telecommunications equipment vendors and network operators may not develop new technology or enhance current technology. Further, any such new technology or enhancements may not lead to greater demand for our products. Developments in the communications industry, such as the impact of general global economic conditions, industry consolidation, emergence of new competitors, commoditization of voice services and changes in the regulatory environment, at times have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our existing and/or potential customers. In the past, these conditions reduced the high growth rates that the communications industry had previously experienced, and caused the market value, financial results and prospects and capital spending levels of many communications companies to decline. During previous economic downturns, the telecommunications industry experienced significant financial pressures that caused many in the industry to cut expenses and limit investment in capital intensive projects and, in some cases, led to restructurings and bankruptcies. Although we are unable to determine what the full effects of the recent economic downturn will be, it may lead to significant adverse consequences for our customers and our business. During adverse conditions in the business environment for telecommunications companies, service providers often need to control operating expenses and capital investment budgets, which can affect our business. For example, the recent business climate for communication companies resulted in slowed customer buying decisions and price pressures that increased pressure on our ability to generate revenue. During 2009, and to a lesser extent during 2010, these adverse market conditions had a negative impact on our business by decreasing new customer engagements and the size of initial spending commitments under those engagements, as well as by decreasing the level of discretionary spending under contracts with existing customers. In addition, the slowdown in the buying decisions of service providers has extended our sales cycle period and limited our ability to forecast our flow of new contracts. Furthermore, during 2008 and 2009, we were affected by a slowdown in the pace of new 3G and 3.5G cellular deployments. In addition, weakness in the end-user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us. This would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenues on future sales to these customers. Any of these events would likely harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in our key markets deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Pg. 4 Recent and future economic conditions, including turmoil in the financial and credit markets, may adversely affect our business. The recent economic and credit environment has had a significant negative impact on business around the world. The impact of these conditions on the technology industry and our major customers has been quite severe. Conditions may continue to be depressed or may be subject to further deterioration which could lead to a further reduction in consumer and customer spending overall, which could have an adverse impact on sales of our products. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. In addition, any disruption in the ability of customers to access liquidity could lead customers to request longer payment terms from us or long-term financing of their purchases from us. If we are unable to grant extended payment terms when requested by customers, our sales could decrease. Granting extended payment terms or a significant adverse change in a customer’s financial and/or credit position would have an immediate negative effect on our cash balance, and could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or could limit our ability to collect receivables related to purchases by that customer. As a result, we may have to defer recognition of revenues, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase and our losses may increase. Our projected cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations. If our cash flow does not meet or exceed our current projections, then our ability to pay our obligations could be materially impaired. We believe that our existing capital resources and cash flows from operations will be adequate to satisfy our expected liquidity requirements to meet our operating obligations as they come due at least through the next twelve months. However if our actual sales and spending differ materially from our projections, we may be required to, raise capital, borrow funds or reduce discretionary spending in order to provide the required liquidity. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows or that future capital raising or borrowings will be available to us in amounts and on terms sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Our ability to continue as a going concern is substantially dependent on the successful execution of our sales and spending projections. As noted above, although in 2010 we generated net income, in previous years we generated significant losses attributable to our operations. We have managed our liquidity during this time through a series of cost reduction initiatives, expansion of our sales into new markets, private placement transactions and a venture capital loan. While we believe that our existing capital resources and cash flows from operations will be adequate to satisfy our expected liquidity requirements at least through the next twelve months, there is no assurance that, if required, we will be able to raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide the required liquidity in order to continue as a going concern. Pg. 5 We have a history of quarterly fluctuations and unpredictability in our results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue. This may cause our share price to fluctuate and/or to decline. We have experienced and expect to experience in the future significant fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include: · the variation in size and timing of individual purchases by our customers; · the absence of long-term customer purchase contracts; · seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers, such as the varying fiscal year-ends of customers and the reduction in business during the summer months, particularly in Europe; · the relatively long sales cycles for our products; · competitive conditions in our markets; · the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us and by our customers, competitors and suppliers; · changes in the level of operating expenses relative to revenues; · product quality problems; · supply interruptions; · changes in global or regional economic conditions or in the telecommunications industry; · delays in or cancellation of projects by customers; · changes in the mix of products sold; · the size and timing of approval of grants from the Government of Israel; and · foreign currency exchange rates. We believe, therefore, that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as a reliable indication of future performance. Our revenues in any period generally have been, and may continue to be, derived from a relatively small number of orders with relatively high average revenues per order. Therefore, the loss of any order or a delay in closing a transaction could have a more significant impact on our quarterly revenues and results of operations than on those of companies with relatively high volumes of sales or low revenues per order. Our products generally are shipped within 15 to 30 days after orders are received. As a result, we generally do not have a significant backlog of orders, and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked, shipped and installed in that quarter. Although we had a substantial backlog of orders at the end of 2010, there is no assurance that this will continue to be the situation in future quarters. Pg. 6 We may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenues for a number of reasons and based on revenue recognition accounting requirements. Unfulfilled orders at the beginning of each quarter are typically substantially less than our expected revenues for that quarter. Therefore, we depend on obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives. Moreover, demand for our products may fluctuate as a result of seasonality. Our revenues for a particular period may also be difficult to predict and may be adversely affected if we experience a non-linear (back-end loaded) sales pattern during the period. We generally experience significantly higher levels of sales towards the end of a period as a result of customers submitting their orders late in the period. Such non-linearity in shipments can increase costs, as irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods when overtime expenses may be incurred, and also lead to additional costs associated with inventory planning and management. Furthermore, orders received towards the end of the period may not ship within the period due to our manufacturing lead times. Except for our cost of revenues, most of our costs, including personnel and facilities costs, are relatively fixed at levels based on anticipated revenue. As a result, a decline in revenue from even a limited number of orders could result in our failure to achieve expected revenue in any quarter, and unanticipated variations in the timing of realization of revenue could cause significant variations in our quarterly operating results and could result in losses. If our revenues in any quarter remain level or decline in comparison to any prior quarter, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we do not reduce our expenses in a timely manner in response to level or declining revenues, our financial results for that quarter could be materially adversely affected. During 2010 the relative portion of medium-to-large sized deals increased. As a result, payment terms became longer and our right to collect payment became subject to certain conditions, extending the time that elapsed between the date of an initial sale and full revenue recognition. Due to the factors described above, as well as other unanticipated factors, in future quarters our results of operations could fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our ordinary shares may fall. We expect our gross margins to vary over time and our recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable or improved, which may have a material adverse effect on our future profitability. Our recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable or improved and may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including: · increased price competition; · for direct sales we may incur local sales taxes; · increased industry consolidation among our customers, which may lead to decreased demand for and downward pricing pressure on our products; · changes in customer, geographic, or product mix; · our ability to reduce and control production costs; Pg. 7 · increases in material or labor costs; · excess inventory and inventory holding costs; · obsolescence charges; · reductions in cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand; · changes in distribution channels; · losses on customer contracts; and · increased warranty costs. Our failure to sustain or improve our recent level of gross margins, due to these or other factors, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The market for our products is characterized by changing technology, requirements, standards and products, and we may be materially adversely affected if we do not respond promptly and effectively to such changes. The telecommunications market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing customer requirements, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, certain changes of which could reduce the market for our products or require us to develop new products. For example, the new LTE (Long Term Evolution) network required us to develop a new product which was launched in 2010, our eDiamond a new analyzer providing a troubleshooting solution for LTE, in order to keep current with customer requirements. New or enhanced telecommunications and data communications-related products developed by other companies could be incompatible with our products. Therefore, our timely access to information concerning, and our ability to anticipate, changes in technology and customer requirements and the emergence of new industry standards, as well as our ability to develop, manufacture and market new and enhanced products successfully and on a timely basis, will be significant factors in our ability to remain competitive. For example, many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements of application providers of 3G and 3.5G cellular and triple-play networks. If networking evolves toward greater emphasis on application providers, we believe that we have positioned ourselves well relative to our key competitors. If it does not, however, our initiatives and investments in this area may be of no or limited value. As a result we cannot quantify the impact of new product introductions on our future operations. Our sales derived from emerging market countries may be materially adversely affected by economic, regulatory and political developments in those countries. We generate sales from various emerging market countries. As sales from these countries represent a significant portion of our total sales and as these countries represent a significant portion of our expected growth, economic or political turmoil in these countries could materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations. Our investments in emerging market countries may also be subject to risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable taxation treatment, exchange controls, challenges in protecting our intellectual property rights, nationalization, inflation, currency fluctuations, or the absence of, or unexpected changes in, regulation as well as other unforeseeable operational risks. Pg. 8 Our inventory may become obsolete or unusable. We make advance purchases of various component parts in relatively large quantities to ensure that we have an adequate and readily available supply. Our failure to accurately project our needs for these components and the demand for our products that incorporate them, or changes in our business strategy or technology that reduce our need for these components, could result in these components becoming obsolete prior to their intended use or otherwise unusable in our business. This would result in a write-off of inventories for these components. Any reversal or slowdown in deregulation of telecommunications markets could materially harm the markets for our products. Future growth in the markets for our products will depend, in part, on the continued privatization, deregulation and the restructuring of telecommunications markets worldwide, as the demand for our products is generally higher when a competitive environment exists. Any reversal or slowdown in the pace of this privatization, deregulation or restructuring could materially harm the markets for our products. Moreover, the consequences of deregulation are subject to many uncertainties, including judicial and administrative proceedings that affect the pace at which the changes contemplated by deregulation occur, and other regulatory, economic and political factors. Furthermore, the uncertainties associated with deregulation have in the past, and could in the future, cause our customers to delay purchasing decisions pending the resolution of these uncertainties. Many of our customers require a lengthy, detailed and comprehensive evaluation process before they order our products. Our sales process has been subject to delays that have significantly decreased our revenues and which could result in the eventual cancellations of some sale opportunities. We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of products and related services for telecommunications service providers. The purchase of our products represents a relatively significant capital expenditure for our customers. As a result, our products generally undergo a lengthy evaluation process before we can sell them. In recent years, our customers have been conducting a more stringent and detailed evaluation of our products and decisions are subject to additional levels of internal review. This trend has intensified recently as part of the recent economic environment. As a result, the evaluation process has significantly lengthened. This evaluation process generally takes between six and 18 months. The following factors, among others, affect the length of the approval process: · the time involved for our customers to determine and announce their specifications; · the time required for our customers to process approvals for purchasing decisions; · the complexity of the products involved; · the technological priorities and budgets of our customers; and · the need for our customers to obtain or comply with any required regulatory approvals. If customers continue to subject our products to lengthy evaluation processes or to delay project approval, delays lengthen further, or such continued delays result in the eventual cancellation of any sale opportunities, it could harm our business and results of operations. Our visibility of future sales is severely limited due to the short lead time of customer orders. As a result of the short lead time for firm purchase orders, we are unable to accurately forecast future revenues from product sales. As a result, even dramatic fluctuations in revenue (whether increase or decrease) might not be detected until the very end of a financial quarter, which may not enable us to monitor costs in a timely manner to compensate for such fluctuations. Pg. 9 We may undertake further reorganizations, which may adversely impact our operations, and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior or any future reorganizations. We continue to reorganize and transform our business to realign resources and achieve desired cost savings in an increasingly competitive market. Although during 2010 we increased our work force, during 2007, 2008 and 2009, we undertook a series of reorganizations of our operations involving, among other things, the reduction of our workforce. If we reduce our workforce in the future, we may incur additional reorganization and related expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have based our reorganization efforts on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our businesses. Our assumptions may or may not be correct, and we may also determine that further reorganizations will be needed in the future. We therefore cannot assure you that we will realize all of the anticipated benefits of the reorganizations or that we will not further reduce or otherwise adjust our workforce or exit, or dispose of, certain businesses. Any decision by management to further limit investment, exit, or dispose of businesses may result in the recording of additional reorganization charges, and might also adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from our business. As a result, the costs actually incurred in connection with the reorganization efforts may be higher than originally planned and may not lead to the anticipated cost savings and/or improved results. In addition, employees, whether or not directly affected by reorganizations, may seek future employment with our business partners, customers or competitors. We cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will not be compromised by any such employees who terminate their employment with us. Further, we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, incentivize and retain highly skilled personnel. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce reductions. Our non-competition agreements with our employees may not be enforceable. If any of these employees leaves us and joins a competitor, our competitor could benefit from the expertise our former employee gained while working for us. We currently have non-competition agreements with our key and other employees in Israel. These agreements prohibit those employees, while they work for us and after they cease to work for us, from directly competing with us or working for our competitors. Under current U.S. and Israeli law, we may not be able to enforce these non-competition agreements. If we are unable to enforce any of these agreements, our competitors that employ our former employees could benefit from the expertise our former employees gained while working for us. In addition, we have non-competition agreements with employees outside of Israel, and we can not guarantee that such agreements are enforceable under applicable law. Our business could be harmed if we were to lose the services of one or more members of our senior management team, or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our future growth and success depends to a significant extent upon the continuing services of our executive officers and other key employees. We do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our employees. Competition for qualified management and other high-level telecommunications industry personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. If we lose the services of any key employees, we may not be able to manage our business successfully or to achieve our business objectives. Pg. 10 Our success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified technical, sales, finance and management personnel. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications. If we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications, our revenues and product development efforts could be harmed. Regulatory changes may cause us to incur increased costs. Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies may increase our expenses as we may have to devote resources to respond to these new requirements. In particular, we incurred and may incur additional general administrative expenses to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires management to report on internal controls over financial reporting. Compliance with new rules, like the change from US GAAP reporting to IFRS, could require the further commitment of significant financial resources and result in the diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities. Finally, the impact of these changes could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers, which could harm our business. We may lose significant market share as a result of intense competition in the markets for our existing and future products. Many companies compete with us in the market for network testing and service monitoring solutions. We expect that competition will increase in the future, both with respect to products that we currently offer and products that we are developing. Moreover, manufacturers of data communications and telecommunications equipment, which are current and potential customers of ours, may in the future incorporate into their products capabilities similar to ours, which would reduce the demand for our products. In addition, affiliates of ours that currently provide services to us may, in the future, compete with us. Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater resources, including financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing and marketing and distribution capabilities, and several of them may enjoy greater market recognition than us. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors. A failure to do so could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. We are dependent upon the success of distributors and sales representatives who are under no obligation to distribute our products. We are highly dependent upon our distributors for their active marketing and sales efforts and for the distribution of our products, and, to a lesser degree, we are dependent upon our sales representatives in North America. Outside of North America, Brazil and China, many of our distributors are the only entities engaged in the distribution of our products in their respective geographical areas. Typically, our arrangements with them do not prevent our distributors from distributing competing products, or require them to distribute our products in the future. Our distributors may not give a high priority to marketing and supporting our products. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the financial situation, business or marketing strategies of our distributors. Any such changes could occur suddenly and rapidly. Pg. 11 We may lose customers and/or distributors on whom we currently depend and we may not succeed in developing new distribution channels. Our seven largest distributors accounted for a total of approximately 41.8% of our sales in 2010, 44.3% of our sales in 2009 and 57.5% of our sales in 2008. If we terminate or lose any of our distributors or if they downsize significantly, we may not be successful in replacing them on a timely basis, or at all. Any changes in our distribution and sales channels, particularly the loss of a major distributor or our inability to establish effective distribution and sales channels for new products, will impact our ability to sell our products and result in a loss of revenues. Our large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business. Large telecommunications providers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. These customers may require us to develop additional features and may impose penalties on us for failure to deliver such features on a timely basis, or failure to meet performance standards. As we seek to sell more products to large service providers, we may be required to agree to these less advantageous terms and conditions, which may decrease our revenues and/or increase the time it takes to convert orders into revenues, resulting in an adverse affect on our results of operations. The complexity and scope of the solutions we provide to larger service providers is increasing. Larger projects entail greater operational risk and an increased chance of failure. The complexity and scope of the solutions and services we provide to larger service providers is increasing. The larger and more complex such projects are, the greater the operational risks associated with such projects. These risks include failure to fully integrate our products into the service provider’s network, with third party products and complex environments, and our dependence on subcontractors and partners for the successful and timely completion of such projects. Failure to complete a larger project successfully could expose us to potential contractual penalties, claims for breach of contract and in extreme cases, to cancellation of the entire project, or increase the likelihood we have difficulty in collecting payment and recognizing revenues. We could be subject to warranty claims and product recalls, which could be very expensive and harm our financial condition. Products as complex as ours sometimes contain undetected errors. These errors can cause delays in product introductions or require design modifications. In addition, we are dependent on other suppliers for key components that are incorporated in our products. Defects in systems in which our products are deployed, whether resulting from faults in our products or products supplied by others, due to faulty installation or any other cause, may result in customer dissatisfaction, product returns and, potentially, product liability claims being filed against us. Our warranties permit customers to return defective products for repair. The warranty period is for one year. During the past few years, customer returns have not been substantial. Any failure of a system in which our products are deployed (whether or not our products are the cause), any product recall or product liability claims with any associated negative publicity, could result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products and harm to our business. Pg. 12 We incorporate open source technology in our products, which may expose us to liability and have a material impact on our product development and sales. Some of our products utilize open source technologies. These technologies are licensed to us on varying license structures, including the General Public License. This license and others like it pose a potential risk to products in the event they are inappropriately integrated. In the event that we have not, or do not in the future, properly integrate software that is subject to such licenses into our products, we may be required to disclose our own source code to the public, which could enable our competitors to eliminate any technological advantage that our products may have over theirs. Any such requirement to disclose our source code or other confidential information related to our products could, therefore, materially adversely affect our competitive advantage and impact our business results of operations and financial condition. We depend on limited sources for key components and if we are unable to obtain these components when needed, we will experience delays in manufacturing our products. We currently obtain key components for our products from either a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. We do not have long-term supply contracts with any of our existing suppliers. This presents the following risks: · Delays in delivery or shortages in components could interrupt and delay manufacturing and result in cancellations of orders for our products. · Suppliers could increase component prices significantly and with immediate effect. · We may not be able to locate alternative sources for product components. · Suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of components used in our products. This may require us to modify our products, which may cause delays in product shipments, increased manufacturing costs and increased product prices. · We may be required to hold more inventory than would be immediately required in order to avoid problems from shortages or discontinuance. · We have experienced delays and shortages in the supply of components on more than one occasion in the past. This resulted in delays in our delivering products to our customers. We depend on a limited number of independent manufacturers, which reduces our ability to control our manufacturing process. We rely on a limited number of independent manufacturers, some of which are small, privately held companies, to provide certain assembly services to our specifications. We do not have any long-term supply agreements with any third-party manufacturers. If our assembly services are reduced or interrupted, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected until we are able to establish sufficient assembly services from alternative sources. Alternative manufacturing sources may not be able to meet our future requirements, and existing or alternative sources may not continue to be available to us at favorable prices. Pg. 13 Our proprietary technology is difficult to protect, and unauthorized use of our proprietary technology by third parties may impair our ability to compete effectively. Our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely upon a combination of contractual rights, software licenses, trade secrets, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products and technologies. In addition, we sometimes enter into non-competition, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, distributors and manufacturers’ representatives, and certain suppliers with access to sensitive information. However, we have no registered patents, and these measures may not be adequate to protect our technology from third-party infringement. Additionally, effective trademark, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer, or intend to offer, our products. We may expand our business or enhance our technology through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses. This could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition. Part of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue partnerships and acquisitions that provide us access to complementary technologies and accelerate our penetration into new markets. The negotiation of acquisitions, investments or joint ventures, as well as the integration of acquired or jointly developed businesses or technologies, could divert our management’s time and resources. Acquired businesses, technologies or joint ventures may not be successfully integrated with our products and operations. We may not realize the intended benefits of any acquisition, investment or joint venture and we may incur future losses from any acquisition, investment or joint venture. In addition, acquisitions could result in: · substantial cash expenditures; · potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities; · the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; · a decrease in our profit margins; and · amortization of intangibles and potential impairment of goodwill. If we implement our growth strategy by acquiring other businesses, and this disrupts our operations, our business may suffer. Because we received grants from the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist, we are subject to ongoing restrictions. We received royalty-bearing grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor (the "Chief Scientist"), for research and development programs that meet specified criteria. In addition to our obligation to pay to the Chief Scientist royalties on revenues from products developed pursuant such programs or deriving therefrom (and related services) , our ability to transfer such know-how, especially outside of Israel, is limited, regardless of whether the royalties were fully paid. Any non-Israeli citizen, resident or entity that, among other things, becomes a holder of 5% or more of our share capital or voting rights, is entitled to appoint one or more of our directors or our chief executive officer, or serves as one of our directors or as our chief executive officer (including holders of 25% or more of the voting power, equity or the right to nominate directors in such direct holder), is required to notify the Chief Scientist of the same and to undertake to the Chief Scientist to observe the law governing the grant programs of the Chief Scientist, the principal restrictions of which are the transferability limits described above. Pg. 14 We may be subject to litigation and other claims, including without limitation, regarding infringement claims or claims that we have violated intellectual property rights, which could seriously harm our business. Third parties may from time to time assert against us infringement claims or claims that we have violated a patent or infringed a copyright, trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them. If such infringement were found to exist, we might be required to modify our products or intellectual property or to obtain a license or right to use such technology or intellectual property. Any infringement claim, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, in May 2010, we received a notice from the Chief Scientist regarding alleged miscalculations in the amount of royalties paid by us to the Chief Scientist for the years 1992-2009 and the basis revenues of which the company has to pay royalties. We believe that all royalties due to the Chief Scientist from the sale of products developed with funding provided by the Chief Scientist during such years were properly paid or were otherwise accrued as of December 31, 2010. We are currently in the process of reviewing such alleged miscalculation differences with the Chief Scientist. Currently we are unable to assess the merits of the aforesaid arguments raised by the Chief Scientist. If such royalties were not properly paid or otherwise accrued, any such differences could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources. Yehuda Zisapel and Zohar Zisapel beneficially own, in aggregate, approximately 38.6% of our ordinary shares and, therefore, have significant influence over the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors. As of March 31, 2011, Yehuda Zisapel and Zohar Zisapel (the Chairman of our Board of Directors), who are brothers, may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 2,500,375 ordinary shares, including options and warrants exercisable for 118,986 ordinary shares that are exercisable within 60 days of March 31, 2011, representing approximately 38.6% of our outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, despite the fact that each one of them, to our knowledge, operates independently from the other with respect to his respective shareholding of our shares, Yehuda Zisapel and Zohar Zisapel have significant influence over the outcome of various actions that require shareholder approval, including the election of our directors. In addition, Yehuda Zisapel and Zohar Zisapel may be able to delay or prevent a transaction in which shareholders might receive a premium over the prevailing market price for their shares and prevent changes in control or in management. We engage in transactions, and may compete, with companies controlled by Yehuda Zisapel and Zohar Zisapel, which may result in potential conflicts. We are engaged in, and expect to continue to be engaged in, numerous transactions with companies controlled by Yehuda Zisapel and Zohar Zisapel. We believe that such transactions are beneficial to us and are generally conducted upon terms that are no less favorable to us than would be available from unaffiliated third parties. Nevertheless, these transactions may result in a conflict of interest between what is best for us and the interests of the other parties in such transactions. In addition, several products of such affiliated companies may be used in place of our products, and it is possible that direct competition between us and one or more of such affiliated companies may develop in the future. Moreover, opportunities to develop, manufacture, or sell new products (or otherwise enter new fields) may arise in the future and may be pursued by one or more affiliated companies instead of or in competition with us. This could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Pg. 15 If we fail to adapt appropriately to the challenges associated with operating internationally, the expected growth of our business may be impeded and our operating results may be affected. While we are headquartered in Israel, approximately 95.0% of our sales in 2010, 96.6% of our sales in 2009 and 98.1% of our sales in 2008 were generated outside of Israel, including in North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia. Our international sales will be limited if we cannot establish and maintain relationships with international distributors, set up additional foreign operations, expand international sales channel management, hire additional personnel, develop relationships with international service providers and operate adequate after-sales support internationally. Even if we are able to successfully expand our international operations, we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: · challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations due to the limited number of qualified candidates, employment laws and business practices in foreign countries, any of which could increase the cost and reduce the efficiency of operating in foreign countries; · our inability to comply with import/export, environmental and other trade compliance and other regulations of the countries in which we do business, together with unexpected changes in such regulations; · insufficient measures to ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future; · our failure to adhere to laws, regulations and contractual obligations relating to customer contracts in various countries; · our inability to maintain a competitive list of distributors for indirect sales; · tariffs and other trade barriers; · economic instability in foreign markets; · wars, acts of terrorism and political unrest; · language and cultural barriers; · lack of integration of foreign operations; · currency fluctuations; · potential foreign and domestic tax consequences; · technology standards that differ from those on which our products are based, which could require expensive redesign and retention of personnel familiar with those standards; · longer accounts receivable payment cycles and possible difficulties in collecting payments, which may increase our operating costs and hurt our financial performance; and · failure to meet certification requirements. Any of these factors could harm our international operations and negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The continuing weakness in these economies or other foreign economies could have a significant negative effect on our future operating results. Because most of our revenues are generated in U.S. dollars but a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in New Israeli Shekels, our results of operations may be seriously harmed by currency fluctuations and inflation. Although we sell in markets throughout the world, most of our revenues are generated in U.S dollars, and the majority of our cost of revenues is incurred in transactions denominated in dollars. Accordingly, we consider the U.S. dollar to be our functional currency. However, a significant portion of our expenses is in NIS, mainly related to employee expenses. Therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates between the NIS and the U.S. dollar may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As of today we have not entered into any hedging transactions in order to mitigate these risks. We may also be exposed to this risk to the extent that the rate of inflation in Israel exceeds the rate of potential devaluation of the NIS in relation to the dollar or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind inflation in Israel. In either event, the dollar cost of our operations in Israel will increase and our dollar-measured results of operations will be adversely affected. Pg. 16 Moreover, as currently our revenues are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, devaluation in the local currencies of our customers relative to the U.S. dollar could cause customers to default on payment. An increasing portion of our revenues is now denominated in Euros, and in the future additional revenues may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, thereby exposing us to gains and losses on non-U.S. currency transactions. Any inability to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 regarding having effective internal control procedures may negatively impact the report on our financial statements to be provided by our independent auditors. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The SEC, as directed by Section 404 ("Section 404") of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company’s internal control over financial reporting in its annual report on Form 10-K or Form 20-F, as the case may be, that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. In addition, when the public float of our shares exceeds $75 million, the Company’s independent registered public accountants will be required to attest to and report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our management may not conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective. Moreover, even if our management does conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, if the independent accountants are not satisfied with our internal controls, or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, or operated, they may issue an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting. Any of these possible outcomes could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could negatively impact the market price of our shares. Further, we may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our assessments of our internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in investigation or sanctions by regulatory authorities and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, investor confidence in our reported financial information and the market price of our ordinary shares. If we determine that we are not in compliance with Section 404, we may be required to implement new internal controls procedures and re-evaluate our financial reporting. We may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses as well as outside auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. Further, we may need to hire additional qualified personnel in order for us to be compliant with Section 404. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in our conclusion that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. Pg. 17 If we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences. As more fully described below in "Item 10—Additional Information—Taxation—United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Taxation of U.S. Holders of Ordinary Shares—Passive Foreign Investment Company Status," if for any taxable year 75% or more of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the fair market value of our assets, averaged quarterly over our taxable year, that produce (or are held for the production of) passive income, we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company ("PFIC") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The market capitalization approach has generally been used to determine the fair market value of the assets of a publicly traded corporation, although the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the courts have accepted other valuation methods in certain valuation contexts. If we are classified as a PFIC, our U.S. shareholders could suffer adverse United States tax consequences, including gain on the disposition of our ordinary shares being treated as ordinary income and any resulting U.S. federal income tax being increased by an interest charge. Rules similar to those applicable to dispositions generally will apply to certain "excess distributions" in respect of our ordinary shares. For our 2010 taxable year, we believe that we should not be classified as a PFIC. However, there are no assurances that the IRS will agree with our conclusion or that we will not become a PFIC in subsequent taxable years. U.S. shareholders should consult with their own U.S. tax advisors with respect to the U.S. tax consequences of investing in our ordinary shares. The market price of our ordinary shares has and may continue to fluctuate widely, which has adversely affected and could adversely affect us and our shareholders. From January 1, 2010 to April 1, 2011, our ordinary shares have traded as high as $14.71 and as low as $1.60 per share. As of April 1, 2011, the closing price of our ordinary shares was $9.83 per share. The market price of our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including the following: · market conditions or trends in our industry and the economy as a whole; · political, economic and other developments in the State of Israel and worldwide; · actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or those of our competitors; · announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new and enhanced products; · changes in the market valuations of our competitors; · introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us or our competitors; · trends in the communications or software industries, including industry consolidation; · acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or others in our industry; · changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by financial analysts; · changes in our shareholder base; and · additions or departures of key personnel. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Israeli and technology companies in particular, has been highly volatile. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may materially adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our performance. Shareholders may not be able to resell their ordinary shares following periods of volatility because of the market’s adverse reaction to such volatility, and we may not be able to raise capital through an offering of securities. Pg. 18 From time to time we may need to raise financing. If adequate funds are not available on terms favorable to us or to our shareholders, our operations and growth strategy will be materially adversely affected. From time to time we may be required to raise financing in connection with our operations and growth strategy. We do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, or whether it will be available on terms favorable to us. This may prove even more challenging due to the recent global economic downturn. If adequate funds are not available on terms favorable to us or to our shareholders, our operations will be materially adversely affected. We may not satisfy the NASDAQ Capital Market’s requirements for continued listing. If we cannot satisfy these requirements, NASDAQ could delist our ordinary shares. Our ordinary shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol RDCM. To continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we will need to satisfy a number of conditions, including a minimum of $2.5 million in shareholders’ equity and a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share. On November 9, 2009, we received a NASDAQ Staff deficiency letter informing us that, as of September 30, 2009, our shareholders’ equity was $63,000 below the NASDAQ Capital Market minimum requirement for continued listing. On November 17, 2009, Mr. Zohar Zisapel, our Chairman of the Board and largest shareholder, exercised warrants to purchase 20,313 ordinary shares at an exercise price of $3.20 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $65,000. Following Mr. Zisapel’s warrant exercise, our shareholders’ equity was above the $2.5 million minimum requirement. The NASDAQ Staff informed us that it will continue to monitor our ongoing compliance with the minimum shareholders’ equity requirement. Our shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2010 was $11.1 million, and we believe that, as of the date of this Annual Report, our shareholders’ equity remains above the $2.5 million minimum requirement for continued listing. In addition, beginning on November 17, 2008 our share price decreased below the $1.00 minimum bid price per share. However, due to the extraordinary market conditions, NASDAQ implemented a temporary suspension on the enforcement of the minimum $1.00 bid price listing requirement for continued listing until July 20, 2009. Our share price continued to be below the $1.00 minimum bid price per share until September 9, 2009. Since September 9, 2009, and as of the date of this Annual Report, our share price has continued to be above the minimum $1.00 bid price. As of April 1, 2011, the closing price of our ordinary shares on the NASDAQ was $9.83 per share. Despite the continued improvement of our financial results during 2010, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum shareholders’ equity requirement or the minimum bid requirement, or that we will be able to continue to meet the other continued listing requirements of NASDAQ Capital Market in the future. If we fail to comply with any of the continued listing requirements, we could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market. If we are delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, trading in our ordinary shares may be conducted, if available, on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board Service or another medium. In the event of such delisting, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of our ordinary shares, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our ordinary shares could be severely limited. In addition, in the event of such delisting, we may be required to comply with reporting obligations under the Israeli securities laws, in addition to the reporting obligations under the SEC rules, which could distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. Pg. 19 The trading volume of our shares has been low in the past and may be low in the future, resulting in lower than expected market prices for our shares. Our shares have been traded at low volumes in the past and may be traded at low volumes in the future for reasons related or unrelated to our performance. This low trading volume may result in lesser liquidity and lower than expected market prices for our ordinary shares, and our shareholders may not be able to resell their shares for more than they paid for them. We are affected by volatility in the securities markets. The securities markets in general have experienced volatility which has particularly affected the securities of many high-technology companies and particularly those in the fields of communications, software and Internet, including companies that have a significant presence in Israel. This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies and may cause difficulties in raising additional financing required to effectively operate and grow their businesses. Such difficulties and the volatility of the securities markets in general may affect our financial results. Risks Related to Our Location in Israel Conditions in Israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to produce and sell our products. We are incorporated under Israeli law and our principal offices and manufacturing and research and development facilities are located in the State of Israel. Political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and a state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. We could be adversely affected by hostilities involving Israel, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, a significant increase in inflation, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. Since October 2000, there has been a marked increase in hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians, which has adversely affected the peace process and has negatively influenced Israel’s relationship with several Arab countries. Also, the political and security situation in Israel may result in certain parties with whom we have contracts claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments pursuant to force majeure provisions of those contracts. In January 2006, Hamas, an Islamic movement responsible for many attacks against Israelis, won the majority of the seats in the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority. The election of a majority of Hamas-supported candidates posed a major obstacle to relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as to the stability in the Middle East as a whole. During the third quarter of 2006, Israel was engaged in war with the Hezbollah in Lebanon; however, the war did not materially affect the Company’s results. There have been extensive hostilities along Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip since June 2007 when Hamas effectively took control of the Gaza Strip. Following seizing control over the Gaza Strip, Hamas has launched hundreds of missiles from the Gaza Strip against Israeli population centers, disrupting day-to-day civilian life in southern Israel. This led to an armed conflict between Israel and Hamas during December 2008 and January 2009, and at the beginning of 2011, a party identified with the Hezbollah took control over the Lebanese government. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Furthermore, since the beginning of 2011 Egypt has witnessed an increased instability of its government and deterioration of its control over Egypt's internal affairs. This and further deterioration could have an adverse effect on the relations between Israel and Egypt, which have been parties to a peace treaty since the late 1970s. Ongoing violence between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as tension between Israel and terror organizations and other countries in the Middle East, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pg. 20 Since our manufacturing facilities are located exclusively in Israel, we could experience disruption of our manufacturing due to acts of terrorism or any other hostilities involving or threatening Israel. If an attack were to occur, any Israeli military response that results in the call to duty of the country’s reservists (as further discussed below) could affect the performance of our Israeli facilities for the short term. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not believe that the political and security situation has had any material impact on our business to date; however, we can give no assurance that it will have no such effect in the future. Some neighboring countries, as well as certain companies and organizations, continue to participate in a boycott of Israeli firms and others doing business with Israel or with Israeli companies. We are also precluded from marketing our products to certain of these countries due to U.S. and Israeli regulatory restrictions. Because none of our revenue is currently derived from sales to these countries, we believe that the boycott has not had a material adverse effect on us. However, restrictive laws, policies or practices directed towards Israel or Israeli businesses could have an adverse impact on the expansion of our business. Our results of operations may be negatively affected by the obligation of our personnel to perform military service. All male adult citizens and permanent residents of Israel under the age of 51 are, unless exempt, obligated to perform military reserve duty annually. Additionally, these residents are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances. Some of our officers and employees are currently obligated to perform military reserve duty from time to time. In the event of a military conflict, including the ongoing conflict with the Palestinians, these persons could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time and on very short notice. The absence of a number of our officers and employees for significant periods could disrupt our operations and harm our business. Given these requirements, we believe that we have operated relatively efficiently since beginning our operations. However, we cannot assess what the full impact of these requirements on our workforce or business would be if the situation with the Palestinians or any other adversaries changes, and we cannot predict the effect on our business operations of any expansion or reduction of these military reserve requirements. We currently benefit from government programs and tax benefits that may be discontinued or reduced. We currently receive grants and potential tax benefits under Government of Israel programs. At December 31, 2010, our contingent liability to the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor in respect of research grants received was approximately $28.7 million. In order to maintain our eligibility for these programs and benefits, we must continue to meet specific conditions, including making specific investments in fixed assets and paying royalties with respect to grants received. In addition, some of these programs restrict our ability to manufacture particular products outside of Israel or to transfer particular technology. If we fail to comply with these conditions in the future, the benefits received could be canceled and we could be required to refund any payments previously received under these programs, or to pay increased taxes. These programs and tax benefits may be discontinued or curtailed in the future. If we do not receive these grants in the future, we will have to allocate funds to product development at the expense of other operational costs. The amount, if any, by which our taxes will increase depends upon the rate of any tax increase, the amount of any tax benefit reduction and the amount of any taxable income that we may earn in the future. If the Government of Israel discontinues or curtails these programs and tax benefits, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Pg. 21 Provisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make difficult a merger or acquisition of us, which could prevent a change of control and depress the market price of our shares. The Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 (the "Israeli Companies Law") generally requires that a merger be approved by a company’s board of directors and by a majority of the shares voting on the proposed merger. Unless a court rules otherwise, a statutory merger will not be deemed approved if shares representing a majority of the voting power present at the shareholders meeting, and which are not held by the potential merger partner (or by any person who holds 25% or more of the shares of capital stock or the right to appoint 25% or more of the directors of the potential merger partner or its general manager), vote against the merger. Upon the request of any creditor of a party to the proposed merger, a court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there is a reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the surviving company will be unable to satisfy its obligations. In addition, a merger may generally not be completed unless at least (i) 50 days have passed since the filing of the merger proposal with the Israeli Registrar of Companies by each of the merging companies, and (ii) 30 days have passed since the merger was approved by the shareholders of each of the parties to the merger. Finally, Israeli tax law treats some acquisitions, such as stock-for-stock exchanges between an Israeli company and a foreign company less favorably than do U.S. tax laws. For example, Israeli tax law may, under certain circumstances, subject a shareholder who exchanges his ordinary shares for shares in another corporation to taxation prior to the sale of the shares received in such a stock-for-stock swap. These provisions of Israeli corporate and tax law, and the uncertainties surrounding such law, may have the effect of delaying, preventing or making more difficult a merger with us or an acquisition of us. This could prevent a change of control over us and depress our ordinary shares’ market price which otherwise might rise as a result of such a change of control. It may be difficult to (i) effect service of process, (ii) assert U.S. securities laws claims and (iii) enforce U.S. judgments in Israel against directors, officers and auditors named in this Annual Report. We are incorporated in Israel. None of our executive officers or directors named in this Annual Report are residents of the United States. A substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located outside of the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against us or any of those persons or to effect service of process upon those persons. It may also be difficult to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws in original actions instituted in Israel.
