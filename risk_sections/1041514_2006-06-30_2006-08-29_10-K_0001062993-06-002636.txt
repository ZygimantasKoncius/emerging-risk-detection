ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We provide our universal electronic payment system, or UEPS, as an alternative payment system for the unbanked and under-banked populations of developing economies. We believe that we are the first company worldwide to implement a system that can enable the estimated four billion people who generally have limited or no access to a bank account to enter affordably into electronic transactions with each other, government agencies, employers, merchants and other financial service providers. To accomplish this, we have developed and deployed the UEPS. This system uses secure smart cards that operate in real-time but offline, unlike traditional payment systems offered by major banking institutions that require immediate access through a communications network to a centralized computer. This offline capability means that users of our system can enter into transactions at any time with other card holders in even the most remote areas so long as a smart card reader, which is often portable and offline, is available. In addition to payments and purchases, our system can be used for banking, health care management, international money transfers, voting and identification. We generate our revenues by charging transaction fees to government agencies, employers, merchants and other financial service providers, by providing financial services such as loans and insurance products and by selling hardware, software and related technology. Our technology is widely used in South Africa today, where we have over 3.6 million clients in five provinces who receive social welfare grants using our smart cards and increasingly use their smart cards at participating merchants to receive and spend their grants. As part of our strategy to expand into new geographical markets, during fiscal 2006, we announced the formation of joint ventures in Namibia, Botswana and Nigeria to operate UEPS smart card-based switching systems in those countries. As these UEPS systems become operational, we expect to generate revenues from sales of equipment, software and related technology to the joint ventures and from our share of the revenues earned by the ventures from operation of the switching systems. On July 3, 2006, we acquired Prism Holdings Limited, or Prism, a South African public company, which focuses on the development and provision of secure transaction technology, solutions and services. Prisms core competencies around secure online transaction processing, cryptography and integrated circuit card (chip/smart card) technologies are principally applied to electronic commerce transactions in the telecommunications, banking, retail, petroleum and utilities market sectors. These technologies form the cornerstones of the trusted transactions environment and provide us with the building blocks for developing secure end-to-end payment solutions. We believe that Prism will help us expand our merchant footprint in South Africa, extend our ability to deliver solutions across the entire spectrum of transaction processing and assist us in expanding our international operations. Since we completed the Prism acquisition after the close of our 2006 fiscal year, Prisms operations are not reflected in our financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2006. We are headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 as a Florida corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in 1989. Under --Corporate History below, we describe the historical development of our business, including the June 2004 acquisition of Net 1 Applied Technologies Holdings Limited, or Aplitec, which was a South African public company. All references to Net1,, the Company, we, us, or our are references to Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively, except as otherwise indicated or where the context indicates otherwise. 2 Market Opportunity According to the United States Census Bureau, the worlds population currently exceeds 6.5 billion people. Yet of this total, it has been reported that over four billion people earn less than the purchasing parity equivalent of two dollars per day. In general, these people either have no bank account or very limited access to banking services. This situation arises when banking fees are too high relative to an individuals income, a bank account provides little or no meaningful benefit or there is insufficient infrastructure to provide banking services economically in the individuals geographic location. We refer to these people as the unbanked and the under-banked. These individuals generally receive wages, welfare benefits, money transfers or loans in the form of cash and conduct commercial transactions, including buying food and clothing, in cash. The use of cash, however, presents significant problems. In the case of recipients, they generally have no secure way of protecting their cash other than by converting it immediately into goods, carrying it with them or hiding it. In cases where an individual has access to a bank account, the typical deposit, withdrawal and account fees meaningfully reduce the money available to meet basic needs. For government agencies and employers, using cash to pay welfare benefits or wages results in significant expense due to the logistics of obtaining that cash, moving it to distribution points and protecting it from theft. The use of cash or lack of access to a bank account can dramatically increase the cost to, and in some cases completely prevent, individuals from engaging in basic financial transactions. These basic transactions include the routine payment of insurance premiums, the transfer of money to relatives and the use of credit. Without a bank account, it is also difficult for an individual to obtain a loan on attractive terms since that individual lacks a credit history and usually cannot present a reliable means of repayment to the lender. For governments, assistance programs face significant challenges when dependent on the use of cash. In addition to the costs and difficulties of using cash, corruption becomes an even more challenging problem since there is no clear audit trail. In fact, the absence of an electronic system for the distribution of goods, including foodstuff or medicine, or welfare benefits presents a significant obstacle to ensuring the fair and reliable implementation of government policy or deployment of foreign aid. Traditional payment systems offered today by the major banking institutions do not address the key requirements of the unbanked and the under-banked populations. In addition to the high cost of maintaining a bank account relative to a customers income level, customers must generally have basic literacy, administrative and record-keeping abilities and a minimum income level. Additionally, banks operate through online transaction settlement systems, which are often unavailable or costly to implement in undeveloped areas. Finally, having a bank account does not eliminate the need for significant quantities of cash in many instances because customers must withdraw large sums at one time to avoid incremental transaction fees. Our Solution We believe that we are the first company to enable the affordable delivery of financial products and services to the worlds unbanked and under-banked people. Our approach takes full advantage of moving processing away from a centralized point to the computer chip embedded on a smart card. A smart card reader, or POS device, is used to enable communication between smart cards in real-time during a transaction and indirectly with our mainframe computer at a later time. This architecture has significant implications in terms of the products and services that we can deliver compared to those offered by banking institutions or other card providers. First, our system enables offline transactions, which is essential in serving the unbanked and under-banked. Second, it means that while offline, the smart card can engage in sophisticated transaction processing, using data encryption and biometric fingerprint protection to ensure security. In fact, our smart cards can calculate the interest owed to the card holder for having funds recorded onto our system without ever coming online. Third, with all of the software and transaction records on the smart card, the POS device itself requires far fewer components, circuitry and memory, substantially reducing costs. Fourth, each transaction is recorded on both participating smart cards, copied in subsequent transactions to additional smart cards, and ultimately reported to our mainframe computer. This creates a full audit trail that significantly reduces the potential for corruption, theft and fraud. Lastly, instead of having to build the overall system to handle peak loads, our system further reduces costs by smoothing the transaction flow over time. We believe that our solution delivers benefits to each of the users of our system, including: 3 Individuals. There is no minimum income requirement for individuals to use our smart card, making our solution universally accessible. It is also inexpensive since the overall cost of the system is much less than widely available solutions, including cash, bank accounts and bank cards that require online access. Our solution additionally has the advantage of working everywhere, including remote areas where many unbanked and under-banked people live. Even more importantly, our solution is secure and smart cards are replaceable. This means that individuals do not have to fear that their money will be stolen or that they will be charged for fraudulent transactions as all transactions are verified biometrically through fingerprints. Since the smart card performs all of the required computing processing and contains all of the different service features, the smart card can be tailored to meet the needs of the individual. Card holders can also receive interest on their card balances, a benefit not available to them when transacting solely in cash. We believe our solution has the potential to enhance significantly the living standards of the unbanked and under-banked by reducing transaction costs and providing them with new and additional financial products and services. Merchants and Financial Service Providers. Merchants derive several different benefits from our system. Our system decreases the amount of cash they must hold, improving security and reducing expenses, such as cash deposit fees and cash losses. By providing financial services through our POS devices, merchants also benefit from new income streams at no additional incremental cost. In addition, our system provides a record of transactions that is useful for administrative purposes. For formal financial service providers, the use of smart cards provides opportunities to directly sell products and services to a market that was previously difficult to reach. For instance, insurance companies can offer their products with the premium deducted directly from the individuals smart card. In the case of lending, administrative costs are decreased along with the expense of holding cash. Again, the collection of payments can occur directly from the smart card, reducing credit risk and helping to establish credit history. Employers. Our system enables employers to eliminate cash from the wage payment process. This reduces expenses by avoiding cash handling and management, the need to insure, secure and transport that cash and the bank transaction fees associated with obtaining cash in the first place. The process of paying employees using cash is also time consuming, taking up to half a day per pay period in some instances. The use of our system eliminates this process and thereby increases productivity. In addition, because cash payments are distributed in packets to employees, disputes can arise as to the amount of cash in the packet. Our system also eliminates this problem since the amount reflected on the card holders accounts are recorded on the back-end system and then distributed on the smart cards. Finally, employers frequently provide additional services to their employees out of necessity, particularly loans. Our system enables other service providers to deliver these products. Government Agencies. A fundamental policy goal for almost any government is to enhance the welfare of the poorest citizens in the country. Yet the use of cash is a poor method for delivering social welfare grants since it is difficult to track, and the recipients endure a range of expenses and dangers that reduce their options. By using our system, government agencies enjoy reduced costs in the delivery of benefits to recipients by eliminating the use of cash while increasing the options available to the recipient. This use of our system intrinsically increases the welfare that government agencies can provide from the same amount of taxes collected. Our system also has the potential to increase the amount of taxes collected by bringing informal businesses into the formal economy. The presence of a full audit trail also means that government agencies can combat corruption. Moreover, the use of smart cards for the delivery of additional services, including insurance products, means that regulatory bodies can expand their oversight of transactions for individuals who are frequently least able to protect themselves. In regard to medical benefits, our system provides comprehensive inventory management and has the potential to improve the treatment of patients significantly. For instance, we have deployed an artificial intelligence program on our smart cards used for the treatment of HIV/AIDS in South Africa that can be used to adjust a patients prescription based on data entered by a trained medical worker through the POS device. Our Business Strengths We believe our business strengths include: Technology Leadership. We believe we are the first company to develop, implement and operate an affordable, flexible and secure electronic payment system for the unbanked and under-banked that works offline. Of equal importance, our smart cards are secured through biometric fingerprint authentication and have a broad range of additional functionality through the use of wallets that can be turned on as needed or as services become available. We can deliver these services to the unbanked population at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems. Our ability to implement an HIV/AIDS system on the same smart card as financial services demonstrates the flexibility of our approach. In addition, we have validated the security of our smart cards along with our overall system, forming the foundation for a trusted solution. Independent third parties have reviewed and published our security protocols and we have refined our system in a way to provide system integrity over the life of the smart cards. From our inception in 1989 to date, we have not suffered any security breaches or losses of transactions or funds on our 4 system. Our recent acquisition of Prism gives us access to Prisms well-established core cryptography, software, hardware, embedded chip, wireless and payment expertise. Proven Solution. Our system is proven and has been increasingly used. Today over 3.6 million clients in South Africa receive monthly welfare or pension payments through our system under contracts with five provinces. Historically, welfare and pension recipients would only download cash from smart cards, but since we began our merchant acquiring initiative in July 2004, these recipients increasingly choose to use their smart cards at merchant locations, which generates additional revenue for us. During the year ended June 30, 2005, the number of our clients that opted to receive their grants through our retail infrastructure grew to approximately 474,000 clients and for the year ended June 30, 2006, the retail infrastructure was utilized by approximately 849,000 clients. For the years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, the total value of transactions processed through our UEPS merchant network was approximately $614 million and $133 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2006, we had 4,038 POS devices installed at 2,381 participating retail merchants compared to June 30, 2005, when we had 3,235 POS devices installed at 1,880 participating retail merchants Versatile Application. Once an individual begins using our smart card, we become a logical provider of a broad range of additional products and services. For instance, a card holder using our system for the administration of medical treatment can also use the same smart card for receiving welfare payments or wages as well as making purchases. Because use of each smart card is secured biometrically, the smart card can also be used for identification and voting. The additional uses mean that once we have enrolled and delivered a smart card to an individual, our revenue potential increases significantly beyond the initial service for which that individual has signed up. Broad Appeal that Drives Opportunities. Because our system provides economic benefits to all participants, we believe there are strong incentives for government agencies and employers to adopt our system in many developing countries. Our solution is also appealing because a single deployment enables the delivery of a broad array of new services to those who are potentially most in need of them, often at a lower cost than alternative distribution methods. Increasing Returns to Scale. The initial establishment of our system in a province or country requires upfront expenditures for computers, distribution infrastructure and card holder registration. Once in place, though, the cost to us of supplying additional products to users is low. For instance, if a customer receives welfare payments on one of our smart cards and then chooses to purchase insurance through our system, there is almost no additional expense for us to deduct the insurance premium regularly. As a result, the operating margin for that customer increases significantly, offset only by any marketing or administrative costs associated with that product. Our Strategy We intend to provide the leading system for the worlds estimated four billion unbanked and under-banked people to engage in electronic transactions globally. To achieve this goal, we intend to pursue the following strategies: Disciplined Approach to New Markets. We carefully evaluate new opportunities in order to deploy our business development resources effectively. We believe there are significant opportunities for our system in the developing countries of Africa, Central and South America and the Asia-Pacific Rim, where the unbanked and under-banked comprise a majority of the population. Where we believe it makes sense, we will use partnerships or make acquisitions to accelerate our entry into new markets. During our 2006 fiscal year, we established, together with local investors, companies to create and implement UEPS systems in three African countries, Namibia, Botswana and Nigeria. Unlock Target Markets with a Key Product. The first step in establishing our system within a new province or country is to establish a broad base of smart card users around a single application. One of our preferred routes is to secure contracts to implement payment systems for government programs having large numbers of potential card holders. We believe another effective route will be the delivery of medical management applications, such as for HIV/AIDS. However, we are not dependent on government agencies to establish an initial base. Employers are widely examining our system to address their wage payment challenges and we are currently pursuing opportunities to deliver this solution. Similarly, banking institutions implement the UEPS banking application and distribute smart cards to their clients to replace ageing legacy systems, including paper or book- based systems. 5 Expand Our Products Within the Markets We Serve. With the establishment of a strong base of card holders and related infrastructure, we can then move to providing additional products and services. As part of broadening our card holders options, we will also sell our smart card readers and POS devices to merchants to enable them to enter into transactions. Additionally, we will work to establish relationships with post offices, banks and other financial service providers with the goal of making our system ubiquitous in the markets we serve. Provide Products and Services Ourselves Where the Profit Potential is Compelling. Our system can dramatically reduce transaction costs and improve data collection for a broad set of products and services. We intend to offer those products and services ourselves where the profit potential is significant. For instance, we engage in lending in South Africa. We are able to offer this service at a lower interest rate than competitors due to our ability to deduct interest and principal directly from a borrowers smart card and our knowledge of that individuals payment history. Establish Partnerships or Make Acquisitions When Appropriate. As part of our disciplined approach to growing our presence globally, we will evaluate and enter into partnerships where we can draw on local knowledge and infrastructure to drive the rapid adoption of our system. We believe that this will enable us to focus on our core strength in technology as well as product development and delivery. In some instances, we will make acquisitions where we believe that our approach will enable us to gain customers and realize operational benefits rapidly from the deployment of our more efficient solution. Our Technology We developed our technology to enable the affordable delivery of financial products and services to the worlds unbanked and under-banked people. Our proprietary technology is designed to provide the secure delivery of these products and services in the most under-developed or rural environments, even in those that have little or no communications infrastructure. Unlike a traditional credit or debit card where the operation of the account occurs on a centralized computer, each of our smart cards effectively operates as an individual bank account for all types of transactions. All transactions that take place through our system occur between two smart cards at the point of service, or POS, as all of the relevant information necessary to perform and record transactions reside on the smart cards. The transfer of money or other information can take place without any communication with a centralized computer since all validation, creation of audit records, encryption, decryption and authorization take place on, or are generated between, the smart cards themselves. Importantly, the cards are protected through the use of biometric fingerprint identification, which is designed to ensure the security of funds and card holder information. Transactions are generally settled by merchants and other commercial participants in the system by sending transaction data to a mainframe computer on a batch basis. Settlements can be performed online or offline. The mainframe computer provides a central database of transactions, creating a complete audit trail that enables us to replace lost smart cards while preserving the notional account balance, and to identify fraud. System Components Our platform consists of three fundamental components: (1) our FTS patent, (2) our UEPS and (3) our security protocol. FTS Patent. The FTS patent describes a method by which funds can be transferred from one smart card to another in a secure and offline manner. The term offline refers to transactions that are effected without the need to contact or communicate with the issuer when the transactions occur, as the smart cards themselves perform the authorizations required. The FTS patent also describes how smart cards can be loaded or re-loaded with funds and how these can be redeemed for value in either banking or non-banking environments. UEPS. Our UEPS is a suite of software programs that make use of the FTS methodology to deliver an integrated information, payment, switching and settlement environment that underpins our transaction processing system. Our software principally runs on three devices: the smart card, the POS device and the back-end system mainframe. When we sell a complete system to a customer or license our technology, we provide all of the software required to operate the UEPS, including the smart card functionality, the POS devices that allow our smart cards to transact with each other in an offline manner and our back-end system that primarily stores an audit trail of all transactions effected. The primary strengths of the UEPS are its affordability, security and flexibility. The system is affordable because the computer chips on the smart cards contain all the software necessary to process UEPS transactions, thereby allowing the POS devices required to conduct these transactions to contain far fewer components and less circuitry than traditional POS devices. There is also a reduced need for processing power and on-board memory given that online communication is not necessary. This eliminates the need for an internal or external modem and its associated hardware, maintenance and call costs. As a result, the 6 UEPS terminals are relatively inexpensive and do not require specialized technical expertise for installation. The UEPS also reduces or eliminates the need for national infrastructures, including electricity, telephone or data transmission. The UEPS is secure because the funds in each smart card are protected from illegal access through biometric fingerprint technology. In addition, every transaction is verified by the two smart cards involved in the transaction using state-of-the-art cryptographic systems in conjunction with protocols and techniques that we have developed. Finally, our UEPS is flexible because transactions are completed offline, eliminating virtually all restrictions where verified transactions can occur. We released the first version of our UEPS in 1991. It included software to operate each smart card as well as the main payment system. Later versions of our UEPS provided all of the functions necessary to issue and manage a smart card and terminal base as well as those needed to effect settlement between all of the operators and participants. Our UEPS is fully traceable and auditable. It can also provide advanced capabilities including loss tolerance and smart card-based interest distribution. Finally, our UEPS is scalable and capable of working in small applications including a hospital setting as well as large settings such as country-wide implementations. Security Protocol. Our security protocol was designed to prevent opportunistic fraud and enforce the correct transaction flow. The symmetric triple data encryption standard, or DES, is used extensively in association with a native random number generator that ensures that all transactions are performed by using a random session key pair. The DES encryption algorithm can be easily modified to use alternative symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithms such as the Rivest, Shamir and Adleman or elliptic curves. Each message exchanged during a transaction names both transacting parties, includes unique information to guarantee freshness and depends explicitly on all the messages that occur before it. 7 Our UEPS Platform The following diagram depicts how our UEPS platform is constructed. UEPS PLATFORM Fully-functional and integrated payment and settlement system, capable of operating all UEPS products and systems. COMPLETE SYSTEMS Combination of products meeting a clients particular requirements. STAND-ALONE PRODUCTS Financial transaction applications (S2S products). FUNCTIONALITY Combination of Hardware and Operating Systems on smart cards enable the creation of UEPS applications which can be customized for the particular needs of a client. OPERATING SYSTEMS Third-party software. UEPS software programmed by us. SMART CARDS (Hardware) Cards sourced from third-party vendors. HARDWARE POS devices, ATMs, back-end computer systems sourced from third-party vendors. 8 The UEPS we sell to clients is a platform with the potential to provide all of the products we develop which, when grouped together, form complete systems serving the specific needs of various business segments. Depending on the requirements of a particular customer, we assist the customer in the setup of its application which is tailored to provide only the products and services initially required, although the UEPS can later be updated to provide additional products. We outsource the manufacturing of the hardware components of our system, including smart cards, POS devices, automated teller machines, or ATMs, PCs and back-end mainframes. However, we have developed all of our application software modules so that they will run on different hardware platforms which allows us to be hardware-independent and to provide our customers with the latest and most economical hardware solutions. Scalability. Our UEPS can be implemented in different environments, from small closed systems to national implementations. In closed-system environments, the UEPS front-end equipment is personal computer-based and can therefore be implemented at relatively low cost. In these instances, we provide the back-end system on a transaction fee basis, thus limiting the overall set up cost. This approach can also be used whenever larger implementations are required but where the customer prefers to focus on marketing and selling its products rather than initially concentrating on operating the back-end system. The cost to entry can thus be greatly reduced as the operations can first become profitable before expending large amounts of capital. On the other hand, large governmental institutions, financial institutions or medical insurers typically prefer to maintain control over the entire payment system and therefore invest in a full system implementation. The time to launch these projects tends to be longer due to the time that is required to train the end-user to operate the system. Once a UEPS is installed on behalf of a customer, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from the scalability of the system as minimal changes are required to be made to the application base for the system to manage significantly greater numbers of users. We can therefore provide additional smart cards while leveraging the existing cost base in a market. In addition, we have a dedicated team of technicians and developers and an infrastructure capable of supporting a significant volume of customers and their transactions. As a result, we expect to benefit from economies of scale that pertain to increases in the number of products and services using the infrastructures we sell and/or implement. UEPS Smart Card Functionality We have combined these technologies to create a smart card application that incorporates and controls the functionality that is normally found on banking host systems. Our technology reverses the traditional approach where the card acts as an access mechanism to a host-managed account. Instead, the smart card controls the account itself while the host system is relegated to backing up and creating an audit trail for the smart card base. As a result, our technology provides extensive and flexible functionality through a system that is practical, secure and auditable. The following list itemizes some of the unique and critical functions provided by our smart card technology. Identification, Authentication, Non-Repudiation and Affirmation of UEPS Transactions. Traditional payment systems provide customers with paper receipts that reflect transaction details. Customers normally keep these receipts to reconcile their monthly account statements. During reconciliation, customers can detect fraudulent transactions and errors by matching account entries against their paper receipts, which may lead to disputes, financial losses and the repudiation of transactions. Fraud committed by people taking advantage of the inherent security weaknesses of traditional payment systems increases the cost of managing transactions effected through these systems. As a result, financial institutions and other system participants must invest significant resources to minimize the risk associated with fraud and errors. A fundamental element of the UEPS is that all payment and money transfer transactions take place between two UEPS smart cards  the smart card to be debited and the smart card to be credited. During the transfer of value between the two smart cards, the transaction is written to a dedicated history file on each of the smart cards. These history files are subsequently used to ensure settlement either directly or through the activation of the UEPS multiple streams audit trail feature. Thus, smart card holders can reconcile their monthly accounts directly from the smart cards transaction history file. Also, each smart card authorizes all debit transactions through the presentation and verification of one of the card holders biometric fingerprint templates that are stored in the smart card, and each UEPS transaction is signed by both smart cards. Taken together, these features of the UEPS help prevent the fraudulent creation, duplication or alteration of a transaction, as well as any potential repudiation of a transaction. As a result, the UEPS helps to minimize the costs associated with account management and inquiry resolution and helps ensure that customers do not incur losses from undetected errors, fraud or transaction mismanagement. Continuous Debit. People with limited economic means or unestablished credit histories may find it difficult to obtain access to public utility services such as telephone, fuel, water or electricity unless they purchase pre-paid units for these services. A prepaid unit of service may be a liter of fuel, a kiloliter of water, ten minutes of electricity or a two minute local phone call, and may 9 need to be used within a specified period of time before it expires. Pre-paying for services can deprive purchasers of flexibility to redeploy their funds to meet other financial needs. The continuous debit feature of the UEPS eliminates the need for customers to buy pre-paid units by allowing them to use their smart cards to pay for these services as and when they need and use them. All a customer needs to do is to insert his smart card into the utility equipment and the smart card will debit itself whenever a unit of service is used. The continuous debit feature provides significant financial flexibility to customers and can be tailored to be used in any pay as you go environment, including Internet access. Continuous debit transactions are typically a large number of small transactions that can quickly fill up the space on a smart cards transaction file. We eliminated this problem by designing the UEPS to minimize the file space that these transactions require by enabling subsequent transactions to replace and aggregate with earlier ones, thereby treating multiple transactions as one global transaction. Multiple and Restricted Wallets. Unbanked people who keep their cash at home risk the loss of their funds from misplacement, theft or disasters such as floods or fires, which can have a devastating impact on their financial lives. Keeping funds at home does not generate any interest income and cannot help demonstrate financial responsibility or provide collateral security for the extension of credit. Finally, keeping funds in cash can make it more difficult for people to segregate their funds for specific purposes, whereas having one or more bank accounts can facilitate budgeting for various categories of expenses. The multiple wallet feature allows card holders to use their smart cards to help manage their budgets. Up to 255 wallets can be configured and activated per card holder depending on the electrically erasable programmable read-only memory, or EEPROM, available on the particular smart card. Each of the wallets can be configured to meet the specific requirements of the card holder, and can be used for interest-generating savings, pre-paid utilities, medication management, credit, debit orders and for many other purposes. In addition, a wallet can be either protected or unprotected. Protected wallets require the biometric verification of the card holder to effect transactions. Unprotected wallets are normally used for low value transactions such as transportation for which speed of processing is critical. Since the audit trail of all transactions performed by the active wallets is stored on the smart cards history file, card holders can provide third parties with a comprehensive record of their transaction histories, which can help evidence payments, such as insurance premiums and demonstrate a regular income stream from wages or other sources. This audit trail can provide unbanked people the opportunity to obtain affordable services from formal financial service providers which might otherwise deny or limit services to them. Wallets can also be restricted. Restricted wallets allow transactions to be performed only at specific merchants. For example, if an employer desire to subsidize an employees transportation costs, a wallet can be configured that permits the holder to spend the value loaded into that wallet only at specified transportation points. Restricted wallets can also be used by governments to prevent social welfare grant recipients from using payment for particular goods or services. Offline Loading. The use of payment systems that depend on online authorizations is difficult to implement in developing economies and countries that do not have advanced or reliable telecommunication infrastructures. Online systems include magnetic stripe-based solutions that are widely used in first world economies and require that all transactions, including retail sales, the dispensing of cash, the loading of value to smart cards and the authorization of credit transactions, be performed only at self-service terminals, or SSTs, ATMs or POS devices that operate online. Thus, online systems cannot be used to provide financial or banking services to the millions of people, such as those in developing countries, that live in geographical areas that have little or no infrastructure. Most smart card systems therefore, such as EMV, also operate online. We believe that this reliance on online communication has limited the exploitation of smart card technology, has resulted in high system implementation and operational costs and has not addressed many of the needs of the worlds unbanked population. Our offline loading feature has been designed to solve these problems associated with reliance on limited infrastructures and allows value to be distributed through existing infrastructures such as the postal service, fixed line telephones, cellular phones, verbal communication and newspapers. Our solution is a unique ten-digit signature code that the UEPS back-end system generates to enable specific amounts to be loaded to specific smart cards. When a ten-digit signature code is presented at any offline POS device to the smart card for which it was created, the code will, after validation, allow the smart card to credit one or a number of its internal wallets in the appropriate amount. 10 The offline loading function can be used to transfer funds remotely for payments such as wages, pensions, welfare grants, refunds and third party transfers. When a number of ten-digit signature codes are created for a specific smart card, each ten-digit signature code can then only be applied to that smart card once. Ten-digit signature codes can be presented to a smart card in a different order from the one in which the codes were created but can be effected only by that particular smart card. Biometric Identification. The magnetic stripe credit and debit card systems available today use a written signature or a personal identification number, or PIN, in an effort to verify the customers identity minimize the repudiation of transactions. However, PINs can be compromised, magnetic stripes can be cloned and if a card is stolen together with its PIN number, the card can be used to transact until it is reported stolen or its offline limits are reached. The PIN and card can also be used to gain access to back-end account information to defraud further the genuine card holder. Therefore, positive offline card holder verification is critical to ensure that a payment system does not effect fraudulent transactions. At the same time, the system must ensure that the genuine card holders transactions are not rejected. As an alternative form of customer identification, the UEPS supports biometrics in the form of fingerprint recognition. Biometric scanners are used to record a customers fingerprint images. The fingerprint templates that result are stored in the holders smart card and used for identification whenever the smart card is used. Before a smart card is issued, the following fingerprint recordation process occurs: All ten fingers are captured, with three fingerprint images captured per finger. The three fingerprint images for each finger are consolidated and filtered to create the best image for that finger. This results in ten-high quality fingerprint images. The ten fingerprint images are scored and the four highest scoring images are used to generate fingerprint templates. A fingerprint template is a unique geometric representation of one fingerprint. The card holder is verified against these four templates using the highest fingerprint matching threshold to ensure the best recordation process. This process assists to eliminate the false rejection of genuine card holders due to initial bad fingerprint template recordation. The four fingerprint templates are signed by an issuing UEPS smart card and stored on the card holders smart card. When a transaction is performed, the card holders fingerprints are verified against those stored on the smart card. The verification process occurs in a secure session between the smart card and the fingerprint scanner. During the verification phase, a moderate matching threshold is used to compensate for the changes in the card holders fingerprint conditions. Our biometric identification feature is designed to protect our card holders against fraud, helps eliminate transaction repudiation and reduces the complexity associated with hot card management systems and hot line centers, as well as the cost of the systems that are utilized to deal with stolen and lost cards. Automatic Credit. The distribution of social welfare benefits, unemployment insurance, food parcels or vouchers and medical supplies is personnel intensive. Furthermore, beneficiaries must present themselves regularly at designated distribution locations in order to receive their benefits. These requirements create a number of operational and logistical problems, which increase the direct or indirect costs for system owners, operators and members, including: The costs of transporting beneficiaries and payment personnel to and from distribution points; The time beneficiaries must spend waiting in line at distribution points rather than working or engaging in other activities; The need to provide adequate staff, water, toilets, medical emergency services, shelters and security at distribution points; The need to provide personnel to deal with beneficiary communications and inquiries; and The need to create itineraries and schedules for payment delivery personnel, as well as to establish distribution centers and purchase vehicles to travel to distribution points. 11 Thus, governments incur significant costs in distributing social welfare payments at fixed or movable locations, and banking institutions must spend large sums to provide branches and ATMs where their customers can obtain cash. Many of these costs cannot be passed onto the client. We have developed the capacity in the UEPS to facilitate the distribution of cash at retail merchants in a manner that eliminates or reduces the need for social welfare beneficiaries and customers to travel to a specific ATM location, reduces merchants costs of depositing excess cash and that enables banks to reduce their costs associated with providing, maintaining and servicing brick and mortar infrastructures. We developed our automatic credit feature to allow our smart card holders to receive regular, fixed amount payments at POS devices that may not have the capability to perform online functions. The participants in an automatic credit transaction are the automatic credit initiator, the smart card holder and the merchant. The automatic credit initiator is the issuer which creates an automatic credit instruction for a particular wallet of a specific card holder. The smart card holder is the beneficiary of the automatic credit instruction which has been approved by the initiator. The merchant is any retailer which participates in the UEPS system and has a POS device for a card holder to activate automatic credit instructions. Card holders go to designated points to register for an automatic credit instruction. While at the POS device, the credit initiator submits an application for an automatic credit instruction to the back-end system. The application can occur offline or online. Once the back-end system has validated the beneficiarys information, it creates an automatic credit instruction signature which is sent back to the POS device and is then recorded on the smart card. On the day that the card holder is due to receive a payment, the card holder inserts his smart card into any POS device. In the event that the automatic credit instruction is due and valid, the smart card of the card holder is automatically loaded. Interest on Card. Unbanked people transact mainly with cash. One of the most fundamental disadvantages of cash is that it cannot generate interest income for the holder and that its value depreciates with inflation. The UEPS was designed, in essence, to be an alternative to a formal banking account that allows a smart card holder to earn interest on the value contained in his various wallets. The ability to earn interest provides an incentive for people to maintain balances on their smart cards rather than convert the full balances to cash or to unload them to a traditional banking account where they would not earn any interest. There are numerous possible types of interest calculations, including simple, compound, continuous, minimum balance, average balance, daily and monthly interest. The UEPS uses the compound interest methodology, calculated daily on the previous days closing balance. In order to calculate interest correctly, the client smart card requires a host date certificate, or HDC. This date originates from the back-end system, and is updated on the merchant smart card when it settles its transactions. The merchant smart card in turn passes the HDC to the card holders smart card, which enables the client smart card to calculate the interest for any wallet that bears interest. The system is designed to ensure that the client smart card only calculates the interest using the latest HDC, and not any date given to it from an unsettled or inactive merchant smart card. Once interest is added to an interest-bearing wallet, a notification record is written to the card holders smart card history file and forwarded to the merchant smart card for settlement. This record informs the back-end system of the interest amount credited. UEPS Morphing. The UEPS is proprietary. It is designed for a specific market that requires specific features and as such is not compliant or compatible with other smart card systems. If it were compatible with other systems, the usefulness of the UEPS would be as limited as these other systems and could not provide a solution for the unbanked populations of the world. However, we have designed the UEPS in such a way so that it can inter-operate with other standard payment systems such as EMV, one of the more widely-used standards in the banking sector. In the future, smart card holders may wish to use their smart cards in environments that are currently enabled for other smart card-based payment systems. The UEPS morphing feature allows our smart cards to transact at EMV POS devices as if our smart cards were in fact EMV smart cards. Our card holders can thus transact at EMV POS devices but the functionality provided at these POS devices is limited to that offered by the EMV system. Our smart cards, when required, can morph into the standards supported by the POS devices thus minimizing the cost of deploying another POS infrastructure. Our UEPS morphing feature is not merely a collection of multiple applications grouped together into a single smart card. This feature also enables inter-operability between these applications. The EMV standard is mainly an online application that requires offline card authentication, online host authorization and online card issuer authentication. The EMV payment application is invoked by the POS device using the application selection methodology. The UEPS smart card can recognize the type of environment in which it is used through the command structure passed to it from the ATM, SST, POS device or any other smart card reader conducting the transaction. Once the smart card has sensed the system in use, it immediately morphs this application and behaves as such for the duration of the transaction. The morphing feature is not limited to EMV, but can also be used with CEPS, Visa Horizon and Mondex, among other systems. It places the UEPS card holder in a unique position to possess a single smart card, and use it at any POS device, ATM or SST of his choice, without having to have different smart cards for every payment application. 12 Automatic Debit. Currently, payees experience various administrative problems and other challenges in collecting payments due to them through the formal banking system for insurance premiums, micro-loan payments and governmental statutory deductions for items such as unemployment insurance. In addition, collectors suffer payment losses as a result of insufficient funds, closed accounts, or charge back transactions, and may incur significant personnel costs for employees to attempt to collect from non-payors. Payees may find that their accounts are incorrectly debited, unauthorized debits are made or they pay high fees for debit orders which are not processed. For unbanked people, their problems are often even greater since their only means of payment is cash. To pay a premium, they have to present themselves at the office of the financial service provider and pay their premium in cash. These offices are typically in urban areas and therefore unbanked people have to pay for transportation in order to make their monthly payments. Carrying substantial amounts of cash over long distances involves risks of theft and loss. We created the automatic debit feature to allow a smart card to reduce the balance in any of its active wallets on a specific date and for a predetermined amount. This function can take place in an offline environment at any POS device. The automatic debit feature reduces the risks associated with collection of insurance premiums and other regularly scheduled payments by ensuring that any funds loaded to the smart card are first used to service the automatic debit before being transferred for the card holders general use. The participants in an automatic debit transaction are the automatic debit initiator, the merchant and the smart card holder. The automatic debit initiator is the issuer which will create an automatic debit instruction for a particular wallet of a specific smart card holder. The merchant is any retailer which is a participant in the system and has a POS device for a card holder to activate automatic debit instructions. The card holder is the person who must pay the premium or other payment. Card holders register for automatic debit instruction at the offices of the automatic debit initiator. While at the POS device, they submit an application for an automatic debit instruction to the back-end system. This can occur offline or online. Once the back-end system has validated the beneficiarys information, it creates an automatic debit instruction signature which is sent back to the POS device and is then recorded on the smart card. On the day that the card holder is due to pay a premium or other payment, the card holder inserts his smart card into any POS device. In the event that the automatic debit instruction is due, the smart card of the card holder is automatically debited. Multiple Streams Audit Trails for Offline UEPS Transactions. The UEPS, as an offline system, must ensure that all transactions effected offline are settled, at some point in time, by the back-end system. Settlement is critical to guarantee that no funds can be lost by card holders even when a POS device, its paper audit trail or its merchant smart card is lost, stolen or destroyed. Importantly, smart card transactions, including automatic credits, automatic debits, interest accruals, agent transfers, cash downloads and purchases, all have a financial effect on individual smart card balances and must therefore be settled in order to preserve system integrity. The UEPS multiple streams audit trail functionality is designed to ensure that the replacement smart card contains the correct amount of funds when a lost, stolen or defective card is replaced. The UEPS provides the ability to activate multiple streams audit trails through POS device profile downloading. Multiple streams audit trails are distributed through the active smart card base and are completely transparent to all card holders. Multiple streams audit trails can only be implemented on smart cards which have an adequate amount of EEPROM memory as the size of the transaction file created on smart cards will at least double. The multiple streams audit trails functionality is especially useful in environments where either the POS device is offline or may be damaged or destroyed due to the harsh environmental conditions in which it operates or where there is a perceived risk that the POS device may be stolen. When a client smart card is inserted into any POS device to perform one or more transactions, including a sale, load, unload, automatic credit, automatic debit or interest accrual transaction, the current transaction is written to both the client and the merchant smart cards. The previous transaction performed by the client smart card at another POS device is also written to the currently transacting merchant smart card transaction file as a piggy back record. The previous transaction or transaction group written to the merchant smart card from another client is also written to the client smart card of the currently transacting client. This process ensures that each transaction or transaction group effected on a client smart card is distributed directly to a second merchant smart card and indirectly to a third merchant smart card. The third transfer occurs by writing the transaction or transaction group to another client smart card which in turn transfers the same to a different merchant smart card. The number of different audit trails streams can be selected through the POS device or merchant profiles. 13 Upon settlement of the merchant smart card, the transactions which were performed at other merchants will therefore also be settled. Each merchant smart card becomes the carrier for transactions that have occurred at other merchants. All client smart cards become the multiple streams that facilitate the movement of transaction data among unrelated merchant smart cards. This process occurs in an offline environment. In the event of the loss or destruction of any POS device or its associated merchant smart card or paper audit trail, all transactions that have been piggy backed can be recovered through the settlement of other merchant smart cards. The speed at which these transactions can be recovered will depend on how frequently the client smart cards that are used to piggy back transactions have transacted at other UEPS merchants. The multiple streams audit trails functionality provides complete and independent audit trails that help prevent fraud by single or colluding parties. Transparent and Automatic Recovery for Offline UEPS Transactions. The UEPS, as an offline system, must ensure that all transactions effected offline complete successfully or that, in the event of a failure, the transaction in progress can be restarted without any loss being incurred by either the client or merchant concerned. Failure of the POS device or the premature removal of either of the smart cards involved during a transaction may lead to the client smart card being debited without the corresponding credit being reflected on the merchant smart card. Although the premature removal of either of the smart cards can be prevented by introducing motorized smart card readers, the cost involved is prohibitive and the solution does not address other possible failures due to POS device hardware problems or power failures, which are common in areas with unreliable power infrastructures. The UEPS is designed to recover failed transactions through its transparent and automatic recovery feature. This feature is activated during the session key establishment phase that occurs whenever two smart cards transact. During the session key establishment phase, each smart card generates an eight-byte natural random number and triple-DES encrypts it with its generic UEPS key pair. These two encrypted blocks are then exchanged by the two smart cards, and once decrypted, used by each smart card to generate a random DES key pair. This new key pair is used to exchange further information between the smart cards until the transaction is completed. During the next phase, each smart card passes to the other its smart card unique serial number and its current transaction counter. At this stage, the client smart card is now able to determine if the last transaction written to its transaction file was indeed also effected on the merchant smart card. If not, the client smart card simply unrolls its last transaction thus restoring the correct data image as it was prior to the transaction. This feature can also be used whenever a POS device is disabled for whatever reason. In this instance, the two smart cards can simply be inserted into any other working POS device and the two smart cards will automatically re-synchronize themselves. Further transaction processing can then resume normally. As a result of this feature, transactions such as transaction cancellation and reversals can be performed offline in a secure manner. Mechanics of Loading, Spending and Settlement The following describes how card holders can load value onto their smart cards and spend the value they receive. It also describes how merchants settle transactions with our back-end system. Loading. All card holders that receive social welfare grants or whose employers participate in our system can load their smart cards at any POS device located in merchant stores. Card holder can load their smart cards in several different ways. If the card holders electronic value was created through the ten-digit signature code, then the card holder has three options. He can effect an online auto load, in which case the POS device connects in real time to the back-end system, which then forwards any available ten-digit signature codes present in the account of the card holder. These codes will be loaded to the smart card automatically. If the communications network is erratic or unreliable, ten-digit signature codes can be downloaded to the POS device of a nearby participating merchant where and when the network is operational. The card holder can then perform an offline auto load whereby any ten-digit signature codes present in the POS device will be loaded to his smart card. If a network connection is not available, the card holder can key in his ten-digit signature code and amount to be loaded. In all scenarios the smart card will be credited only if the ten-digit signature code is decrypted successfully by the smart card. If the card holders smart card is initialized with one or a number of automatic credit instructions, the smart card will credit itself as we describe under Automatic Credit feature. Spending. Once value has been loaded to a smart card, card holders may purchase goods or services, make cash withdrawals, initiate money transfers, request automatic loans, effect third party payments and invoke automatic credits and debit orders, all offline at any participating merchant store. To perform a transaction, the card holder inserts his smart card into the top smart card reader of the POS device and selects the appropriate function. Biometric fingerprint identification is required for most functions to protect card holders against the unintended or fraudulent usage of their funds. A printed receipt displays the details of the transaction performed and includes other system audit trail information. 14 Settlement. As spending on a UEPS smart card occurs offline, the settlement of the merchant transactions with the back-end system needs to take place within the two day window settlement period provided for in the contract, or as and when the merchant smart card becomes full. Settlement can be performed online or offline. Merchants who have access to a network infrastructure can use the settlement option on their POS devices to connect to the back-end system and settle their merchant smart cards online. During the settlement process, merchants choose whether to have the funds settled deposited to a traditional bank account or transferred to a client smart card. Once the merchant selects the settlement option, the transactions are stripped off the merchant smart card, and the accumulated transaction values, less the transaction fees which the merchant is contractually required to pay to us, are paid to the merchant. Payment occurs either through the countrys traditional banking clearing system, by check or is credited to the merchants client smart card for immediate or future use. The last option is extremely beneficial for rural merchants who purchase their goods from larger wholesalers. Their funds are, upon settlement, immediately available. Therefore, they can purchase goods using their client smart card and/or withdraw cash at other participating merchants. Merchants who do not have access to a network infrastructure can insert their merchant smart card into any POS device that has online connectivity and perform the settlement process. Many merchants can share any POS device. If a merchant does not have access to a communication network, the merchant can use our milking function with a milking smart card. This smart card has greater functionality than a regular smart card and therefore requires a large memory chip for storing multiple transactions, hot card files, a freshness certificate, and any other variables, including fees and/or interest rates that need to be updated on merchant smart cards which operate in deep rural areas. The milking smart card is inserted in the bottom smart card reader of a POS device and the merchant inserts the merchant smart cards to be milked into the top smart card reader. During this settlement process, the transactions are stripped from the transaction history file of the merchant smart card and at the same time, the new hot card file, freshness certificate, fee structure, interest rates and any other parameter that requires modification are updated. The milking smart card is then physically handed over to the central office in order to update the back-end system. At the time of settlement, all transactions are stripped from the merchant smart card, aggregated and paid into the nominated bank account of the merchant. Merchants can select their client smart card as their nominated account, in which case the amount to be paid is added to the merchants client smart card. We have designed and developed a dual functionality smart card called the Net1 Combi-Card for use in rural environments and for very small merchant stores or hawkers. Hawkers are typically small merchants that sell food or merchandise from a stand on the side of road or on a pavement. This smart card is initialized with both merchant and client functionality. While trading, the merchant section of the smart card is used for transaction storage which once settled will allow the merchant to use the same smart card to perform purchases or any other financial function.

S2S Pension and Welfare S2S Pension and Welfare provides a secure and affordable transacting channel between social welfare grant beneficiaries, governmental agencies and formal businesses. Through this product, we distribute social welfare benefits to the unbanked and under-banked populations, and allow the recipients of these benefits to transact with formal businesses. How it works. We enroll social welfare grant beneficiaries by issuing them a UEPS smart card that digitally stores their biometric fingerprint templates on the smart card, enabling them to access their social welfare grants securely at any time or place. The smart card, with its pre-printed and unique serial number, or USN, is issued to the beneficiary on site. Optical fingerprint sensor technology identifies and verifies beneficiaries. The fingerprint reader is programmed to create a random cryptographic session between itself and an inserted smart card, thereby limiting the possibility of fraudulent storage and replay of digital templates. 17 The smart card provides the holder with access to all of the UEPS functionality, which includes the ability to have the smart card funded with wage, pension or welfare payments, make retail purchases, enjoy the convenience of pre-paid facilities and qualify for a range of affordable financial services, including insurance and short-term loans. The smart card also offers the card holder the ability to make debit order payments to a variety of third parties, including utility companies, schools and retail merchants, with which the holder maintains an account. The card holder can also use the smart card as a savings account. Depending on a countrys specific requirements, holders load their smart card using one of two methods  ten-digit signature code creation or automatic credit. We describe both of these methods under Our Technology  UEPS Smart Card Functionality  Offline Loading and  Automatic Credit. When the ten-digit signature code method is used, the government agency submits to us a simple payroll file containing the beneficiarys identity number and the value of the grant. We then process this file and, using the identification number of each beneficiary, create a ten-digit signature code. The ten-digit signature code can only be loaded on to the smart card for which it was created. These ten-digit signature codes can be distributed to the memory of POS devices or other compatible devices, including fixed or mobile ATM dispensers or remote personal computers, by accessing a communication network such as satellite, X.25, TCP/IP or GPRS-GSM. Thereafter, the beneficiary can load the smart card offline. If a GPRS  GSM communication network is available, the beneficiary can load the smart card online. The beneficiary simply inserts a smart card into the POS device and is prompted to present his fingerprint. If the fingerprint matches the one stored on the smart card, the smart card is loaded with the ten-digit signature code created for that particular smart card. The POS device then prints a receipt that outlines the amount of the grant paid to the beneficiary. The automatic credit feature allows a smart card holder to receive regular, fixed-amount payments such as welfare grants or other benefits, food parcels, meal vouchers and/or medical supplies at POS devices that operate offline. Automatic credit instructions are recorded on the smart card at the time they are granted by the issuer. Each automatic credit instruction recorded embodies a number of parameters such as the amount and the wallet to be credited, the frequency at which the credit should occur and the commencement and expiration date of the instruction. When the beneficiary inserts a smart card into a POS device or any other compatible device, the automatic credit feature will be automatically invoked. During this process, each automatic credit instruction previously recorded on the smart card will be reviewed. If all related parameters such as timing, commencement and expiration date are all correct the smart card is credited with the funds due. When this happens, the transaction is recorded immediately on the merchant smart card present in the POS device at the time that the beneficiarys smart card is credited. Since the electronic funds have been created offline, automatic credit transactions must be forwarded to the back-end system through a merchant settlement or through our multiple audit trail facility. We are able to claim the actual funds loaded to beneficiaries smart cards from the government agency at the end of each business day because the back-end system is informed of all of the electronic values created. Benefits. Our S2S Pension and Welfare system provides numerous benefits to governments agencies and beneficiaries. The system offers provincial governments a reliable service at a reasonable price. For beneficiaries, our smart card offers convenience, security, affordability and flexibility. They can avoid long waiting lines at payment locations and do not have to get to payment locations on scheduled payment dates to receive cash. They do not lose money if they lose their smart cards, since a lost smart card is replaceable and the biometric fingerprint identification technology helps prevent fraud. Their personal security risks are reduced since they do not have to safeguard their cash. Beneficiaries have access to affordable financial services, can save and earn interest on their smart cards and can perform money transfers to friends and relatives living in other provinces. Finally, beneficiaries pay no transaction charges to load their smart cards, perform balance inquiries, make purchases or downloads or effect monthly debit orders. For us, the system allows us to reduce our operating costs by reducing the amount of cash we have to transport. S2S Wage Payment S2S Wage Payment allows an employer to pay employee wages electronically, either online or offline, by transferring the precise amount of the wage payment directly onto a smart card, thus eliminating the need for the employer to store and handle cash at the workplace. We originally designed this product for unbanked and under-banked workforces and their employers. However, employers of employees who often have bank accounts have expressed interest in this product as well, which we attribute to its affordability, convenience and security. 18 How it works. Employees of participating employers receive smart cards which we issue to them. We download a ten-digit signature code for each employee wage payment to a POS device, and the employer takes the POS device to the pay site on payday. The employee inserts his smart card into the POS device which then searches for any ten-digit signature codes created for that particular smart card. Once the POS device locates and decrypts the ten-digit signature code, it immediately loads the smart card with the wage payment. The POS device prints a receipt which acts as a pay stub by including the amount of the wage paid and any deductions made. The receipt also indicates the balance of the savings wallet, if available. The process takes up to six seconds from insertion of the smart card to completion of printing. Personal identification through finger print authentication is not necessary to perform a load as the ten-digit signature code is uniquely linked to the USN number of the employees smart card. Benefits. S2S Wage Payment provides numerous benefits to employers and to employees. For employers, the system helps to increase productivity in the work environment and reduce administration and labor costs associated with the management, transportation, delivery and general handling of cash. Electronic payment requires less time than manual distribution of cash pay packets, thereby reducing the amount of employee downtime. Employers in rural and semi-rural areas no longer need to incur the inconvenience and expense of transporting their employees to urban areas to enable them to receive their wages from ATMs nor to have to advance funds whenever these ATMs run out of cash. In addition, the system is configurable for each employer so that the database can be split up into departmental or company sub-databases, if required. Further, employers of unbanked and under-banked employees are frequently put into a position of having to provide savings, loans, burial insurance and other financial services to their workers. With S2S wage payment, the employee can opt to have a portion of his wage loaded directly to a separate savings wallet on the smart card. Interest is calculated on the current daily balance and paid monthly to the card holder. The card holder can also qualify for an affordable loan, provided by us or another participating service provider, which is loaded onto his smart card. The smart card informs the back-end system of the monthly loan repayment which is applied against the wage after loading the amount due to the smart card. Finally, instead of the employer having to negotiate the most cost effective burial insurance for his employees, he can take advantage of the insurance we negotiate with selected insurance companies on behalf of many employers. The issuance of the insurance policy is recorded in the chip of the smart card. For employees, S2S wage payment offers all of the benefits described above under S2S Pension and Welfare. Additional benefits include fees for cash withdrawals that are typically lower than bank charges for the same transaction. S2S Cash Advance The S2S Cash Advance product will provide an issuer with the facility to offer small monthly cash advances to UEPS cardholders at UEPS POS terminals installed at participating merchants, bank branches and the offices of micro-financiers. The product allows the cardholder to receive a cash advance, calculated offline by the client's card, taking into account the monthly salary or wage income previously received by the card as well as any current deductions in respect of short or medium term loans. For example, when the next wage is paid on the card, the full amount of the previously granted cash advance plus associated finance charges will be automatically deducted and remitted to the financier. The card holder will then be in a position to qualify for a new cash advance as and when required. How it works. When a client presents his/her client card in the top slot of the POS device and the client selects the Cash Advance function on the POS device, the POS device will interrogate the client card for a previous Cash Advance that has not been repaid via debit order instructions. If a Cash Advance exists, this transaction will be denied. The POS device will prompt the client to select one of the Cash Advance options. The POS screen will display the Cash Advance option as well as the Cash Advance amount calculated. Once a Cash Advance has been granted and the client has been successfully biometrically verified, the client card will credit itself with the amount of the Cash Advance. Benefits. S2S Cash Advance has many benefits for card holders, merchants and financiers. For card holders, the system provides a cost effective and flexible method to apply for a Cash Advance at any registered merchant, bank branch or micro-financier that participates in the system. The system gives a card holder convenient access to credit as the credit check is performed by the client card itself in order to grant the Cash Advance, at an affordable low interest rate charged. Merchants benefit through the creation of a new revenue stream as they will be paid a fee for each Cash Advance loaded. Finally, the system benefits financiers as it provides a cost effective way of granting affordable Cash Advances without the cost of labor, stationary, infrastructure and administration. 19 S2S Loans to a Card The S2S Loans to a Card was designed for financiers to be able to participate in our SmartSwitch systems and utilize the UEPS technology to minimize the cash amount being paid out to their clients in respect of loans. Loans which are being made to cardholders can be loaded electronically on to their smart cards instead of dispensing cash. How it works. In order to participate in the system, the financiers will have to be registered onto the SmartSwitch system. A legal contract is completed between SmartSwitch and the Financier/ Merchant stating the specific hardware equipment requirements. Arrangements are made between SmartSwitch and the Financier/ Merchant for installation, implementation and training of the product. In order to perform offline loads to a client card, the first step will be to request the amount of electronic funds required for the days/weeks transfers to cards. The amount required plus a fee levied by SmartSwitch must be paid into a nominated bank account of SmartSwitch as stipulated in the merchant contract. If the fee is not included, the SmartSwitch system will automatically deduct the fee from the total funds requested. The merchant / financier will advise SmartSwitch as soon as funds have been transferred into the nominated bank account in the contract. The value will be credited to the financier / merchants instant bank account, or IBA, held on the back-end system and linked to the Merchant/Agent Card Reference Number. Using the POS device, the merchant will select the option to perform a funds load transaction for the value required. The POS will go online to the system host, access the funds available in the merchant IBA and load the merchants agent transfer card accordingly. When a loan is granted, the client card is inserted into the top reader of the POS device and the amount of the loan is transferred electronically from the merchant/agent card to the client card. A slip is printed verifying the amount of the loan loaded. The client can then perform a limited cash withdrawal if required and utilize the balance at merchant stores for spending and/or cash withdrawals. A sales transaction for the monthly repayment of the loan can be performed immediately, limiting the risks and costs involved in finding the client for repayment purposes or a third party deduction file will be forwarded to SmartSwitch. At the end of each business day, merchants will be required to settle their merchant agent cards to the SmartSwitch system host for reporting purposes. Benefits. The benefits of S2S Loans to a Card are multiple. The system reduces cash held at a lending branch as there is no need to dispense cash to the client in respect of a loan. The loan value is electronically loaded to the smart card. The risks associated with fraud and theft is minimized as there is no need to hold large amounts of cash on the premises. Instead of collecting cash, the monthly loan repayment can be performed electronically by performing a sales transaction using the same POS device or third party deduction. The result is a reduction in overall operating costs as security and insurance costs are reduced. The system also prevents the granting of fraudulent loans as biometric fingerprint verification is required from both the cardholder and the agent merchant card managing the loan. Finally, the merchant has easy access to a full audit trail of all electronic loans loaded from the merchant card to the cardholders card and detailed management reports are made available to the merchant on a daily and monthly basis. S2S Medical Management Our S2S Medical Management product applies the UEPS technology in a non-financial environment to facilitate the management, distribution and control of the anti-retroviral, or ARV, drugs used to combat HIV/AIDS. The system is designed to operate in the deepest rural areas where no meaningful infrastructure exists. It is also designed to form a basis for the implementation of other drug distribution programs. Governments and charitable organizations face many challenges in the distribution and control of ARV drugs. Patients who do not strictly adhere to the required drug regimen for the rest of their lives face the risk of drug resistance, which can lead to death. The toxicity of ARV drugs requires effective patient monitoring. Data needs to be collected to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs available for treatment. 20 How it works. We issue smart cards to participating hospitals, dispensaries and doctors and to their AIDS/HIV patients. The smart cards use biometric fingerprint identification technology and act as portable electronic medical record books that allow patients to be serviced anywhere without relying on centralized systems and communications networks. The smart cards carry all patient-related information, including personal details, drug regimens, prescriptions, visitation history, doctors details, dispensary information and other data. This data allows us to populate and update databases that track each patients progress, each doctors performance, each and every prescription dispensed and each dispensarys drug inventory levels. The system monitors patient activities, and is designed to ensure the integrity of data, reduce fraud, manage drug inventories and, control drug delivery, ensure patient anonymity and privacy, and distribute payment for goods and services. Each day, all registration information, changes to patient information, and information regarding drug dispensation is encrypted and communicated to our back-end system for batch processing. Once validated this information is forwarded directly to a confidential server managed by the government and/or funding organizations. Benefits. S2S Medical Management offers many benefits to government organizations, medical professionals and health care workers, and patients. For government organizations, the system helps save money by improving the efficiency of ARV drug distribution and by reducing the potential for fraud and falsification of data. For medical professionals and health care workers, the system facilitates the real time but offline registration of patients and the storage of crucial patient information, such as the patients last visit date, changes in information such as height and weight and the most recent prescription. For patients, the portability of the electronic medical record allows them to be treated anywhere, without relying on centralized systems and communications networks. The system, which is provided free of charge to the patient, is designed to ensure patient privacy. Finally, our technology preserves the patients information, even if the smart card is lost. S2S Retail and Wholesale Our S2S Retail and Wholesale product enables retailers, wholesalers and financial service providers to effect commercial transactions with one another and with unbanked and under-banked customers. Many merchants who service the unbanked and under-banked operate in underdeveloped areas where traditional financial institutions and their products are unavailable or limited due to the lack of communication infrastructures. In addition, these merchants do not meet the selection criteria imposed by financial service providers, including banks and credit card companies, either for financial reasons or because they cannot meet or adhere to the rules and regulations these formal institutions demand. The system permits participants, which include merchants, wholesalers and financial service providers to effect payments for goods and services, and to dispense cash from one smart card to another in a secure offline manner. The system is designed to eliminate unauthorized use by ensuring that all transactions are biometrically approved by the card holders. The system guarantees integrity by providing an audit trail for each transaction that is stored on both the customer and merchant smart cards. How it works. The participants in this system are merchants whom we enroll and consumers who are smart card holders. When we enroll a merchant, we issue a smart card to the merchant that contains its profile as well as the stores merchant reference number and install an appropriate POS device that takes into account the type of power and communications infrastructure available at the merchants location. The POS device is either battery-operated or uses a municipal power supply. All our POS devices can use GSM/GPRS, TCP/IP, X.25 or satellite networks to perform loading and settlement functions. The smart card is inserted in the bottom smart card reader of the POS device to perform on-line transactions with customers. We sign a contract with each merchant that is tailored to the needs of each merchant, reflecting the number of stores to be serviced and the specific hardware we agree to install. We provide each merchant with installation, system implementation and training. We also provide merchants with our marketing material for display at their locations so that their customers know that the merchant offers our services. The transactions stored on merchant smart cards cannot be overwritten until they have been settled by using our offline milking facility or connecting online to the back-end system. Benefits. S2S Retail and Wholesale provides numerous benefits to merchants and to customers. A growing smart card base offers merchants a larger number of customers who can shop in their stores. The system also provides them with the opportunity to realize new income streams from the fees they collect by providing at their locations our broad range of financial services and products, including cash downloads, money transfers, loans and burial insurance. Finally, their security risks and expenses associated with handling cash can be significantly reduced, including banking charges and communications costs. The benefits of the system for customers are a combination of the ones we describe above under S2S Pension and Welfare and S2S Wage Payment. 21 S2S Insurance Our S2S Insurance intermediary product enables unbanked and under-banked consumers to obtain affordable and reliable burial insurance policies. In South Africa, cultural reasons make burial insurance important to many people. Our system enables insurance companies to access this customer base. The insurance industry is subject to various laws and regulations which are designed to protect policyholders and our system ensures compliance with these laws and regulations by utilizing the key features of the UEPS technology. How it works. In order to participate in the system, card holders and insurance brokers must be enrolled in our system. The broker enrollment procedure is similar to the procedure we use for merchants. The insurance brokers merchant smart card is created centrally and loaded with the brokers burial insurance product options. Individual brokers receive smart cards which digitally store their biometric fingerprint templates on the smart card. After completion of the enrollment process, we issue an insurance merchant smart card to the insurance broker. We provide the insurance broker with installation, implementation and training. When an applicant applies for an insurance policy, the insurance broker explains relevant information, including the different policy options, waiting options and the 30-day cooling off period. The 30-day cooling off period allows the policy holder who has decided to buy a policy issued by another insurance company to change is mind and to keep the original policy instead. The system informs all parties involved, including the brokers for the previous insurer and the new insurer that the client is in a 30-day cooling off period. This makes the insurance broker of the previous insurer aware of the clients intention, and allows the insurance broker to contact the client in an effort to keep the client. When a broker sells a policy to a client, the first check performed by the smart card is to ascertain if the client has already signed up for a similar product, which may be accomplished offline. If not, the client accepts the new policy by presenting his fingerprint for verification by the smart card. The broker also presents his fingerprint to prove that he sold the policy and thereby allow him to receive his sales commission. The system then writes the policy number and details, including the amount of the premium, to the card holders smart card. This reduces the risk of future disputes regarding the policy. When an insured individual dies, the beneficiary presents the identity document, the insureds smart card and death certificate, and the original policy document. This information is checked against the information stored on the smart card by simply inserting the deceaseds smart card into a POS device and printing the data associated with burial policy information. If valid, the claim is paid out to the beneficiary immediately. Benefits. Our S2S Insurance intermediary product offers numerous benefits to insurance brokers and policyholders. For brokers, the system provides improved access to its potential client base, minimizes the risks associated with fraud through biometric fingerprint identification, facilitates legal compliance and provides a secure channel for collection of premiums. In addition, brokerage commissions can be managed through the system. The benefits for policyholders are generally the same as for customers as described above under S2S Retail and Wholesale. In addition, because the system reduces premium collection risk to the insurance company, it provides consumers with access to more affordable insurance products of a higher quality than would otherwise be available. Prism Products Prism has traditionally been a product-focused business. Our recent acquisition of Prism gives us access to the Prism product base, which we intend to integrate into our UEPS product and service offerings. The current main Prism products are: Chip and wireless Prism is a supplier of chip cards into the South African and other international markets. Prism works with mobile network operators, card manufacturers and semiconductor manufacturers to provide card technology, solutions and software that enable mobile telephony, mobile transactions and value-added services to take place in a trusted, secure and convenient manner. Prisms chip products and technology include operating system and application development, card manufacture and production, from concept and design through, printing, packaging and distribution. At the core of Prisms chip business is the strategy of licensing chip software to a wide spectrum of other industry participants. 22 Prisms Voucherless Top-Up, or VTU, solution facilitates mobile phone-based prepaid airtime vending. The VTU technology enables prepaid cell phone users to purchase additional airtime simply, securely and conveniently. The vendor uses its Global Systems for Mobile Communications, or GSM, handset to purchase bulk airtime from a mobile network operator. Airtime value, as opposed to a virtual voucher, is then transferred directly from the vendors cellular handset to that of the customer. When the vendor runs out of airtime value, it is a simple task to purchase more to resell to customers. Easypay Prism owns 74.9% of EasyPay (Proprietary) Limited, or EasyPay, which operates the largest bank-independent financial switch in Southern Africa. EasyPay focuses on the provision of high-volume, secure and convenient payment, prepayment and value-added services to the South African market.

Sales and Marketing We market our products and services primarily through our own sales and service organization which is headed by Brenda Stewart, our Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing. We have 41 employees in the Sales and Marketing division, who operate from our head-office in South Africa and from our regional offices in South Africa, Namibia and the USA. Our sales & marketing activities are currently focused on the sales of UEPS systems into the international market, with specific emphasis on Africa. We focus on identifying, defining and activating an entry point in a specific country to commence operations. Competition In addition to competition that we face from the use of cash, checks, credit and debit cards, existing payment systems and the providers of financial services, we have identified a number of other products currently being produced that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system and the companies that promote them. These include EMV, a system that is being promoted by Visa International Service Association, MasterCard International and Europay International; Mondex International Limited, a subsidiary of MasterCard; and Proton World International N.V., a subsidiary of STMicroelectronics Belgium N.V. In South Africa, and specifically in the payment of social welfare grants, our competitors also include AllPay Consolidated Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd., which is responsible for social welfare payments in the Free State, Gauteng and Western Cape provinces and a small portion of the Eastern Cape province, and Empilweni Payout Services, which is responsible for payments in the Mpumalanga province. 24 The incumbent South African retail banks operate a joint initiative to create a common banking product to offer to the significant portion of South Africas population that does not have access to traditional banking services, or the unbanked. This bank account, generally referred to as the Mzansi account, was introduced in October 2004 and offers limited transactional capabilities at reduced charges, when compared to the accounts traditionally offered by these banks. According to the FinScope 2005 survey 550,000 people (approximately 2% of the adult population) in South Africa claim to have an Mzanzi account, although the exact number of accounts is unknown. The social welfare beneficiaries who are currently paid through our smart card system may elect to use these accounts to receive their grants. We also may face competition from companies to which we have licensed rights to our technology, including Visa and BGS Smart Card Systems AG. Moreover, as our product offerings increase and gain market acceptance, banks in South Africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as infringing on their funds transfer businesses. Research and Development Our business activities and product offerings depend on our proprietary UEPS software. As a result, we have a large group of software engineers and developers who are constantly revising and improving the core UEPS software and its functionality. We believe that our smart card system is the most advanced system of its kind in the world today. However, we use a number of hardware platforms that are not proprietary to us and which are continuously being improved. These platforms include smart cards micro-controllers, POS devices, biometric readers and other back-end computer hardware. We continually work to take advantage of these improvements in our attempt to stay at the head of the competitive curve. A faster micro-controller on a smart card may allow us to process transactions faster and with more security. A larger memory smart card allows us to store more transactions and to load larger software applications. Larger memories also allow our smart cards to be used for more than one application at a time, thus eliminating the cost and the management of multiple smart card systems. Our smart card system is designed to manage tokens of value such as cash, credit, savings, medical history, identification criteria, finger print templates and insurance policies. Security is therefore of prime importance as any breach would result in the loss of our system integrity. This would be followed by a loss of confidence and credibility that would jeopardize our growth and market penetration. We therefore continue to advance our security protocols and algorithms to combat the potential attacks that have currently been identified. These include crypto- analysis techniques as well as reverse engineering. Attacks such as the latest differential power analysis, or DPA, must also be circumvented. We continue our research in new and more secure algorithms, such as the Rivest, Shamir and Adleman, or RSA, as well as new competitive asymmetric algorithms such as elliptic curves. We develop and implement these techniques ourselves and own the software that we create. Lastly, we continue to study the needs of our target market and develop new UEPS features that satisfy these needs. As our UEPS system is implemented in more and more developing countries, we create greater connectivity between our systems to subsequently activate international transactions and cross-border money transfers. Intellectual Property Our success depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain a competitive intellectual property advantage over potential competitors in the electronic financial services industry. We believe that we have developed the first payment system based on technology that is protected by our FTS patents. We rely on know-how, including trade secrets and other confidential information, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to further develop our proprietary position. Our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain intellectual property protection for the UEPS technology and related processes, including any improvements to and developments of them, to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our intellectual property rights will be important factors to our success. 25 The FTS patents, which include aspects of the UEPS technology, have been issued in the United States, Hong Kong, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland. The FTS patent in the United States was granted as U.S. Patent No. 5,175,416 on December 29, 1992. The patent was reissued as U.S. Patent No. RE36,788 on July 25, 2000, and will expire on May 17, 2011. It currently remains in full force and effect, and we are not aware of any challenges to its enforceability. The FTS patent in Hong Kong was granted on December 11, 1998, and will expire in 2010. The Hong Kong FTS patent is jointly owned by us and the estate of a co-inventor. The FTS patents in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland were granted on September 25, 1991, March 9, 1993, April 7, 1993 and December 9, 1992, respectively. These patents remain in full force and effect, and we are not aware of any challenges to their enforceability. The FTS patent will expire in 2007 in Namibia and in 2009 in South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland. A European FTS patent was filed in October 1990 and granted in December 1994. The European Patent Convention provides for an opposition period of nine months following the grant of a European patent, and six parties filed an opposition to the grant of the FTS patent. The case was heard before a Board of the Opposition Division in March 1998 and the patent was upheld. Following this decision, a number of the original opponents filed an appeal. The oral proceedings for the appeal were heard on October 10, 2002 and the Appeal Board reversed the earlier decision. The formal written decision from the Appeal Board was received on December 24, 2002. Consequently, the European patent has been revoked and there is no possibility of any further appeal. As a result of this ruling, BGS, the local system operator in the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, has stopped paying us any patent royalties. However, our business plan and forecast do not account for such royalties as a source of revenue in the medium to long-term, as the key to our operations in Europe is based on our know-how and ability to exploit the technology rather than on the European patent. Accordingly, we do not expect this ruling to have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Aspects of the UEPS technology are described in U.S. Patent No. RE36,788. This patent, entitled Funds Transfer System, is directed to a method of transferring funds between financial institutions via a smart card. In particular, the method includes linking a smart card (first device) to a first financial institution, debiting an account held at the financial institution and recording a corresponding credit value in the smart card. The smart card is then linked to a second, similar device, wherein the credit value in the smart card is reduced and a corresponding credit value is recorded in the second device. The second device is then linked to a second financial institution, wherein the credit value in the second device is reduced and a corresponding credit value is recorded in an account held at the second financial institution. The smart card and the second device each store at least a portion of a program which is run in a synchronized interactive manner between the devices. In 1997, we entered into a technology license agreement with Visa International Service Association, or Visa. Under that agreement, Visa purchased a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide license to our technology rights that are defined in the agreement to mean all our then-current worldwide patent rights, copyrights, mask work rights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights relating to our UEPS technology. This Visa license includes an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide license under our patents, as defined in the agreement, licensed to Visa that is exclusive to the financial services industry, as defined in the agreement. The agreement defines patents as meaning our current worldwide patents and patent rights, including U.S. Patent No. 5,171,416, including without limitation, enhancements, improvements and expansions to all of the licensed patents and any foreign patent applications corresponding to any patent associated with any of our products or services that use technology related to financial services or can be used in the financial services industry. The agreement defines financial services industry as persons or companies that are directly or indirectly making loans; taking deposits; selling, brokering, or factoring securities, insurance, mortgages or receivables; and providing payment services, such as issuing charge cards, credit cards, payment cards, debit cards or any other system that could compete with such payment methods. Our Visa agreement grants back to us the non-exclusive right under our Visa-licensed patents to make, use and sell our payment systems and other products in the financial services industry as defined in the agreement. In our Visa agreement, Visa agrees not to grant a sublicense to any payment system to any entities in the financial services industry who are not members of Visa already if such entity already has a right to use such payment systems from us. The agreement permits Visa to sublicense our licensed technology rights to any of its member, any entity in the financial services industry or any entity outside of the financial services industry that provides products to Visa or its sublicensees. The agreement prohibits us from licensing our technology rights, not just our licensed patents, to any of Visas competitors, including MasterCard, Europay, American Express Company, Discover Financial Services, Diners Club International Credit Card Co., Carte Blanche Card or JCB International Credit Card Co. or any of their parents, subsidiaries or affiliates. We have also licensed our foreign FTS patents in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland to Visa, Nedbank and First National Bank of South Africa. 26 The patent position of companies like ours is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. The FTS patents and related patents that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing our product or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our processes. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Because of the extensive time required for development and testing of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. We hold trademarks in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland and France. We own the exclusive copyrights in the current version of the UEPS programs, subject to any copyrights in preexisting materials in earlier versions of the UEPS programs that are jointly owned by us and other parties under various agreements. Effective October 1, 1990, we entered into an agreement with Metrolink (Proprietary) Limited, a Nedbank subsidiary, assigning Metrolink the then-current copyrights in the UEPS programs with respect to South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Under this agreement with Metrolink, we retained the worldwide copyright rights in the UEPS programs outside of the seven listed countries, and acquired the worldwide copyright rights in the Metrolink system (later known as the Megalink system) for all countries outside of the same seven listed countries. In July 1997, we confirmed our joint ownership with Nedbank of the copyright ownership in the then-current UEPS programs on a worldwide basis and agreed with Nedbank that neither Nedbank nor we had any obligation to share with each other any income or other monies either of us derived from the UEPS software. Then, on July 11, 2000, we agreed again by written agreement with Nedbank that all copyrights in the then-current UEPS programs as of June 2000 would be jointly owned by Nedbank and us. Since July 2000, there have been no further agreements respecting copyright ownership in the UEPS programs. We are the sole copyright owner of all original material in the UEPS programs developed by us since July 2000. Financial Information about Geographical Areas and Operating Segments For each of the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004, we derived substantially all of our revenues from customers located in South Africa and substantially all of our assets were located in South Africa. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our operating segments. Employees As of June 30, 2006, we had 1,763 employees. On a segmental basis, 190 employees were part of our management, 1,230 were employed in transaction-based activities, 199 were employed in financial services and 144 were employed in smart card, hardware, software and related technology sales and corporate activities. On a functional basis, six of our employees were part of executive management, 41 were employed in sales and marketing, 84 were employed in finance and administration, 114 were employed in information technology and 1,518 were employed in operations. As of June 30, 2006, 183 of 289, or 63.3%, of our employees in the Limpopo Province who were performing transaction-based activities were members of the South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union, or SACCAWU. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees and SACCAWU. As of July 3, 2006, Prism had 295 employees which increases our number of employees to 2058. 27 Corporate history Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in Florida in May 1997. Until June 7, 2004, Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. was a development stage company and its business consisted only of acquiring a license to the U.S. FTS patent and obtaining an exclusive marketing agreement for the universal electronic payment system, or UEPS, technology outside South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Swaziland. On June 7, 2004, through a newly-formed subsidiary, Net 1 Applied Technologies South Africa Limited, or New Aplitec, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed all of the liabilities of Net 1 Applied Technologies Holdings Limited, or Aplitec, a public company listed on the JSE Securities Exchange South Africa. Aplitec owned the FTS patent in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Swaziland and one of its subsidiaries was the other party to the marketing agreement described above. The primary purpose of the Aplitec transaction was to consolidate into one company the intellectual property rights relating to the FTS patent and the UEPS technology, to establish a first-mover advantage in developing economies for the commercialization of the UEPS technology, and to exploit market opportunities for growth through strategic alliances and acquisitions. In the Aplitec transaction, the former shareholders of Aplitec obtained a majority voting interest in Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. Generally accepted accounting principles require that the company whose shareholders retain a majority interest in a combined business be treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Consequently, this transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition. The Aplitec transaction is described in more detail below. Between 1998 and 2000, Aplitec made three strategic acquisitions for the purpose of building a critical mass of smart card users. In May 1998, Aplitec acquired Net1 Southern Africa (Proprietary) Limited, a supplier of smart cards and terminals which serviced the POS terminal network of Nedbank Limited, or Nedbank, a major South African banking group. This transaction allowed us to develop a relationship with Nedbank. In 1999, Aplitec acquired Cash Paymaster Services (Proprietary) Limited, or CPS, a company engaged in the distribution of social welfare grants on behalf of several of the provincial governments of South Africa. This transaction enabled Aplitec to convert CPSs customer base of approximately 1.5 million people from a cash distribution system to a smart card-based system, and to acquire a logistics and implementation infrastructure. Aplitec began converting grant beneficiaries shortly after the acquisition. Conversion has allowed us to eliminate a portion of the costs we incur in connection with the distribution of cash, and thus to reduce our operating costs. The conversion has also provided us with the opportunity to sell products and services to these same customers. During the course of 1999 and 2000, Aplitec acquired Moneyline (Proprietary) Limited and New World Finance (Proprietary) Limited, each of which was engaged in the microlending business. Microlending involves extending cash loans for periods ranging from 30 days to several months. Aplitec made these acquisitions primarily for the purpose of gaining exposure to an additional base of potential smart card users in order to deploy its microlending administration and payment products. We have actively engaged in converting traditional microlending customers to UEPS-based lending, which has also helped us improve the profit margins on our lending business by reducing the expenses associated with non-collection of traditional loans. After completing these three acquisitions, we sought to create an infrastructure of point of sale, or POS, terminals that would permit businesses and merchants to engage in smart card transactions with their card holder base. In June 2004, we implemented a merchant rollout in the Northern Cape province of South Africa, supplying merchants with smart cards and POS terminals in order to permit smart card holders to transact with one another. With the increasing opportunity to conduct transactions using smart cards, by June 30, 2004, approximately 60% of welfare and pension beneficiaries in the Northern Cape province had kept value on their cards on at least one occasion rather than immediately converting their entire payments to cash. With the subsequent rollout of terminals at selected merchants in other provinces of South Africa, more beneficiaries have started using their smart cards for transacting with merchants. At the same time that we were building the UEPS infrastructure and distributing our smart cards, we were also seeking to expand the range of products and services available to smart card holders. In 2001, we developed a suite of financial services targeted at social welfare beneficiaries, utilizing our issued base of smart cards as a delivery channel. We currently have approximately 78,000 customers in these two provinces, to whom we make loans on which we earn interest and to whom we sell insurance policies on behalf of insurers for which we collect both a commission for the sale of a policy and a fee for the monthly premium deduction. According to research by the FinMark Trust, 29% of all South Africans have a form of burial saving or insurance policy, but the collection of policy premiums remains a problem for insurance companies due to the limited penetration of bank accounts. However, using the UEPS technology allows automatic deduction of premiums from a persons smart card at pre-designated times. Going forward, we plan to grow and develop this business under different brands by launching new products and by introducing the service to social welfare beneficiaries in the other provinces where we administer social welfare grants and to employees utilizing our wage payment system. 28 We have also begun to expand our business into other countries. Our technology is operated by third parties in Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Rwanda, Burundi and Latvia. We are currently at different stages of establishing UEPS card holder bases and POS device infrastructures with partners in Nigeria, Namibia and Botswana. Our preferred approach to enter a new country or market is to identify an entry point for our products and services that will result in rapid acceptance by a new card holder base. At the same time, we also identify suitable partners who exhibit one or more of the following qualities: access to a client base that has a need for our products and services; ability to fund a proportion of the capital expenditures and operating costs required to establish a new venture; or expert knowledge of the culture, political and economic dynamics of the country or market they operate in. We then incorporate an appropriate corporate entity, usually under the name SmartSwitch (if available) with the shareholding proportions determined by the funding committed by ourselves and our partners. We enter into shareholder agreements with our partners and service level agreements with our clients prior to the commencement of activities. When all the shareholders have transferred their respective capital contributions through a combination of capital and loan contributions, as determined in the shareholders agreements, we appoint a local management team in collaboration with our partners and commence with the establishment of the infrastructure required to operate a UEPS system. This process generally takes three to six months, depending on the size of the system required and the number of products and services that will be initially introduced. We sell the core UEPS system, as well as related hardware, customization and training to the corporate entity on normal commercial terms. The management team of the corporate entity is responsible for the initial implementation, the daily operations of the business and the continued growth of the venture through the introduction of new products and services, as the card holder base expands. Depending on the nature and size of our shareholding, we either consolidate or equity account the results of these corporate entities. On June 7, 2004, we acquired the business of Aplitec for a purchase price of approximately $127.5 million. Under the exchange control regulations of SARB, South African reinvesting shareholders were not permitted to hold our securities directly. Therefore, in order to comply with these regulations, these reinvesting shareholders received, through an interest in a South African trust, securities of New Aplitec, consisting of B class loan accounts and B class preference shares. The A class loan accounts and A class preference shares of New Aplitec are held by Net1. These reinvesting holders also obtained the right to receive, for no additional consideration, shares of our special convertible preferred stock which are held by a Cayman Islands trust. We refer to the B class loan accounts, B class preference shares and special convertible preferred stock that we and New Aplitec issued in the transaction as the linked units. The special convertible preferred stock is convertible on a one-for-one basis into our common stock upon the occurrence of a trigger event, and holders are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis. Upon conversion of the special convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of a trigger event, the linked unit holder cedes to Net1 the B class loan accounts and B class preference shares that were part of the linked unit. A trigger event includes any of the following: (1) giving of a conversion notice by a linked unit holder, (2) the abolition or relaxation of SARBs exchange control regulations or (3) the liquidation of New Aplitec or Net1. We describe our special convertible preferred stock and the New Aplitec B class loans and B class preference shares in more detail in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with the Aplitec transaction, the total number of our pre-reverse stock split outstanding shares of capital stock increased from 15.9 million shares prior to the transaction to 328.2 million after the transaction. Of these 328.2 million shares, we issued 193.0 million shares of our special convertible preferred stock. Our special convertible preferred stock is structured so as to be economically equivalent to common stock and has substantially the same rights as our common stock. During the period from the completion of the Aplitec transaction through June 30, 2006, an aggregate of 24,846,091 shares of special convertible preferred stock were converted into an equal number of shares of common stock, and the number of outstanding shares of special convertible preferred stock was correspondingly reduced. In July 2006, we acquired Prism Holdings Limited, a South African public company which focuses on the development and provision of secure transaction technology, solutions and services. We describe the acquisition in more detail in Item 7Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverview--Prism Acquisition. 29 Available information We maintain an Internet website at www.net1ueps.com.

RISK FACTORS INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS FORM 10-K, BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCURS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD SUFFER. IF THIS HAPPENS, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WOULD LIKELY DECLINE AND YOU MIGHT LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK. The South African Social Security Agency, or SASSA, is expected to begin, in the near future the process of conducting a national tender for the award of contracts to distribute social welfare grants. If we were not to receive contracts to continue to distribute these grants in each of the provinces where we currently distribute them, or if we do win these contracts, but the terms are not as favorable to us as our current contracts, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. We currently derive a majority of our revenues from contracts to distribute social welfare grants on behalf of five of the nine provincial governments of South Africa. For the foreseeable future, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows will depend on this concentrated group of customers. During the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we derived approximately 77%, 79% and 82%, respectively, of our revenues from payments made to us by these provinces under our government social welfare contracts. The South African national government created SASSA in 2004 to consolidate at the central government level the administration of social welfare grants. SASSA has recently begun the process of conducting a national tender for the distribution of social welfare grants in which bidders will have the opportunity to bid for all of South African or on a province-by-province basis. In late July 2006, SASSA published a request for pre-qualification of bidders, or RFQ which included a proposed timetable for pre-qualifying bidders, distributing requests for proposals, or RFPs, from pre-qualified bidders and evaluating RFP submissions, indicating that the process should be completed by late November 2006. However, in mid-August 2006, SASSA withdrew the RFQ. SASSA did not indicate when it would re-publish the RFQ or otherwise recommence the tender process. Once SASSA recommences the tender process, there can be no assurance that the tender will result in our receiving contracts to continue to distribute social welfare grants in each of the five South African provinces where we currently distribute them. Even if we do receive new contracts, we cannot predict the terms that such contracts will contain. Any new contract we receive may contain pricing or other terms, such as provisions relating to early termination, that are not as favorable to us as the contracts under which we currently operate. The time and attention required by our management in connection with the tender process and the uncertainty surrounding the tender process may have a disruptive effect on our business. In addition, although we believe that our existing contracts will be extended if the tender process is not completed on time, there can be no assurance whether such extensions will in fact occur, or if they do, what the length or terms of such extensions will be. Moreover, because we incur a significant portion of the expenses associated with these contracts during the initial implementation phase, we have historically enjoyed higher profit margins on these contracts after the completion of the implementation period, which averages approximately 18 months. Therefore, to the extent that we are not successful in obtaining new provincial contracts, or if a new contract were to be terminated for any reason during the implementation period, our profit margins would also be adversely affected. Finally, if we were to be awarded one or more contracts by SASSA, an unsuccessful tenderor could seek to challenge the award, which could result in the contract being set aside or could require us to expend time and resources in an attempt to defeat any such challenge. For example, the November 2002 award to us of the Limpopo provincial contract, which was executed in 2003,was challenged by a disqualified bidder for the contract. A South African court set aside the contract in 2005, although the courts ruling was suspended and the contract was reinstated as a result of an appeal of the ruling by the province. Nevertheless, the court challenge created uncertainty, consumed management time and attention and required us to incur substantial legal expenses. 32 Our strategy of partnering with companies outside South Africa may not be successful. In order for us to expand our operations into foreign markets, it may be necessary for us to establish partnering arrangements with companies outside South Africa. During fiscal 2006, we established three such partnerships in Namibia, Botswana and Nigeria, and we are currently exploring a number of other opportunities to implement UEPS systems and to participate as an investor in these projects. The success of these endeavors is, however, subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control, such as finding suitable partners with the appropriate financial, business and technical backing and continued governmental support for planned implementations. In some countries, finding suitable partners and obtaining the appropriate support from the government involved may take a number of years before we can commence implementation. Some of these partnering arrangements may take the form of joint ventures in which we receive a minority interest. Minority ownership carries with it numerous risks, including dependence on partners to provide knowledge of local market conditions and to facilitate the acquisition of any necessary licenses and permits, as well as the inability to control the joint venture vehicle and to direct its policies and strategies. Such a lack of control could result in the loss of all or part of our investment in such entities. In addition, our foreign partners may have different business methods and customs which may be unfamiliar to us and with which we disagree. Our joint venture partners may not be able to implement our business model in new areas as efficiently and quickly as we have been able to do in South Africa. Furthermore, limitations imposed on New Aplitec by South African exchange control regulations, as well as limitations imposed on us by the Investment Company Act of 1940, may limit our ability to establish partnerships or entities in which we do not obtain a controlling interest. In addition, certain of our licensees, including BGS and Visa, have become our competitors and this could occur with our joint venture partners in the future. We have lost license fees in the CIS as a result of a dispute with BGS, the local system operator, which claims that the revocation of the European FTS patent relieves it from the obligation to pay us licensee fees. We believe that the licensing fees due from BGS relate to its use of our UEPS technology rather than the FTS patent and, therefore, we are currently evaluating our options on this matter. We will face integration and other challenges associated with our recent acquisition of Prism On July 3, 2006, we completed the Prism acquisition. Integration of Prisms business operations into our own will pose several challenges for us. We expect that the integration will require significant management time and attention and may disrupt our existing businesses by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the geographical distances between South Africa and some of Prisms operations which are located on other continents. We will face challenges associated with integrating different corporate cultures and personnel with disparate business backgrounds. We may also not be able to maintain Prisms key employees or customers or to realize some or all of the cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when we agreed to acquire Prism. In addition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings. We may also have liabilities or experience adverse operating issues that we may have failed to discover during due diligence prior to the acquisition. As we have only recently completed the Prism acquisition, we may not have fully identified all of the risks or other issues that could adversely affect us as a result of the acquisition. We may not maintain our current level of profitability or rates of growth. We believe that our continued profitability and growth will depend in large part on our ability to do the following: - continue to enroll new smart card users and participating merchants in South Africa; - achieve growth in the number and value of transactions processed using our smart cards; - expand our business internationally by properly identifying new markets and business partners for those markets; - hire and train personnel capable of marketing, installing and integrating our solution, supporting customers and managing operations; - continue to expand the range of applications that use our technology and to market these applications successfully; and - manage the costs of our business, including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our technology and expanding our operations internationally. If we are not able to achieve any or all of the above, our profitability and/or growth rate will likely decline. 33 Changes in current government regulations relating to social welfare grants could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows. We derive a substantial portion of our current business from the distribution of social welfare grants onto smart cards in South Africa and the transaction fees resulting from use of these smart cards. Because social welfare eligibility and grant amounts are regulated by the government, any changes to or reinterpretations of the government regulations relating to social welfare may result in the non-renewal or reduction of grants for certain individuals, or a determination that currently eligible social welfare grant recipients are no longer eligible. If any of these changes were to occur, the number of smart cards in use could decrease, the amount of money on any particular smart card could decrease or the amount of transactions effected on any particular smart card may decrease, all of which could result in a reduction of our revenues and cash flows. We may have difficulty managing our growth which could limit our ability to increase sales and cash flow. We have recently been experiencing significant growth, both in the scope of our operations and size of our organization. This growth is placing significant demands on our management, as well as on our operational resources. In order to achieve our business objectives, however, we anticipate that we will need this growth to continue. Continued growth would increase the challenges involved in: - implementing appropriate operational and financial systems; - expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure and capabilities; - providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards; and - preserving our culture and values. Additionally, continued growth will place significant additional demands on our management and our financial and operational resources, and will require that we continue to develop and improve our operational, financial and other internal controls. If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, we will not experience our projected growth and our financial results may suffer. There are risks relating to operating in South Africa that could adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. Our primary operations are located in South Africa and we currently generate substantially all of our revenues from our operations in South Africa. As a result, we are subject to any political, economic and regulatory uncertainties in South Africa. The changing political and social environment. South Africa faces certain social, political and economic challenges, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The country is experiencing high levels of unemployment and there are significant differences in the level of economic and social development among its people, with large parts of the population, particularly in the rural areas, having limited access to education, healthcare, housing and other basic services. Furthermore, South Africa faces challenges in building adequate infrastructure. These problems, together with a shortage of skilled labor, may in the future have an adverse impact on productivity. Inflation and interest rates. The economy of South Africa is currently characterized by low inflation and interest rates. As of May 2006, the inflation rate was approximately 3.9% . The Reserve Banks base lending rate is currently approximately 8.0% per annum. However, the economy of South Africa in the past has been, and in the future may be, characterized by high rates of inflation and high interest rates. High rates of inflation could increase our South African-based costs and decrease our operating margins. High interest rates could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective debt financing in South Africa. 34 Regulatory uncertainty regarding black economic empowerment. The South African government, over the past five years, has been developing an economic indigenization program referred to as black economic empowerment, or BEE. BEE is regulated pursuant to an Act of the South African Parliament, namely the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act 53 of 2003, or the BBBEE Act. The BBBEE Act recognizes two distinct mechanisms for the achievement of BEE objectives: (1) codes of good practice issued under the Act and (2) sectoral transformation charters developed by specific industry sectors and which may be recognized by the Minister of Trade and Industry if they have been developed by the major stakeholders in the relevant industry and advance the objectives of the BBBEE Act. Draft codes of good practice have recently been published for public comment, but none of them is, as yet, enforceable. The information and communication technology sector, or ICT sector, and the financial services sector have both developed sectoral transformation charters, but they have not yet been published in the Government Gazette and, consequently, they do not currently enjoy any formal status. The ICT sector has attempted to ensure as great a degree of comparability between its sectoral transformation charter and the draft codes of good practice, thereby assuring the probable publication of that charter in the Government Gazette by the Minister of Trade and Industry. By contrast, there are no indications that the financial services sector has made any attempt to achieve significant alignment between its transformation charter and the draft codes of good practice. Once the codes of good practice become law, all businesses in South Africa will be subject to those codes unless they form part of a sector in respect of which the Minister of Trade and Industry has published an industry charter in the Government Gazette as a code of good practice. The current uncertainty as to the final form of the regulatory regime poses a risk, but there are indications that the regime will be settled in the next 12 months. We are likely to be subject to the ICT sectors charter if this document is published in the Government Gazette as a code of good practice. This charter applies, among others, to companies that manufacture equipment for, or provide services relating to, the electronic capturing, transmission and display of data and information. Compliance with the charter is not enforced through civil or criminal sanction, but only through its effect on the ability to secure contracts in the public and private sectors. One of the components of BEE is that a certain percentage of ownership by black South Africans or historically disadvantaged South Africans of our South African business should be achieved over a period of time which is generally thought to be ten to 15 years. Although BEE is not expropriatory in nature, there may be a dilutive effect to current shareholders in the South African business and there may be a cost associated with increasing the level of black shareholders or historically disadvantaged South Africans, both of which factors may represent a risk. However, given that non-BEE compliance may place in jeopardy existing and future South African public and private sector contracts, the loss of which could cause a loss of revenue, the attendant risk associated with BEE non-compliance is material. Exchange control regulation. South Africas exchange control regulations restrict the export of capital from South Africa, the Republic of Namibia and the Kingdoms of Lesotho and Swaziland, known collectively as the Common Monetary Area. Transactions between South African residents, including companies, and non-residents of the Common Monetary Area are subject to exchange controls enforced by SARB. In October 2004, the South African exchange control regulations were liberalized by the abolishment of exchange control limits on new investments outside of South Africa by South African companies. However, according to the circular giving notice of this liberalization, SARB retains an oversight function, the exact nature of which is not entirely clear from the circular. According to the circular, South African companies investing outside of South Africa must now apply to SARB only for monitoring purposes and for the approval of SARB pursuant to existing foreign direct investment criteria, including demonstrated benefit to South Africa. SARB reserves the right to stagger capital outflows relating to very large investments outside of South Africa by South African companies, so as to manage any potential impact on the foreign exchange market. Also, these liberalization measures permit South African companies to retain, outside of South Africa, dividends received in relation to shares held by them in non-South African companies. South African exchange controls are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. The South African government, however, has committed itself to gradually relaxing exchange controls, and significant relaxations have occurred in recent years. Nevertheless, under the current exchange control regulations, our management may be limited in its ability to consider strategic options and our shareholders may not be able to realize the premium over the current trading price of our shares. Although Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. is a U.S. corporation and is not itself subject to these regulations, the ability of New Aplitec to raise and deploy capital outside the Common Monetary Area is restricted. As of June 30, 2006, approximately 80.2% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by New Aplitec and its subsidiaries. During the year ended June 30, 2006, substantially all of our revenues were generated by New Aplitec and its subsidiaries. In particular, New Aplitec will generally not be permitted to export capital from South Africa or to hold foreign currency without the approval of SARB, unless such export of capital or foreign currency holding is permitted by the October 2004 liberalization measures. This restriction may affect New Aplitecs ability to pay dividends to Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. Moreover, although the requirement that SARB approve investments by South African companies outside of South Africa has been relaxed, this requirement could restrict our future international expansion. 35 SARB approval is required for New Aplitec to receive loans from and repay loans to non-residents of the Common Monetary Area. In addition, New Aplitec may not use income earned in South Africa to repay or service foreign debts, without SARBs approval. Repayment of principal and interest on such loans will usually be approved at the time of the granting of such loans, where the payment is limited to the amount borrowed and a market related rate of interest. New Aplitec will also need SARB approval to raise capital involving a currency other than South African rand, which approval may be provided subject to conditions. Thus, unless we can obtain funding at the Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. level, these restrictions could prevent us from obtaining adequate funding on acceptable terms for acquisitions and other business opportunities outside South Africa. Trade unions and labor laws. Most of South Africas major industries are unionized, and the majority of employees belong to trade unions. In the past, trade unions have had a significant impact on the collective bargaining process as well as on social and political reform in South Africa in general. We currently have approximately 183 unionized employees which represents approximately 10.4% of our workforce. Although in recent years we have not experienced any labor disruptions, such labor disruptions may occur in the future. In addition, the cost of complying with labor laws may adversely affect our operations. Regional instability. Historically, there has been regional, political, and economic instability in the countries surrounding South Africa. Such political or economic instability in neighboring countries could affect the social, political and economic conditions in South Africa, for example, as a result of immigration, and this could have a negative impact on our ability to manage our operations in the country. HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, which is exacerbated in the presence of HIV/AIDS, are major healthcare challenges in South Africa and other sub-Saharan countries. HIV infection among women in antenatal clinics throughout South Africa has risen from 1% in 1990 to nearly 25% in 2000. According to the most recent research published by the Medical Research Council of South Africa, over five million South Africans were HIV positive in 2004, resulting in a total population prevalence rate of approximately 11%. Under South African law, we are generally prohibited from testing employees to determine their HIV status. Due to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in South Africa, we may incur costs relating to the loss of personnel and the related loss of productivity as well as the costs relating to recruiting and training of new personnel. We are not able to quantify these costs accurately and cannot assure you that the costs we will incur in connection with this epidemic will not have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition. 36 There are risks relating to other countries in which we intend to operate that could adversely affect our future business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We intend to expand operations into countries and regions, including African countries outside South Africa, South America, Southeast Asia and Central Europe, that are subject to significantly differing political, economic and market conditions. Specific country and regional risks that may have a material impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition include: - political and economic instability; - loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities and insurrection; - competition from existing market participants that may have a longer history in or greater familiarity with the foreign markets we enter; - government interventions and protectionism; - potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices, including import and export license requirements, tariffs, legal structures and tax laws; - cancellation of contractual rights; - trade barriers; - difficulties in staffing and managing operations; - import and export restrictions; - adverse tax consequences; - the lack of well-developed legal systems which could make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights; - security and safety of employees; - restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency or export assets; - greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; - currency fluctuations; - indigenization and empowerment programs; - logistical and communications challenges; - changes in labor conditions; - discrimination against U.S. companies; and - exposure to liability under U.S. securities laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Many of these countries and regions are in various stages of developing institutions and legal and regulatory systems that are characteristic of democracies. However, institutions in these countries and regions may not yet be as firmly established as they are in democracies in the developed world. Many of these countries and regions are also in the process of transitioning to a market economy and, as a result, are experiencing changes in their economies and their government policies that can affect our investments in these countries and regions. Moreover, the procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory regimes in these countries and regions are still being developed and, therefore, existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. In some circumstances, it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided under those laws and regulations in a timely manner. As the political, economic and legal environments remain subject to continuous development, investors in these countries and regions face uncertainty as to the security of their investments. Any unexpected changes in the political or economic conditions in these or neighboring countries or others in the region may have a material adverse effect on the international investments that we have made or may make in the future, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. Volatility in the South African Rand to U.S. dollar exchange rate may adversely affect our reported operating results. The South African rand, or ZAR, is the primary operating currency for our business operations while our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. Because our sales are primarily denominated in ZAR, a decline in the value of the ZAR against the U.S. dollar may have a significant adverse effect on our reported results of operations. During the three years ended June 30, 2006, the ZAR/U.S. dollar exchange rate has been volatile , refer to Item 7 Currency Exchange Rate InformationActual exchange ratestable 3 and the graph beneath table 3. 37 As a result, although our reported results of operations were positively affected by currency fluctuations for the 2005 fiscal year compared to fiscal 2004, these fluctuations adversely affected our reported results for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. These fluctuations may make it more difficult for investors and others to understand how our business has performed without regard to these currency exchange rate changes. We expect that exchange rate volatility will continue in the foreseeable future. Trends in sales and profits may experience significant fluctuations as the rate of exchange between the ZAR and the U.S. dollar fluctuates. We cannot assure you what effect, if any, changes in the exchange rate of the ZAR against the U.S. dollar will have on our results of operations and financial condition. We do not currently engage in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations, other than economic hedging relating to our inventory purchases which are settled in U.S. dollars or euros. We have used forward contracts in order to hedge our economic exposure to the ZAR/U.S. dollar and ZAR/euro exchange rate fluctuations from these foreign currency transactions. We cannot guarantee that we will enter into hedging transactions in the future or, if we do, that these transactions will successfully protect us against currency fluctuations. The loss of the services of Dr. Belamant or any of our other executive officers would adversely affect our business. Our future financial and operational performance depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Dr. Serge Belamant, as well as Mr. Herman Kotze, our Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Brenda Stewart, our Senior Vice President-Marketing and Sales, and Mr. Nitin Soma, our Senior Vice President-Information Technology. Many of our key responsibilities are performed by these four individuals, and the loss of the services of any of them could disrupt our development efforts or business relationships and our ability to continue to innovate and to meet customers needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers, any of whom may terminate their employment at any time, nor do we maintain any key person life insurance policies. We face a highly competitive employment market and may not be successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of skilled employees, particularly in the technical and sales areas and senior management. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop new products that use our UEPS technology and to market these products to our target users. In order to succeed in our product development and marketing efforts, we need to identify, attract, motivate and retain sufficient numbers of qualified technical and sales personnel. An inability to hire and retain such technical personnel would adversely affect our ability to enhance our existing intellectual property, to introduce new generations of technology and to keep abreast of current developments in technology. Demand for personnel with the range of capabilities and experience we require is high and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining these employees. The risk exists that our technical skills and sales base may be depleted over time because of natural attrition. Furthermore, social and economic factors in South Africa have led, and continue to lead, numerous qualified individuals to leave the country, thus depleting the availability of qualified personnel in South Africa. In addition, our multi-country strategy will also require us to hire and retain highly qualified managerial personnel in each of these markets. If we cannot recruit and retain people with the appropriate capabilities and experience and effectively integrate these people into our business, it could negatively affect our product development and marketing activities. We pre-fund the payment of social welfare grants on behalf of our South African government customers and any payment defaults by these customers would adversely affect our operations. We use our internal cash resources and facilities to fund the payment of social welfare grants under our contracts with the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provincial governments. We recover these funds from the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government on a seven-day cyclical basis and from the Eastern Cape provincial government on a 14-day cyclical basis. Therefore, these pre-funding obligations expose us to the risk of default by the applicable provincial government. In addition, the number of social welfare grant beneficiaries in these provinces increased significantly during fiscal 2006, which increased our pre-funding requirements. Although no provincial government has ever defaulted on a repayment of funds at the end of the payment cycle, we cannot guarantee that such a default will not occur in the future. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial position and results of operations. 38 Our ability to operate our wage payment and insurance products businesses may be limited by existing South African banking and financial services laws and regulations. The South African retail banking market is highly regulated, but the South African government has identified the need to service the unbanked market through the liberalization of the regulatory environment in order for retailers and non-banking service providers to innovate products and delivery channels for the unbanked market. However, under current law and regulations, a portion of our South African wage payment business activities in the unbanked market requires us to be registered as a bank in South Africa or to have access to an existing banking license. We are not currently so registered, nor do have access to an existing license, and therefore are not entitled to perform these activities in South Africa and may face prosecution if we do. We have appointed expert advisers to assist us in identifying and executing the most appropriate methodology to obtain access to a license. While we believe that we will be able to obtain access to this license, there is a possibility that our methodology may not be successful or that a grant of the license may be delayed. In addition, the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002, requires persons who give advice regarding the purchase of financial products or who act as intermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers in South Africa to register as financial service providers. We have applied for a license under this Act in order to continue to provide advice and intermediary services in respect of the financial products on which we advise and the payment processing services we provide in South Africa on behalf of insurers and other financial product suppliers. While the license application is pending, we are entitled to continue this part of our business in South Africa. If we fail to obtain this license, we may be stopped from continuing this part of our business in South Africa. We may face competition from the incumbent retail banks in South Africa in the unbanked market segment. The incumbent South African retail banks recently announced a joint initiative to create a common banking product to offer to the significant portion of South Africas population that does not have access to traditional banking services, or the unbanked. This bank account, generally referred to as the Mzansi account, was introduced in October 2004 and offers limited transactional capabilities at reduced charges, when compared to the accounts traditionally offered by these banks. According to the FinScope 2005 survey 550,000 people (approximately 2% of the adult population) in South Africa claim to have an Mzanzi account, although the exact number of accounts is unknown. The social welfare beneficiaries who are currently paid through our smart card system may elect to use these accounts to receive their grants. A decision by a substantial number of these beneficiaries to elect to use these accounts rather than our smart card system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We may face increased competition as our sales and product offerings increase. In addition to competition that we face from the use of cash, checks, credit and debit cards, existing payment systems and the providers of financial services, we have identified a number of other products currently being produced that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system and the companies that promote them. These include EMV, a system that is being promoted by Visa International Service Association, MasterCard International and Europay International; Mondex International Limited, a subsidiary of MasterCard; and Proton World International N.V., a subsidiary of STMicroelectronics Belgium N.V. In South Africa, and specifically in the payment of social welfare grants, our competitors also include AllPay Consolidated Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd., which is responsible for social welfare payments in the Free State, Gauteng and Western Cape provinces and a small portion of the Eastern Cape province, and Empilweni Payout Services, which is responsible for payments in the Mpumalanga province. We also may face competition from companies to which we have licensed our technology, including Visa and BGS Smart Card Systems AG. Moreover, as our product offerings increase and gain market acceptance, banks in South Africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as infringing on their funds transfer or other businesses. 39 Patent competition may adversely affect our products or processes, and limited patent protection, a lack of proprietary protection and the potential to incur costly litigation could be harmful to our operations. Our products and technology have unique characteristics and structures and, as a result, are subject to patent protection, the extent of which varies from country to country. During the life of a patent, a product is only subject to competition by non-infringing products. However, aggressive patenting by our competitors and potential patent piracy may threaten protected products and processes and may result in an increased patent infringement risk, especially in emerging economies such as those where we currently operate. The expiration of a patent may also result in increased competition in the market for the previously patented products and processes. The patents for our FTS will expire, at the latest, in Namibia in 2007; in South Africa, Botswana, Swaziland and Hong Kong in 2009; and in the United States in 2011. In addition, our European Union FTS patent has been challenged and revoked. Consequently, we do not have any patent protection in the member countries of the European Union. Additionally, we could have difficulty asserting the Hong Kong patent as it is not registered in our name and it could be difficult to record our ownership of that patent. Further, BGS, the local system operator in the Commonwealth of Independent States has stopped paying licensing fees to us on the grounds that the revocation of the European FTS patent relieves it from the obligation to pay such fees, although we believe that the licensing fees relate to BGSs use of our UEPS technology rather than the FTS patent. There is a risk that a similar refusal to pay our licensing fees can occur elsewhere. Moreover, although we have certain patent rights in the United States, these are not expected to have significant utility in our business given that our management does not expect the U.S. market to become a material part of our business in the future. Each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, to date, we have relied not only on patent protections, but also on trade secret, trademark and copyright laws, as well as nondisclosure, licensing and other contractual arrangements to protect the proprietary aspects of our solutions. Other than the patents discussed above, we do not own any other patents that protect important aspects of our current solutions. We will, however, prepare patent applications where possible for technology related to our smart cards and UEPS system when we believe it is appropriate to do so. These applications and contractual arrangements and our reliance on these laws may not be successful. Litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets could result in substantial costs and may not be successful. Any loss of or inability to protect intellectual property in our technology could diminish our competitive advantage and also seriously harm our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, the United States and the European Union. Our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, the United States and the European Union or any other country in which we operate, may not be adequate to fully protect our intellectual property rights. Similarly, if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote substantial resources to the defense of such claims. We may be required to discontinue using and selling any infringing technology and services, to expend resources to develop non-infringing technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties for other technology. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in defending any such third-party claims, we could suffer costly judgments and injunctions that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. The copyrights and certain related intellectual property rights in earlier versions of our UEPS software are jointly owned and potentially subject to non-exclusive rights, which may reduce our future revenues. While we own the exclusive copyrights in the current version of the UEPS software, these copyrights are subject to the preexisting copyrights in the earlier versions of our software that are owned jointly by us and Nedbank. As joint owners of the copyrights in these earlier versions of our software that existed prior to July 2000, there is a risk that Nedbank could license these works to others and otherwise commercially exploit these earlier works. Under our Nedbank agreements, Nedbank also acquired the right to request a license of our South African and U.S. FTS patents and of all technology and know-how relating to the UEPS described in those earlier patents from us for entities partly owned by Nedbank that are located anywhere within South Africa and neighboring countries. Under these licenses, Nedbank would pay us a license fee, with us supplying smart cards or being paid a royalty if the cards are obtained from a third party. If Nedbank licenses our works to others or otherwise commercially exploits our technology and know-how related to UEPS, our future revenues may be reduced. 40 Our current license agreement with Visa imposes long-term restrictions on our ability to license rights in our technology and could inhibit our ability to realize additional revenue from these rights in our technology. In 1997, we entered into a technology license agreement with Visa. Under that agreement, Visa purchased a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide license to our technology rights, as defined in the agreement, relating to our UEPS technology and an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide license under our patents, as defined in the agreement, licensed to Visa that is exclusive to the financial services industry, as defined in the agreement. Our Visa agreement grants back to us the non-exclusive right under our Visa-licensed patents to make, use and sell our payment systems and other products in the financial services industry as discussed in the agreement. In our Visa agreement, Visa agrees not to grant a sublicense to any payment system to any entities in the financial services industry who are not members of Visa already if such entity already has a right to use such payment systems from us. The agreement permits Visa to sublicense our licensed technology rights to any of its members, any entity in the financial services industry or any entity outside of the financial services industry that provides products to Visa or its sublicensees. The agreement prohibits us from licensing our technology rights, not just our licensed patents, to any of Visas competitors, including MasterCard, Europay, American Express Company, Discover Financial Services, Diners Club International Credit Card Co., Carte Blanche Card or JCB International Credit Card Co. or any of their parents, subsidiaries or affiliates. We may need Visas consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, in order to transfer or assign our rights and obligations under the agreement. As this agreement does not contain a termination date and contains restrictions on our ability to license our technology rights in the financial services industry and to competitors of Visa, we may not be able to realize the full value of our technology rights. Our license agreement with Visa substantially impacts our ability to defend and enforce our patents licensed to Visa and could substantially inhibit our ability to protect the rights in our technology. Under our license agreement with Visa, we are restricted from suing Visa, its members and any third-party vendors or customers of Visa or its members for infringement of our technology rights licensed to Visa in connection with their manufacture, use or sale of any product or service offered by Visa. The license also grants Visa sole discretion with regard to enforcement of any of the licensed technology rights against third parties in the financial services industry. Under the agreement, Visa has the right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and related patent applications we have licensed to Visa in all jurisdictions, and we are obligated to cooperate and support any of Visas actions in this regard. This arrangement could substantially impact our ability to defend these patents, and could make enforcement actions against our competitors more difficult. We depend upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business. We obtain our smart cards, POS devices and the other hardware we use in our business from a limited number of suppliers, and do not manufacture this equipment ourselves. We generally do not have long-term agreements with our manufacturers or component suppliers. If our suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide us with adequate supplies of parts or products when we need them, or if they increase their prices, we may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and could be faced with a critical shortage. This could harm our ability to implement new systems and cause our revenues to decline. Even if we are able to secure alternative sources in a timely manner, our costs could increase. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond current suppliers capabilities could harm our ability to distribute our equipment and thus, to acquire a new source of customers who use our UEPS technology. Any interruption in the supply of the hardware necessary to operate our technology, or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Escalating pricing pressures from our retail customers may adversely affect our business. We have experienced pressure from our retail merchant customers seeking to negotiate the fees we charge them. This pricing pressure could cause us to reduce the level of the fees we charge to these customers, which could adversely impact our revenues and profit margins. 41 System failures, including breaches in the security of our system, could harm our business. We may experience system failures from time to time, and any lengthy interruption in the availability of our back-end system computer, could harm our revenues and profits, and could subject us to the scrutiny of our government customers. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers and users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to avoid our technology altogether, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. These interruptions would increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new applications and services. Finally, because our customers may use our products for critical transactions, any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses. These customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim could be time consuming and costly for us to address. Although our systems have been designed to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Protection against fraud is of key importance to the purchasers and end users of our solutions. We incorporate security features, including encryption software, biometric identification and secure hardware, into our solutions to protect against fraud in electronic transactions and to provide for the privacy and integrity of card holder data. Our solutions may be vulnerable to breaches in security due to defects in the security mechanisms, the operating system and applications or the hardware platform. Security vulnerabilities could jeopardize the security of information transmitted using our solutions. If the security of our solutions is compromised, our reputation and marketplace acceptance of our solutions will be adversely affected, which would cause our business to suffer, and we may become subject to damage claims. We have not yet experienced any security breaches affecting our business. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems with our system could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Our current business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. We may not be able to exploit technological advances quickly and successfully, which could impair our competitive position and operations. Most of our operations depend on the use of advanced technological methods, which must keep pace with rapid technological changes, new product introductions by competitors, evolving industry and government performance and security standards and changes in customer and end-user requirements. The use of the appropriate advanced technological procedures can affect, among other things, the competitiveness of our products, the safety of transactions performed using our products, the continuity of our operations and the capacity and efficiency of our production. We believe that new technologies may emerge and that existing technologies may be further developed in the fields in which we operate. Unexpected rapid changes in employed technologies that affect our operations and product range could render the technologies we use obsolete or less competitive in the future. Difficulties in accessing new technologies may impede us from implementing them and competitive pressures may force us to implement these new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, limited access to sources of new capital to acquire new technologies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business or on our ability to provide competitive products. Our ability to meet the competition will depend on our timely and cost-effective implementation of new technological advances. It will also depend on our success in commercializing these advances in spite of competition we face by patents registered by our competitors. If we are unable to implement new technologies in a timely or cost-efficient basis or penetrate new markets in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 42 We may incur material losses in connection with our distribution of cash to recipients of social welfare grants. Many social welfare recipients use our services to access cash using their smart cards. We use armored vehicles to deliver large amounts of cash to rural areas across South Africa to enable these welfare recipients to receive this cash. In some cases, we also store the cash that will be delivered by the armored vehicles in depots overnight or over the weekend to facilitate delivery to these rural areas. We cannot insure against the risk of loss or theft of cash from our delivery vehicles as we have not identified any insurance underwriters willing to accept this risk. Therefore, we will bear the full cost of any loss or theft in connection with the delivery process, and such loss could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. During the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we incurred losses in connection with our cash delivery system of $2.1 million, $2.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively. We may not recover outstanding amounts owed to our micro-finance businesses. We operate a traditional micro-finance business, with approximately 85 branches throughout South Africa. These branches extend short-term loans for periods ranging from 30 days to four months at loans bearing interest rates of 15% to 30% per month. Despite the fact that we attempt to reduce credit risk by employing credit profiling techniques, the rate of default on loans has been high due to the high credit risk of these borrowers and the difficulty of collecting outstanding repayments. We may therefore not recover some or all of the principal and interest amounts currently owed by our borrowers, which on June 30, 2006, totaled $3.7 million. Our inability to recover some or all of these amounts may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may undertake other acquisitions that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business. One of our strategies is to pursue selective acquisitions. Although we do not currently have any commitments, contracts or understandings to acquire any specific businesses or other material operations, we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and will consider other acquisitions in the future. We may not be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates at prices that we consider appropriate or to finance acquisitions on terms that are satisfactory to us. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition or, if the acquisition occurs, integrate the acquired business into our existing business. Acquisitions of businesses or other material operations may require debt financing or additional equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Integration of acquired business operations could disrupt our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. We also may not be able to maintain key employees or customers of an acquired business or realize cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates. In addition, we may need to record write downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings. At times, acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition. We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the Prism acquisition We anticipate several benefits from the Prism acquisition, including: enhancing our geographical penetration in South Africa via Prisms terminals located in semi-urban stores, and thereby strengthen our merchant acquiring footprint; expand our product lines to include services such as Prisms prepaid water, electric and mobile phone business; take advantage of Prisms smart card manufacturing capabilities; increase the total number of transactions we process and are capable of processing; augment and bolster our management team, technical staff and development professionals; amplify our technological advantage by providing us with access to Prisms SIM card patented cell phone technology; and expand our market reach into new geographical areas such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia through Prisms existing operations. 43 There can be no assurance that any of these or other anticipated benefits will materialize and we cant give any indication of the time frame we will require to achieve any of these benefits. The acquisition, development, adoption, exploitation and distribution of new and existing technology may take long periods of time and may require significant capital investments. Prism has a concentrated customer base, especially for its terminal base and card sales, and the loss of any significant customer may expose us to material financial, credit or performance risks and impair our ability to realize any benefits from Prisms customer base. Prisms card manufacturing business, which constitutes 13% of the pro-forma operating profit of the company, is exposed to significant competitive risk from low-cost/high volume producers in other regions. Prism currently provides GSM cards to local South African and international customers. Prism may not be able to compete successfully with these low-cost/high volume producers and may lose the revenues and profits generated by this business. Prism relies on third party platforms that we do not own or control and are subject to constraints within a number of our core regions. If these facilities fail to provide us with adequate capacity, we may be restricted in our ability to deliver key services to our customers and we may either incur additional costs or forego revenues. Conversely, improvements to certain third party systems could also reduce revenue. Prisms services and technologies may not achieve widespread commercial success or its products or services may not appeal to enough customers, may not be available at competitive prices, may not function as expected or may not be delivered in a timely fashion EasyPay is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements Prisms business is subject to extensive regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. Since we have only recently completed the Prism acquisition and have not yet filed audited financial statements of Prism or financial information showing the pro forma effect of the acquisition on our historical financial statements, you may not be able to evaluate the financial impact of the acquisition on us Under applicable SEC rules, we will be required to file no later than September 19, 2006, an amendment to the Form 8-K that we filed reporting the acquisition, which amendment must include audited financial statements of Prism and financial information showing the pro forma effect of the acquisition on our historical results of operations as if the transaction had been completed on July 1, 2005, the beginning of our last fiscal year and on our financial condition as if the transaction had been completed on June 30, 2006. While we are currently in the process of preparing the required financial statements and pro forma financial information and expect to timely file the Form 8-K/A, until we actually file the Form 8-K/A, you will not be in a position to evaluate Prisms historical financial position, results of operations or cash flows or to evaluate the pro forma impact of the acquisition on our historical financial position or results of operations. We may be subject to privacy laws in South Africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our collection, storage and processing, and any disclosure of, customer and employee personal information must comply with South Africas privacy laws, which are at various stages of legislative and judicial development. However, South African common law and the South African Constitution do recognize an individuals right to privacy, and there are some statutes and other regulations which have been enacted that apply to us and the way we operate our business. For example, one statute sets out a framework for the electronic collection, processing, storage and disclosure of personal information. Although compliance with this statute is voluntary, a South African court could determine that we would be violating an individuals right to privacy if we do not operate in compliance with this framework. In addition, South African law requires that we must keep confidential the HIV status of the people that participate in our HIV/AIDS program. 44 New privacy laws may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the way we do business, and we could be required to devote substantial management time and resources to comply with these new laws. In addition, if we violate, or are judged to have violated, the privacy rights of people whose information we collect, store and process, we could become liable for damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Our international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international regulations. We need to comply with a number of international regulations in countries outside of the United States. In addition, we must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage. Any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees and agents comply with the FCPA and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties and/or restrictions in our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Department of The Treasurys Office of Foreign Asset Control, or OFAC, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. As a result, we are restricted from entering into transactions with certain targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals except as permitted by OFAC which may reduce our future growth. We may be required to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock. We may require additional financing to fund future operations, including expansion in current and new markets, programming development and acquisition, capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies. Because of the early stage of development of our operations and exposure to market risks associated with economies in emerging markets, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced, and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price and voting power of shares of common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us. We may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock. In recent years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performances, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control. If our business development plans are successful, additional financing may be required to continue to develop and exploit existing and new technologies and to expand into new markets. The exploitation of our technologies may, therefore, be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means. 45 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of factors outside of our control, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We expect our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter. As a consequence, our operating results in any single quarter may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Factors that may affect our operating results include: - demand for and acceptance of our new product offerings; - delays in the implementation and delivery of our products and services, which may impact the timing of our recognition of revenue; - variations in product mix and cost during any period; - development of new relationships and maintenance and enhancement of existing relationships with customers and strategic partners; - difficulties with component supplies, manufacturing or distribution; - deferral of customer contracts in anticipation of product or service enhancements; - timing of commencement, implementation or completion of major implementation projects; - the relative mix of net revenues from established markets, including South Africa, and unestablished markets; - fluctuations in currency exchange rates; - the fixed nature of many of our expenses; and - industry and economic conditions, including competitive pressures and inventory obsolescence. In particular, differences in relative growth rates between our businesses in our established markets for certain products and unestablished markets may have a significant effect on our operating results, particularly our reported operating profit percentage, in any individual quarter, with unestablished market sales typically carrying lower margins in the initial phases of our operations in a new area or the introduction of a new product to an area in which we already operate. Certain transactions are difficult to predict and may have a significant effect on our operating results. Sales of this nature include hardware sales to customers and to our SmartSwitch investments and cause fluctuations in revenue and operating income when they occur. The period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the sale of our products or services to that customer tends to be long and may be subject to delays which may have an impact on our revenues. The period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our products and services is often long and subject to delays associated with the budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that frequently accompany significant capital expenditures. A lengthy sales cycle may have an impact on the timing of our revenues, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fall below investor expectations. A customers decision to purchase our products and services is often discretionary, involves a significant commitment of resources, and is influenced by customer budgetary cycles. To sell our products and services successfully we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the uses and benefits of our products and services, which can require the expenditure of significant time and resources; however, there can be no assurance that this significant expenditure of time and resources will result in actual sales of our products and services. We may become subject to a U.S. tax liability for failing to withhold on certain distributions on instruments issued in connection with the Aplitec transaction. There is no statutory, judicial or administrative authority that directly addresses the tax treatment of non-U.S. holders that elected to receive units in a trust representing beneficial interests in B class preference shares and B class loan accounts issued by New Aplitec pursuant to the reinvestment option in connection with our acquisition of Aplitec. We believe these interests should be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as, and we did treat them as, separate and distinct interests in New Aplitec. As such, we and our affiliates do not presently intend to withhold any amounts for U.S. federal taxes in respect of any distributions paid on such interests. There is a risk, however, that these interests, together with the special convertible preferred stock, may be treated as representing a single direct equity interest in us for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, distributions received with respect to the B class preference shares and B class loan accounts could be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, and we could be liable for failure to withhold such taxes in our capacity as withholding agent. In addition, our failure to collect and remit U.S. federal withholding tax may also subject us to penalties. 46 Shipments of our electronic payment systems may be delayed by factors outside of our control, which can harm our reputation and our relationships with our customers. The shipment of payment systems requires us or our manufacturers, distributors or other agents to obtain customs or other government certifications and approvals and, on occasion, to submit to physical inspection of our systems in transit. Failure to satisfy these requirements, and the very process of trying to satisfy them, can lead to lengthy delays in the delivery of our solutions to our direct or indirect customers. Delays and unreliable delivery by us may harm our reputation in the industry and our relationships with our customers. Force majeure events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, political instability and health epidemics may adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks, war and international political instability, along with health epidemics, may disrupt our ability to generate revenues. These events may negatively affect our ability to maintain sales revenue and to develop new business relationships. Because a substantial and growing part of our revenues is derived from sales and services to customers outside of the United States and we have our electronic payment systems manufactured outside the United States, terrorist attacks, war and international political instability anywhere may decrease international demand for our products and inhibit customer development opportunities abroad, disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to deliver our electronic payment systems, which could materially adversely affect our net revenues or results of operations. Any of these events may also disrupt global financial markets and precipitate a decline in the price of our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None 47
