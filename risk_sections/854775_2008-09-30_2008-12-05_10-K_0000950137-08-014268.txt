risk factors exist which could have a material effect on our operations, results of operations, profitability, financial position, liquidity, capital resources and common stock. Risks Relating to Our Business Our dependence on new product development and the rapid technological change that characterizes our industry makes us susceptible to loss of market share resulting from competitors product introductions and similar risks. The communications technology industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and rapidly changing customer requirements. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products, to introduce new products to meet changing customer requirements and emerging technologies, and to demonstrate the performance advantages and cost-effectiveness of our products over competing products. Failure by us to modify our products to support new alternative technologies or failure to achieve widespread customer acceptance of such modified products could cause us to lose market share and cause our revenues to decline. We may experience delays in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change, evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements. There can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, and marketing of these products or product enhancements, or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market acceptance in existing or additional markets. In addition, the future introductions or announcements of products by us or one of our competitors embodying new technologies or changes in industry standards or customer requirements could render our then-existing products obsolete or unmarketable. There can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by us or one or more of our competitors will not cause customers to defer their purchase of our existing products, which could cause our revenues to decline. We intend to continue to devote significant resources to our research and development, which, if not successful, could cause a decline in our revenues and harm our business. We intend to continue to devote significant resources to research and development in the coming years to enhance and develop additional products. For the fiscal years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, our research and development expenses comprised 14.6%, 14.0% and 14.4%, respectively, of our net sales. If we are unable to develop new products as a result of our research and development efforts, or if the products we develop are not successful, our business could be harmed. Even if we develop new products that are accepted by our target markets, the net revenues from these products may not be sufficient to justify our investment in research and development. Many of our products have been developed through a combination of internally developed technologies and acquired technologies. Our ability to continue to develop new products is partially dependent on finding and acquiring new technologies in the marketplace. Even if we identify new technologies that we believe would be complementary to our internally developed technologies, we may not be successful in acquiring those technologies or we may not be able to acquire the technologies at a price that is acceptable to us. A substantial portion of our recent development efforts have been directed toward the development of new products targeted to manufacturers of intelligent, network-enabled devices and other embedded systems in various markets, including markets in which networking solutions for embedded systems have not historically 14 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) been sold, such as markets for industrial automation equipment, security equipment and medical equipment. Our financial performance is dependent upon the development of the intelligent device markets that we are targeting, the increasing adoption of wireless technologies by these markets and our ability to successfully compete and sell our products to manufacturers of these intelligent devices. Certain of our products are sold into mature markets, which could limit our ability to continue to generate revenue from these products. Certain of our products provide asynchronous and synchronous data transmissions via add-on cards. The market for add-on asynchronous and synchronous data communications cards is mature. Furthermore, certain applications of our embedded network interface cards are also considered mature. As the overall market for these products decreases due to the adoption of new technologies, we expect that our revenues from these products will continue to decline. As a result, our future prospects depend in large part on our ability to acquire or develop and successfully market additional products that address growth markets. Our failure to effectively manage product transitions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. From time to time, we or our competitors may announce new products, capabilities, or technologies that may replace or shorten the life cycles of our existing products. Announcements of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing our products until new products become available. Furthermore, the introduction of new or enhanced products requires us to manage the transition from older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand. Our failure to effectively manage transitions from older products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. Our failure to compete successfully in our highly competitive market could result in reduced prices and loss of market share. The market in which we operate is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards. The market can be significantly affected by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants. We compete for customers on the basis of existing and planned product features, company reputation, brand recognition, technical support, relationships with partners, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price, and availability. Certain of our competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial, technological, manufacturing, marketing, and personnel resources than us. Present and future competitors may be able to identify new markets and develop products more quickly, which are superior to those developed by us. They may also adapt new technologies faster, devote greater resources to research and development, promote products more aggressively, and price products more competitively than us. There are no assurances that competition will not intensify or that we will be able to compete effectively in the markets in which we compete. Our inability to obtain the appropriate telecommunications carrier certifications or approvals from other governmental regulatory bodies could impede our ability to grow revenues in our wireless products. The sale of our wireless products in certain geographical markets is sometimes dependent on the ability to gain telecommunications carrier certifications and/or approvals by certain governmental bodies. Failure to obtain these approvals, or delays in receiving the approvals, could impact our ability to enter our targeted markets or to compete effectively or at all in these markets and could have an adverse impact on our revenues. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) The cyclicality of the semiconductor industry may result in substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results. Our semiconductor products provide networking capabilities for intelligent, network-enabled devices and other embedded systems. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to rapid technological change and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times, characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity. The semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints. As a result, we may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions. Loss of one or more of our key customers could have an adverse effect on our revenues. Our sales are primarily made on the basis of purchase orders rather than under long-term agreements, and therefore, any customer could cease purchasing our products at any time without penalty. The decision of any key customer, including our distributors, to cease using our products or a material decline in the number of units purchased by a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. The long and variable sales cycle for certain of our products makes it more difficult for us to predict our operating results and manage our business. The sale of our products typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by potential customers and end users, as well as delays frequently associated with end users internal procedures to deploy new technologies within their products and to test and accept new technologies. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with certain of our products is typically lengthy and is subject to a number of significant risks, including end users internal purchasing reviews, that are beyond our control. Because of the lengthy sales cycle and the large size of certain customer orders, if orders forecasted for a specific customer are not realized or delayed, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. We depend on manufacturing relationships and on limited-source suppliers, and any disruptions in these relationships may cause damage to our customer relationships. We procure all parts and certain services involved in the production of our products and subcontract most of our product manufacturing to outside firms that specialize in such services. Although most of the components of our products are available from multiple vendors, we have several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us. There can be no assurance that our suppliers will be able to meet our future requirements for products and components in a timely fashion. In addition, the availability of many of these components to us is dependent in part on our ability to provide our suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future requirements. Delays or lost sales could be caused by other factors beyond our control, including late deliveries by vendors of components. If we are required to identify alternative suppliers for any of our required components, qualification and pre-production periods could be lengthy and may cause an increase in component costs and delays in providing products to customers. Any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from limited sources could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships and profitability. Our use of suppliers in Southeast Asia involves risks that could negatively impact us. We purchase printed circuit boards from suppliers in Southeast Asia. Product delivery times may be extended due to the distances involved, requiring more lead time in ordering. In addition, ocean freight delays may occur as a result of labor problems, weather delays or expediting and customs issues. Any extended delay in receipt of the component parts could eliminate anticipated cost savings and have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships and profitability. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) Our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights. Our ability to compete depends in part on our proprietary rights and technology. Our proprietary rights and technology are protected by a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents. We enter into confidentiality agreements with all employees, and sometimes with our customers and potential customers, and limit access to the distribution of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us in this regard will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology. Our pending patent applications may be denied and any patents, once issued, may be circumvented by our competitors. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are superior to our technologies. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technology. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and result in loss of revenue. From time to time, we are subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights or other claims, which could seriously harm us and require us to incur significant costs. The communications technology industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive notification of a third-party claim that our products infringe other intellectual property rights. Any litigation to determine the validity of third-party infringement claims, whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us, may be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from productive tasks, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and service the needs of our customers. There can be no assurance that any infringement claims by third parties, if proven to have merit, will not materially adversely affect our business or financial condition. In the event of an adverse ruling in any such matter, we may be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or be required to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement. There can be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any limitations on our ability to market our products, or delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties, or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We face risks associated with our international operations and expansion that could impair our ability to grow our revenues abroad. We believe that our future growth is dependent in part upon our ability to increase sales in international markets. These sales are subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax consequences, and export license requirements. In addition, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. There can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and financial condition. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) The loss of key personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy. Our business and prospects depend to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our executive officers and our key technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could result in our failure to execute our business strategy. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results. Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or our interpretation of such laws. In addition, we may be subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other U.S. and international tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an effect on our operating results and financial condition. Any acquisitions we have made or will make could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition. We will continue to consider acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies. In the event of any future purchases, we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership, incur debt, assume liabilities, or incur large and immediate write-offs. Our operation of any acquired business may also involve numerous risks, including:  problems combining the purchased operations, technologies, or products;  unanticipated costs;  diversion of managements attention from our core business;  difficulties integrating businesses in different countries and cultures;  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and  potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the purchased organization. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we have acquired or that we might acquire in the future and any failure to do so could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, from time to time, we may enter into negotiations for a proposed acquisition, but be unable or unwilling to consummate the acquisition under consideration. This could cause significant diversion of managements attention and out-of-pocket expenses for us. We could also be exposed to litigation as a result of an unconsummated acquisition, including claims that we failed to negotiate in good faith or misappropriated confidential information. Our failure to effectively comply with the requirements of applicable environmental legislation and regulation could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations. In addition, certain states and countries may pass new regulations requiring our products to meet certain requirements to use environmentally friendly components. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in jurisdictions in which we operate. The European Union has issued two directives relating to chemical substances in electronic products. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 18 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) (WEEE) makes producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment financially responsible for collection, reuse, recycling, treatment and disposal of equipment placed in the European Union market after August 13, 2005. The Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) bans the use of certain hazardous materials in electric and electrical equipment which are put on the market in the European Union after July 1, 2006. In the future, China and other countries including the United States are expected to adopt further environmental compliance programs. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may not be able to sell our products in jurisdictions where these regulations apply, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. Negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio consists of commercial paper and corporate bonds. These marketable securities are classified at September 30, 2008 as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Recent market conditions indicate significant uncertainty on the part of global investors regarding the global economic outlook and for financial institutions that have potential exposure to the sub-prime housing market. As a result, some of our investments may have experienced reduced liquidity. In addition, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the securities and record an impairment charge should the impairment be considered as other-than-temporary. This loss would be recorded in our consolidated statement of operations, which could materially adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Our consolidated operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic conditions and credit tightening. Worldwide economic conditions have recently experienced a significant downturn due to the credit conditions impacted by the subprime mortgage crisis and other factors, including slower economic activity, inflation and deflation concerns, increased energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits, reduced or canceled capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns. These conditions may make it difficult or impossible for our customers and suppliers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, which may cause them to slow or suspend spending on products and services. As our customers face this challenging economic time, they may find it difficult to gain sufficient credit in a timely manner, which could result in an impairment of their ability to place orders with us or to make timely payments to us for previous purchases. If this occurs, our revenue may be reduced, thereby having a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, we may be forced to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding may increase, which would have a negative impact on our cash position, liquidity and financial condition. We cannot predict the timing or the duration of this or any other economic downturn in the economy. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, including our reserves for uncertain tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) Risks Related to Our Common Stock If our stock price declines, we may need to recognize an impairment of our goodwill. The current global economic crisis has impacted the stock prices of many companies. If the price of our common stock is impacted, we could have an impairment of our goodwill. Our value is dependent upon continued future growth in demand for our products. If such growth does not materialize or our forecasts are significantly reduced, we could have to recognize an impairment of our goodwill. We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2008, on our one reporting unit. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount and therefore goodwill is not considered impaired. When the assessment was performed, our market capitalization, which is an indicator of fair value, was below the carrying value of our reporting unit due to significant declines in our stock price during the year. However, an estimated control premium was also used in our determination of fair value. The control premium represents the amount an investor would pay, over and above market capitalization, in order to obtain a controlling interest in a company. Therefore, the fair value of our reporting unit was measured using our market capitalization as of June 30, 2008, plus a control premium in a range of 20% to 30%. The estimated control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years. The control premium used in our determination of fair value is subject to management judgment, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. At September 30, 2008, our market capitalization, which approximates fair value, exceeded our carrying value. The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate in the future. The market price of our common stock, like that of many other high-technology companies, has fluctuated significantly and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. During fiscal year 2008, the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from $7.72 to $17.13 per share. Our closing sale price on November 28, 2008 was $9.22 per share. Announcements by us or others regarding the receipt of customer orders, quarterly variations in operating results, acquisitions or divestitures, additional equity or debt financings, results of customer field trials, scientific discoveries, technological innovations, litigation, product developments, patent or proprietary rights, government regulation and general market conditions may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. Certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our charter documents have an anti-takeover effect. There exist certain mechanisms under the Delaware General Corporation Law and our charter documents that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control. For instance, under Delaware law, we are prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with interested stockholders for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless certain requirements are met, and majority stockholder approval is required for certain business combination transactions with interested parties. Our Certificate of Incorporation contains a fair price provision requiring majority stockholder approval for certain business combination transactions with interested parties, and this provision may not be changed without the vote of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of our voting stock. Other mechanisms in our charter documents may also delay, defer or prevent a change of control. For instance, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that our Board of Directors has authority to issue series of our preferred stock with such voting rights and other powers as the Board of Directors may determine. Furthermore, we have a classified board of directors, which means that our directors are divided into three classes that are elected to three-year terms on a staggered basis. Since the three-year terms of each class overlap the terms of the other classes of directors, the entire board of directors cannot be replaced in any one year. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) In addition, under Delaware law, directors serving on a classified board may not be removed by shareholders except for cause. Pursuant to the terms of a shareholder rights plan adopted in 1998 and renewed in 2008, each outstanding share of common stock has one attached right. The rights will cause substantial dilution of the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by the Board of Directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts. The effect of these anti-takeover provisions may be to deter business combination transactions not approved by our Board of Directors, including acquisitions that may offer a premium over the market price to some or all stockholders. We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so. We have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 21 Table of Contents
