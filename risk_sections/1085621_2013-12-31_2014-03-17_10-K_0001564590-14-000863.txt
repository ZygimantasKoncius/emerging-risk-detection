ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Our businesses involve a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. You should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties we describe below and all of the other information in this Report before deciding to invest in our stock. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties about which we currently do not know or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our businesses, financial condition or operating results. If the market for cloud-based software develops more slowly than we expect or declines, our business could be adversely affected. The market for cloud-based software is not as mature as the market for on-premise enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether cloud-based software will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud-based software solutions. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud computing. Other enterprises have not elected to move from traditional processes that are not Web-based to automated cloud-based processes. It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our businesses’ products, the future growth rate and size of the cloud-based software market or the entry of competitive applications. The expansion of the cloud-based software market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with cloud-based software, as well as the ability of cloud-based software companies to address security and privacy concerns. If other cloud-based software providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for cloud-based applications as a whole, including our applications, may be negatively affected. If cloud-based software does not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand for cloud-based software caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, it could result in decreased revenues and our business could be adversely affected. If analysts, investors and other participants in public and/or private markets change the way that they currently value cloud-based businesses, such as those we currently own and those we could acquire, our stock price could be adversely affected. At the present time, public and private cloud-based businesses are being valued based on relatively high multiples of their historical and/or forecasted revenues, with less of a focus on their current levels of profitability. Given the emphasis placed on the revenue growth of cloud-based businesses, we intend to continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing to drive revenue growth at our businesses. In the event that analysts, investors and other market participants begin to value cloud-based businesses, which comprise our core group of assets, based on lower revenue multiples or on profitability or some other metric, our stock price could be adversely affected, regardless of the performance of those businesses. Moreover, our strategy calls for us to deploy a significant amount of capital in the coming years to acquire cloud-based businesses. To the extent that we acquire any cloud-based business based on current valuation practices/metrics, and those practices/metrics change as contemplated above, our stock price could be adversely affected, regardless of the performance of the business or businesses that we acquire. 6 Our business strategy, which calls for the ownership and operation of a concentrated group of majority-owned cloud-based businesses, may subject us to additional risks. In recent years, we have disposed of our interests in a number of businesses, including Procurian, which historically accounted for a significant amount of our revenue and earnings. We have opted to focus our human and financial capital on a smaller number of majority-owned businesses. We currently operate three relatively small majority-owned businesses, each of which offers cloud-based software and services. Because we have reduced the extent to which our holdings are diversified, we have concentrated the risk on our three majority-owned businesses. As a result, the occurrence of a material adverse event or existence of a material adverse condition at any one of our three majority-owned businesses could have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. Moreover, our strategy calls for us to deploy a significant amount of capital in the coming years to acquire cloud-based businesses. To the extent that we acquire any such business, the occurrence of a material adverse event or existence of a material adverse condition at that business could have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. We face intense competition and may not be able to compete successfully. Our businesses compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive cloud-based technology markets and are subject to ever-changing technology, shifting customer needs and preferences and frequent introduction of products and services. We expect competition in those markets to intensify in the coming years. Our businesses’ current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups both horizontally and vertically focused. Established companies, on the one hand, have greater resources, more comprehensive and complementary product and service offerings, longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers. Those companies can use their experience and resources to compete with our businesses in a variety of ways, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development and sales and marketing, and offering more attractive commercial terms to customers, service providers and other strategic partners. Emerging start-ups, on the other hand, may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than our businesses can. If our businesses’ competitors are collectively more successful than our businesses are in developing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining customers, our consolidated revenues and growth rates could decline. Our inability to attract new customers could negatively affect our results of operations and our financial condition. Our businesses may not be able to attract customers due to a variety of reasons, including increased competition, the unwillingness of potential customers to shift to cloud-based processes or spend money on non-core products and services, especially during periods of economic uncertainty, customer insolvency and the unavailability of credit for customers. If our businesses are unable to attract new customers, our results of operations and our financial condition could be negatively affected. If our customers, including certain significant customers, do not renew their contracts for our products or if they do not renew them on terms that are favorable to us, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.Our customer contracts have terms that generally range from one to three years. As the end of these terms approach, we seek to renew the agreements. Historically, renewals have represented a significant portion of our total revenue. Because of this characteristic of our business, if our customers, particularly our significant customers, choose not to renew their contracts on beneficial terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our products and services and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels.If we are unable to upsell additional or enhanced products and services to our existing customers, our results of operations could be negatively affected.Our future success depends in part on our businesses’ ability to sell additional or enhanced products and services to their existing current customers. The rate at which our businesses’ customers purchase additional or enhanced products and services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions. If our businesses’ efforts to upsell to existing customers are not successful, our results of operations may be negatively affected. The loss of or reduction in business from one or more significant customers could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Some of our businesses have significant individual customer relationships. If our businesses are unable to retain one or more significant customers, or if their customers collectively reduce by a significant amount the products or services that they purchase from our businesses, we could fail to achieve our internal financial forecasts and related revenue and earnings guidance, and our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. 7 Some of our businesses incur significant expenses in connection with long selling cycles and/or implementation cycles which may take time to recover or will not be recovered if they are unsuccessful in securing new customer contracts. Some of our businesses face long selling cycles and/or implementation cycles in connection with securing new contracts and may incur significant expenses during the selling cycle and/or implementation cycles. Our businesses may not succeed in securing contractual relationships with prospective clients, in which case they would receive no revenues or reimbursement for those expenses and, even if they do secure new clients, they may incur significant implementation costs that take time to recover. The incurrence of such costs and the delay or inability to recover them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Some of our businesses’ long selling and implementation cycles make it difficult for us to prepare internal financial forecasts. Long and varying selling and implementation cycles for our businesses, particularly Bolt, may make it difficult for us to accurately predict whether and when prospective customers will enter into contracts to purchase products or services and when our businesses will recognize revenue from those contracts. As a result, it is difficult for us to create precise internal financial forecasts, our actual results may vary from our internal financial forecasts, and our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of the public market, securities analysts or investors. Because we recognize subscription revenue from our customers over the terms of their agreements, downturns or upturns in bookings may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We recognize subscription revenue over the terms of our businesses’ customer agreements, which typically range from one to three years. As a result, most of our quarterly subscription revenue results from agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our software and related services in any quarter may not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter, but could negatively affect revenue in future quarters. We may not be able to adjust our cost structure to compensate for this potential shortfall in revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales of subscriptions to our businesses’ software and related services may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our subscription revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription terms. Potential customers may be unwilling to implement the business changes attendant to the use of some of our cloud-based software and services. The use of our cloud-based software and services often requires customers to implement changes to their existing business process or to adapt new business processes with which they are unfamiliar. Some of our potential customers may continue to rely on existing internal solutions or other non-cloud-based solutions rather than implement the business changes called for by our solutions. Our focus on vertical cloud solutions may make it more difficult for us to obtain customers and compete with providers of horizontal cloud solutions. We serve vertical markets where we believe our cloud-based solutions can create unique and compelling value for customers. Although our focus on vertical markets is an important factor that differentiates us from our competitors, the narrow focus of our offerings could make it more difficult for us to compete with providers of horizontal cloud solutions, which, due to their focus on multiple markets, may be larger, better-capitalized and better known due to their focus on multiple markets. The loss of key personnel, or our inability to attract additional key personnel, could result in significant business disruption and harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain exceptional key personnel. If our key personnel, including the chief executives at our businesses, were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, or if we were unable to continue to hire exceptional personnel, our operations could be disrupted, and our operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. Interruption of our businesses’ operations, infrastructures or systems upon which they rely could prevent them from delivering their products and services to their customers, which could significantly harm our business. Because our businesses are primarily conducted over the Internet, they depend on their abilities to protect computer equipment and the information stored in computer equipment, offices and hosting facilities against damage from earthquake, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion and other events. There can be no assurance that our businesses’ disaster preparedness will prevent significant interruption of their operations. In addition, our businesses engage third-party facility providers for their hosting facilities and related infrastructure that is essential for their subscription services. Service to our businesses’ customers could be interrupted in the event of a natural disaster, by a hosting provider decision to close a facility or terminate operations, or by other unanticipated problems. Similarly, our businesses use third-party telecommunications providers for Internet 8 and other telecommunication services. Any of those third-party providers may fail to perform their obligations adequately, and any third-party systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled for varying periods of time, causing business interruption, system damage, or inability to process funds on behalf of customers, which could reduce our businesses’ revenues, cause them to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, cause other liability to customers, or cause regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Our businesses may become liable for damages to their customers for breaches of warranties and lose customers if they have errors, defects or disruptions in their service or if they provide poor service. Our businesses deliver cloud-based software and services. Errors or defects in the software applications underlying those services, failures of the hosting infrastructures of our businesses, or errors in the delivery of services may make our businesses’ services unavailable to their customers, may cause disruptions in such customers’ operations and may cause such customers to suffer other harm. Because those customers use our businesses’ services to manage important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our businesses’ services could adversely impact our companies’ customers’ businesses. If there are any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our businesses’ services, our businesses’ customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment, our businesses could lose future sales, or their customers could make warranty claims against them, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable, or costly litigation or the payment of damages. Claims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party may require us to incur significant costs, enter into royalty or licensing agreements or develop or license substitute technology.Our businesses may be subject to claims that the technologies in their products and services infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. In addition, the vendors providing our businesses with technology for use in their technology could become subject to similar infringement claims. Although we believe that our businesses’ software and services do not infringe any intellectual property or other proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that such software and services do not, or that they will not in the future, infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights held by others. Any claims of infringement could cause our businesses to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is without merit, and could distract management from their business. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require our businesses to pay substantial amounts, or obtain a license to continue to use the software and services that are the subject of the claim, and/or otherwise restrict or prohibit our businesses’ use of the technology. There can be no assurance that our businesses would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms from the third party asserting any particular claim, or that they would be able to successfully develop alternative technology on a timely basis, or that they would be able to obtain a license from another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit them to continue offering, and their customers to continue using, the products and services. In addition, our businesses generally provide in their customer agreements for certain products and services that they will indemnify their customers against third-party infringement claims relating to technology they provide to those customers, which could obligate our businesses to pay damages if the products and services were found to be infringing. Infringement claims asserted against our businesses, our vendors or our businesses’ customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.Third-party attempts to breach our businesses’ networks or data security, or the existence of any other security vulnerabilities, could damage the reputation of our businesses and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Network and data security is particularly important for cloud-based software businesses, such as ours, which use Internet-based computing, storage, and connectivity technology to deliver their software products and services. Customers using our businesses’ products and services rely on the security of computer networks and infrastructure for achieving reliable service and the protection of their data. As part of our businesses’ subscription services, our businesses receive sensitive data. There can be no assurance that this information will not be subject to computer break-ins, theft and other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of information handled by our businesses’ products and services or cause interruptions in the operations of our businesses. Any such breach in security could expose us or our businesses to litigation, loss of customers, reputational damage and other business harm. We devote significant resources and incur significant costs to protect against security threats. Despite those efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities could cause us and our businesses to incur significant additional costs to alleviate problems caused by any such actual or perceived vulnerabilities. Those costs could reduce our operating margins and expose us and our businesses to litigation, loss of customers, reputational damage and other business harm. Our GovDelivery business depends heavily on contracts with the United States federal government. Those contracts could be materially reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the government’s continuing assessment of priorities, changes in government priorities or budget cuts. Those matters and/or delays in the budget process could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 9 Our GovDelivery business derives the majority of its revenue from U.S. federal government customers; we expect that the business will continue to derive most of its sales from work performed under U.S. government contracts, which are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. The programs in which our GovDelivery business participates must compete with other programs and policy imperatives for consideration during the budget and appropriation process. Concerns about increased deficit spending, along with continued economic challenges, continue to place pressure on U.S. and international government-customer budgets. While we believe that our GovDelivery business’ programs are well aligned with the missions of our U.S. government customers, shifts in domestic spending, the affordability of GovDelivery’s products and services, general economic conditions and developments, and other factors may affect a decision to fund, or the level of funding, for existing or proposed contracts between GovDelivery and its U.S. federal government customers. Our MSDSonline business provides its customers with cloud-based software to help them comply with federal employee health and safety regulations. If the federal government were to reduce the amount of regulation related to employee health and safety, it could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Our MSDSonline business provides cloud-based software that helps employers comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations related to employee health and safety. If the scope of OSHA’s regulation of employee health and safety were to decline or if OSHA were to reduce its enforcement efforts, MSDSonline’s customers and potential customers would be less likely purchase MSDSonline’s products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Our Bolt business derives a meaningful portion of its revenue from commissions, which are dependent on premium rates charged by a limited number of insurance companies that can be difficult to predict.In addition to its cloud software business, Bolt is engaged in insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, and insurance programs businesses, and, as such, derives a meaningful portion of its revenue from commissions paid by a limited number of insurance companies. Commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products. The amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by a limited number of insurance companies. Bolt does not determine insurance premiums. Premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market. Historically, property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions. As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as Bolt, those insurance companies may seek to further reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to such insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may adversely affect Bolt’s profitability and financial condition. Because Bolt does not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it may not be able to accurately forecast its commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline.Because our Bolt business competes with certain of its customers and potential customers with respect to its provision of insurance products and services, such customers and potential customers may be unwilling to enter into contract with our Bolt business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Bolt provides a cloud-based platform used by insurance carriers, insurance agents and consumers. Some of Bolt’s offerings may compete with offerings of insurance carriers that are existing customers or potential customers, and these insurance carriers could decide not to use the Bolt platform, which could affect Bolt’s ability to execute on its strategy and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our businesses are experiencing relatively rapid growth. If we fail to effectively manage that growth, our businesses and operating results could be harmed. As a general matter, our businesses have experienced and are expected to continue to experience relatively rapid growth in terms of headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our and our businesses’ combined management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we and our businesses do not effectively manage that growth, the quality of our businesses’ cloud-based software and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our brands and operating results. The potential expansion of some of our businesses into international markets would heighten those risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting businesses in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute resolution systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. To effectively manage growth, we and our businesses will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management processes. Those systems enhancements and improvements may require additional capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement those improvements could hurt our ability to manage the growth of our businesses and our financial position. 10 Fluctuations in our quarterly results and our inability to meet financial guidance may adversely affect our stock price. Our investors are increasingly evaluating our company based on our quarterly performance against stated financial targets. If our operating results in one or more quarters do not meet our stated financial guidance or our securities analysts’ or investors’ expectations, the price of our stock could decrease. We expect that our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly due to many factors, including: general economic conditions, including economic downturns or uncertainty; the timing of customer signings and implementations at our businesses; the pace of development or a decline in growth of cloud-based software and services markets; competition for the products and services offered by our businesses. our acquisition of interests in new businesses; the operating results, including growth rates, of our businesses; changes in our estimated quarterly revenue, earnings and other performance metrics; andchanges in the accounting methods that we use to account for our interests in businesses that may result from changes in our ownership percentages in those businesses. If we are not able to consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business strategy. Our business strategy of owning and operating majority-owned, cloud-based technology software and services businesses in various vertical markets may, from time to time, require (1) the ability to strategically acquire new businesses on favorable terms and (2) the ability to strategically consummate “tuck-in” acquisitions at our existing businesses on favorable terms. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates that fit our business strategies. Furthermore, even if we are able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, it may not be possible or prudent to acquire interests in certain of those companies because of the robust valuations being ascribed to cloud-based software businesses at the present time, or due to competition from other potential acquirers that may have greater resources, brand name recognition, industry contacts or flexibility of structure than we do. If we are unable to effectively deploy capital for acquisitions on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute on our strategy, and our business may be adversely impacted. Acquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. As part of our business growth strategies, our existing businesses have acquired, and may continue to acquire, other companies, businesses and technologies. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology involves numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, administrative systems, technologies, services and products of the acquired company or business and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular acquisition transaction, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness and other expenses for our businesses. Accordingly, difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Entering new vertical markets through acquisitions could adversely affect our operating results. We intend to acquire businesses in new vertical markets that we believe can be transformed through the adoption of cloud-based technologies. If the vertical markets that ultimately enter are not receptive to cloud-based solutions or potential customers in such markets choose to adopt solutions provided by our competitors, including providers of horizontal-based solutions, our operating results could be adversely affected. We may make acquisitions that do not meet our financial or strategic expectations, which could adversely affect our operating results. We face competition for potential acquisition targets and may need to pay purchase prices reflective of high valuations to acquire attractive cloud-based technology companies. Such acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt and could fail to meet our financial or strategic expectations and/or to justify such valuations, which could adversely affect our operating results. 11 Our consummation of acquisitions could have negative accounting consequences. A significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If we consummate acquisitions that do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The operations and growth of our businesses could be impaired by the inability to raise capital or borrow money on favorable terms. The operations and growth (both organic and acquisitions-based) of our businesses may require additional capital. If we or our businesses are unable to raise capital or obtain credit on favorable terms, the ability of our businesses to operate and grow may be impaired. This may require us to take other actions, such as borrowing money on terms that may be unfavorable, or divesting of assets prematurely to raise capital. If we need capital for our businesses and are unable to raise it, our businesses may need to limit or cease operations. Execution of our acquisitions strategy may result in a depletion of our cash.Our strategy may, from time to time, call for us to acquire new cloud-based software and services businesses. Acquiring a controlling equity stake in a cloud-based software or services company with the strong financial characteristics and growth potential necessitated by our strategy would likely require a significant amount of capital. Deploying large amounts of capital to acquire one or more companies could lead to a depletion of our available cash and could require us to borrow money, issue stock or otherwise raise additional capital, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all. Ownership in our consolidated businesses by such businesses’ management teams could negatively impact our ability to execute our strategy if our interests are not aligned with management. One aim of our business strategy is to maintain significant majority ownership positions in our most promising and mature businesses, ideally owning such businesses solely with such businesses’ management teams. Because we believe that it is important that the key managers of our businesses own stakes in such businesses, when we acquire a new consolidated business we typically encourage its key managers to roll their equity ownership into equity of the surviving business. Additionally, each of our consolidated businesses maintains equity incentive plans for its employees. We seek to align our interests with management of our businesses through equity ownership and believe that, particularly when management holds the same security as us, such alignment is likely. The ownership of equity interests by company managers who have different financial and strategic goals or hold different securities than us, however, could have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business strategy. Minority stockholders of our consolidated businesses could attempt to limit our ability to control our businesses, which could have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business strategy. Management of our consolidated businesses, and in the case of Bolt, other minority stockholders of Bolt, could have financial or business interests or objectives that are different from ours and could seek to limit our ability to control our actions with respect that business, particularly in connection with capital-raising activities, which could have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business strategy. If we cannot, or choose not to, extract cash from our businesses, it could have a negative impact on our liquidity position and operations. One of our goals is to help our businesses achieve profitability so that we can access their cash flow. All of our businesses may not meet that goal; even if they do, in lieu of issuing dividends, we may choose to reinvest cash in our businesses’ for operations, including for investment in product development and sales and market, tuck-in acquisitions. If we do not access cash from our businesses it could have a negative impact on our future liquidity position and operations. Our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis in our businesses could change materially in the near term. Our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis, including goodwill, in our businesses could change in the near term, and the effect of those changes on our consolidated financial statements could be significant. It is possible that a significant write-down or write-off of our carrying basis in our businesses, including goodwill, may be required in the future, or that a significant loss will be recorded in the future upon the sale of one or more businesses. Any write-down or write-off of this type could cause a decline in the price of our stock. 12 Changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations. Financial accounting standards may change or their interpretation may change. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change becomes effective. Changes to existing rules or the re-examining of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Numerous external forces, including generally weak and/or uncertain economic and political conditions could result in declines in our revenue and operating results. Numerous external forces beyond our control, including generally weak and/or uncertain economic and political conditions, could result in future declines in our revenue and operating results. Adverse or uncertain financial and political conditions could cause customers and potential customers of our businesses to forgo, delay or reduce the amount of cloud-based software and services that they purchase, extend our business sales cycles, create difficulties in collecting (or the inability to collect) accounts receivable, lead to slower adoption of new technologies, result in increased price competition and/or make it difficult or impossible for our businesses to obtain financing. Our stock price has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile in the future. Our stock price has historically had a higher than average volatility. This volatility may continue in the future, particularly in light of the uncertainty that has characterized the global economy in recent years. The following factors, among others, may add to the volatility in the price of our stock: general economic conditions, including economic downturns or uncertainty; the reluctance of potential customers to use cloud-based solutions or spend on non-core products and services; actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results; changes in the market valuations of our businesses and other cloud-based technology businesses; conditions or trends related to cloud-based technology businesses; changes by securities analysts regarding their expectations of our performance; new products or services offered by our businesses and their competitors; announcements by our businesses or their competitors of technological innovations; announcements by us, our businesses or our businesses’ competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; additional sales or repurchases of our securities or the securities of our businesses; and additions to or departures of our key personnel. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Any of these factors may decrease the price of our stock. We have had a general history of operating losses and may experience operating losses in the future. Historically we have had significant operating losses, excluding the effect of any non-operating gains, such as from the sale of interests in our businesses. We can give no assurances as to whether we will achieve profitability and, even if we do achieve profits, we may not be able to sustain them in the future. Our businesses have relatively limited operating histories and may never be profitable. Our businesses have relatively limited operating histories to aid in assessing future prospects. Further, some of our businesses have significant historical losses and may never be profitable. Our businesses have incurred substantial costs to develop and market their products and expand operations and have incurred net losses; we intend to continue to spend substantial amounts on product development and sales and marketing for our business. The operating expenses of these businesses could increase in the foreseeable future as they continue to develop products, increase sales and marketing efforts and expand operations, and there can be no assurance that such increased expenses will ultimately result in increased revenues. 13 We and our businesses may be subject to litigation proceedings that could disrupt and harm our businesses. We and our businesses may be subject to legal claims involving stockholder, consumer, competition and other matters. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting one or more of our businesses from performing a critical activity, such as selling its software and services. If we or one of our businesses were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a litigation matter, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. Even if legal claims brought against us or our businesses are without merit, defending lawsuits could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert our or our businesses’ management attention from other business concerns. We and our businesses may be subject to government regulation that could disrupt and harm our businesses. The software and services offerings of our businesses are subject to government regulation domestically and internationally in many areas, including regulation of the Internet regarding user privacy, telecommunications, data protection and online content. The application of those laws and regulations to our businesses is often unclear and sometimes may conflict. Compliance with those laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. Our Bolt business operates in the heavily regulated insurance market and, as such is also subject to state regulation with to its insurance operations. Noncompliance by our businesses with applicable regulations could result in monetary penalties being imposed on our businesses or orders that our businesses cease performing a critical activity, such as selling their software and services or, in the case of Bolt, providing insurance services. We have implemented certain anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation and bylaws, including supermajority voting requirements and the inability of our stockholders to call stockholder meetings or act by written consent, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our amended certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and also provides for a staggered board of directors. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
