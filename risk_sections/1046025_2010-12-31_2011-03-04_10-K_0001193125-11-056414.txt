Risk FactorsOur loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of lossOur Real estate construction and land development loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Origination and Sales of Residential Mortgage Loans Consistent with our asset/liability management strategy, we sell a significant portion of our residential mortgage loans to the secondary market. Commitments to sell mortgage loans generally are made during the period between the taking of the loan application and the closing of the mortgage loan. Most of these sale commitments are made on a best efforts basis whereby we are only obligated to sell the mortgage if the mortgage loan is approved and closed. As a result, management believes that market risk is minimal. In addition, some of our mortgage loan production is brokered to other lenders prior to funding. When we sell mortgage loans, we typically sell the servicing of the loans (i.e., collection of principal and interest payments). However, we serviced $115,000, $131,000, and $233,000 in mortgage loans for others as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. We received fee income for servicing activities on mortgage loans of $0, $1,000, and $1,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table presents summary information concerning our origination and sale of residential mortgage loans and the gains achieved on such activities. Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Residential mortgage loans: Originated $ 18,605 $ 16,981 $ 16,177 $ 4,963 $ 8,593 Sold 16,125 16,460 16,320 4,516 8,856 Gains on sales of loans, net $ 226 $ 288 $ 265 $ 64 $ 133 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit that are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we use in all our lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments. 7 Table of Contents The following table presents outstanding commitments to extend credit, including letters of credit, at the indicated date. December 31,2010 (In thousands) Commercial business: Commercial and industrial $ 147,022 Owner-occupied commercial real estate 2,977 Non-owner occupied commercial real estate 6,712 Total commercial business 156,711 One-to-four family residential 44 Real estate construction and land development: One-to-four family residential 3,542 Five or more family residential and commercial properties 11,595 Total real estate construction and land development 15,137 Consumer 40,640 Total outstanding commitments $ 212,532 Delinquencies and Nonperforming Assets Delinquency Procedures. We send a borrower a delinquency notice 15 days after the due date when the borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan. If the delinquency is not brought current, additional delinquency notices are mailed at 30 and 45 days for commercial loans. Additional written and oral contacts are made with the borrower between 60 and 90 days after the due date. If a real estate loan payment is past due for 45 days or more, the collection manager may perform a review of the condition of the property if suspect. We may negotiate and accept a repayment program with the borrower, accept a voluntary deed in lieu of foreclosure or, when considered necessary, begin foreclosure proceedings. If foreclosed on, real property is sold at a public sale and we bid on the property to protect our interest. A decision as to whether and when to begin foreclosure proceedings is based on such factors as the amount of the outstanding loan in relation to the value of the property securing the original indebtedness, the extent of the delinquency, and the borrowers ability and willingness to cooperate in resolving the delinquency. Real estate acquired by us is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the estimated fair value (less costs to sell) at the date of acquisition, not to exceed net realizable value, and any resulting write-down is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Upon acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of the propertys net realizable value. Delinquencies in the commercial business loan portfolio are handled on a case-by-case basis. Generally, notices are sent and personal contact is made with the borrower when the loan is 15 days past due. Loan officers are responsible for collecting loans they originate or which are assigned to them. Depending on the nature of the loan and the type of collateral securing the loan, we may negotiate and accept a modified payment program or take other actions as circumstances warrant. Classification of Loans. Federal regulations require that our banks periodically evaluate the risks inherent in their respective loan portfolios. In addition, the Division of Banks of the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (Division) and the FDIC have authority to identify problem loans and, if appropriate, require them to be reclassified. There are three classifications for problem loans: Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. Substandard loans have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility 8 Table of Contents that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful loans have the weaknesses of Substandard loans, with additional characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values questionable. There is a high possibility of loss in loans classified as Doubtful. A loan classified as Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a loan of the institution is not warranted. If a loan or a portion of the loan is classified as Loss, the institution must charge-off this amount. We also have loans we classify as Watch and Other Assets Especially Mentioned (OAEM). Loans classified as Watch are performing assets but have elements of risk that require more monitoring than other performing loans. Loans classified as OAEM are assets that continue to perform but have shown deterioration in credit quality and require close monitoring. The Banks routinely test their problem loans for potential impairment. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Banks will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Problem loans that may be impaired are identified using the Banks normal loan review procedures, which include post-approval reviews, monthly reviews by credit administration of criticized loan reports, scheduled internal reviews, underwriting during extensions and renewals and the analysis of information routinely received on a borrowers financial performance. Impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loans effective interest rate, unless the loan is collateral dependent, in which case impairment is measured using the fair value of the collateral after deducting appropriate collateral disposition costs. Furthermore, when it is practically expedient, impairment is measured by the fair market price of the loan. Subsequent to an initial measure of impairment, if there is a significant change in the amount or timing of a loans expected future cash flows or a change in the value of collateral or market price of a loan, based on new information received, the impairment is recalculated. However, the net carrying value of a loan never exceeds the recorded investment in the loan. 9 Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets. Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, and other real estate owned. The following table provides information about our originated nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, and other real estate owned for the indicated dates. At December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Nonaccrual originated loans: Commercial business $ 10,839 $ 9,728 $ 1,176 $ 33 $ 2,801 One-to-four family residential properties 2     Real estate construction and land development 15,642 25,108 2,221 949  Consumer    39 6 Total nonaccrual originated loans(1)(2) 26,483 34,836 3,397 1,021 2,807 Restructured originated loans: One-to-four family residential 394 425    Total restructured originated loans 394 425    Total nonperforming originated loans 26,877 35,261 3,397 1,021 2,807 Other real estate owned 3,030 704 2,031 169 225 Total nonperforming originated assets $ 29,907 $ 35,965 $ 5,428 $ 1,190 $ 3,032 Accruing originated loans past due 90 days or more $ 1,221 $ 277 $ 664 $ 2,084 $  Potential problem originated loans(3) $ 56,088 $ 53,086 $ 43,061 $ 22,023 $ 5,509 Allowance for loan losses $ 22,062 $ 26,164 $ 15,423 $ 10,374 $ 10,105 Nonperforming originated loans to total originated loans(4) 3.19 % 4.27 % 0.42 % 0.13 % 0.37 % Allowance for loan losses to total originated loans 2.97 % 3.38 % 1.91 % 1.33 % 1.35 % Allowance for loan losses to nonperforming originated loans(4) 93.16 % 79.34 % 454.02 % 1,016.06 % 360.05 % Nonperforming originated assets to total originated assets(4) 2.41 % 3.32 % 0.57 % 0.13 % 0.36 % (1) $9.1 million and $17.0 million of nonaccrual loans were considered troubled debt restructures at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no troubled debt restructures at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. (2) $3.2 million and $2.3 million of nonaccrual loans were guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. (3) $5.9 million and $7.2 million of potential problem originated loans were guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. (4) Excludes portions guaranteed by government agencies. Nonaccrual Loans. Our financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, including the recognition of interest income on our loan portfolio, unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Loans are considered to be impaired and are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest. Our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes past due for 90 days or more, is less than fully collateralized, and is not in the process of collection. Amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected. The decrease of $8.4 million in nonaccrual originated loans at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 was primarily attributable to $16.7 million in charge-offs of which $8.1 million related to nonperforming commercial business loans and $8.3 million related to nonperforming construction loans. 10 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, our largest originated nonaccrual relationship to one borrower had nonaccrual loans in the amount of $8.3 million. These loans, which were placed on nonaccrual status in 2009, are to a builder/developer of single family homes/lots primarily in Pierce County, Washington. Pierce County has had a significant slowdown in home sales and this slowdown has affected the borrowers ability to sell lots and repay the loans as originally planned. We believe we are adequately reserved for these loans at this time. At December 31, 2010, our second largest originated nonaccrual relationship to one borrower had nonaccrual loans in the amount of $5.9 million. The loans, which were categorized as potential problem loans at December 31, 2009, are to a builder/developer of a condominium project in Pierce County, Washington. While the Company has appraisals which justify current carrying values, these loans were placed on nonaccrual status due to the slow rate at which the individual units are selling. While at this time we believe we have adequately reserved for these loans, should property values continue to deteriorate, additional loss provisions may be necessary. Troubled Debt Restructures. Loans where the terms have been modified in order to grant a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty are identified as a Troubled Debt Restructures (TDRs). TDRs are considered impaired and are reported as such. At December 31, 2010 we had $9.1 million of TDRs. Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans are those loans that are currently accruing interest and are not considered impaired, but which we are monitoring because the financial information of the borrower causes us concerns as to their ability to comply with their loan repayment terms. Loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are both well secured and in the process of collection. Potential problem loans increased $3.5 million to $56.6 million at December 31, 2010 from $53.1 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in potential problem loans was primarily due to one credit relationship totaling $9.6 million consisting of multifamily and other commercial real estate loans that was downgraded during the year ended December 31, 2010. Analysis of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Management maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) to provide for estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the ALLL is monitored through our ongoing quarterly loan quality assessments. We assess the estimated credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio by considering a number of elements including:  Historical loss experience in a number of homogeneous segments of the loan portfolio;  The impact of environmental factors, including:  Levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans;  Levels and trends in charge-offs and recoveries;  Effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices;  Experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;  National and local economic trends and conditions;  External factors such as competition, legal, and regulatory; and  Effects of changes in credit concentrations. We calculate an adequate ALLL for the non-classified and classified performing loans in our loan portfolio by applying historical loss factors for homogeneous segments of the portfolio, adjusted for changes to the above- 11 Table of Contents noted environmental factors. We may record specific provisions for impaired loans, including loans on nonaccrual status and TDRs, after a careful analysis of each loans credit and collateral factors. Our analysis of an adequate ALLL combines the provisions made for our non-classified loans, classified loans, and the specific provisions made for each impaired loan. While we believe we use the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses, results of operations could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance. A further decline in local and national economic conditions, or other factors, could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the Companys financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. The following table provides information regarding changes in our allowance for loan losses for the indicated periods: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Total originated loans outstanding at end of period(1) $ 742,019 $ 772,247 $ 808,726 $ 779,319 $ 749,701 Average total originated loans outstanding during period(1) $ 717,159 $ 787,527 $ 795,752 $ 778,058 $ 690,287 Allowance balance at beginning of period $ 26,164 $ 15,423 $ 10,374 $ 10,105 $ 8,496 Provision for loan losses 11,990 19,390 7,420 810 720 Allowance acquired through acquisition     749 Charge-offs: Commercial business (8,106 ) (2,668 ) (144 ) (412 ) (78 ) One-to-four family residential (169 ) (189 ) (280 ) (67 ) (3 ) Real estate construction and land development (8,344 ) (5,774 ) (1,818 )   Consumer (73 ) (192 ) (165 ) (94 ) (83 ) Total charge-offs (16,692 ) (8,823 ) (2,407 ) (573 ) (164 ) Recoveries: Commercial business 243 1 1 2 255 One-to-four family residential 15 1  5 24 Real estate construction and land development 285 50    Consumer 57 122 35 25 25 Total recoveries 600 174 36 32 304 Net (charge-offs) recoveries (16,092 ) (8,649 ) (2,371 ) (541 ) 140 Allowance balance at end of period $ 22,062 $ 26,164 $ 15,423 $ 10,374 $ 10,105 Ratio of net (charge-offs) recoveries during period to average total originated loans outstanding (2.24 )% (1.10 )% (0.30 )% (0.06 )% 0.02 % (1) Excludes loans held for sale. 12 Table of Contents The following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the indicated periods. The allocation is based upon an evaluation of defined loan problems, historical loan loss ratios, and industry wide and other factors that affect loan losses in the categories shown below: At December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Amount % ofTotalLoans(1) Amount % ofTotalLoans(1) Amount % ofTotalLoans(1) Amount(2) % ofTotalLoans(1) Amount % ofTotalLoans(1) (Dollars in thousands) Commercial business $ 14,329 65.0 % $ 12,137 46.4 % $ 2,785 50.7 % $ 1,999 49.5 % $ 7,276 48.7 % Real estate construction 5,449 24.7 12,892 49.3 6,587 16.1 3,839 15.8 585 15.7 Real estate other 799 3.6 550 2.1 5,797 30.6 4,231 32.6 2,106 33.9 Consumer 554 2.5 361 1.4 254 2.6 305 2.1 138 1.7 Unallocated 931 4.2 224 0.8  0.0  0.0  0.0 Total loans $ 22,062 100.0 % $ 26,164 100.0 % $ 15,423 100.0 % $ 10,374 100.0 % $ 10,105 100.0 % (1) Represents the total of all outstanding loans in each category as a percent of total loans outstanding. (2) The Company historically allocated its allowance for loan losses based on the percentages noted in (1) above, however, in 2008, management reclassified 2007 amounts to be consistent with the 2008 allowance for loan losses allocation method which, is based on qualitative and quantitative factors determined for each loan category. Investment Activities At December 31, 2010, our investment securities portfolio totaled $138.9 million, which consisted of $125.1 million of securities available for sale and $13.8 million of securities held to maturity. This compares with a total portfolio of $104.4 million at December 31, 2009, which was comprised of $90.7 million of securities available for sale and $13.6 million of securities held to maturity. The increase in the investment portfolio was substantially due to the acquisitions of Cowlitz Bank and Pierce Commercial Bank. The composition of the two investment portfolios by type of security, at each respective date, is presented in Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At June 30, 2008, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $1.1 million related to its $9.6 million investment in the AMF Ultra Short Mortgage Fund (the Fund). The net asset value of the Fund had declined primarily as a result of the uncertainty in spreads in the bond market for private label mortgage-related securities and credit downgrades to a small percentage of the underlying securities. In July 2008, the Company redeemed its 1,080,114 shares in the Fund for $1.6 million in cash and securities with a fair value of $7.9 million. This redemption resulted in a loss of $96,000. The securities received, which were mortgage-backed securities and private residential collateralized mortgage obligations, were classified as held to maturity as the Company had the positive intent and ability to hold these securities until they matured. In December 2008, as a result of continued declines in market value and credit downgrades of specific securities acquired in the redemption, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge of $668,000 on private residential collateralized mortgage obligations with a carrying value of $856,000 and a fair value of $188,000. In total during 2008, the Company recorded losses of $1.9 million related to the Fund and the securities received in the redemption of the shares in the Fund. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 320-10-65, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments, which provides for the bifurcation of other-than-temporary impairments into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit loss) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors. As a result of adopting FASB ASC 320-10-65, the Company recorded $830,000 in impairments on private collateralized mortgage obligations not related to credit losses through other comprehensive income 13 Table of Contents rather than through earnings and $500,000 in impairments related to credit losses through earnings during the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company also reclassified $229,000 from retained earnings to other comprehensive income related to impairment charges on private residential collateralized mortgage obligations at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009 that were not due to credit losses. The activity related to the amount of other-than-temporary impairments related to credit losses on held to maturity securities during the year ended December 31, 2010, is presented in Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our investment policy is established by the Board of Directors and monitored by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. It is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complements our Banks lending activities. The policy dictates the criteria for classifying securities as either available for sale or held to maturity. The policy permits investment in various types of liquid assets permissible under applicable regulations, which include U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Government agency obligations, some certificates of deposit of insured banks, mortgage backed and mortgage related securities, some corporate notes, municipal bonds, and federal funds. Investment in non-investment grade bonds and stripped mortgage backed securities are not permitted under the policy.

The Banks are required to maintain an investment in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Seattle in an amount equal to the greater of $500,000 or 0.50% of residential mortgage loans and pass-through securities or an advance requirement to be confirmed on the date of the advance and 5.0% of the outstanding balance of mortgage loans sold to the FHLB of Seattle. At December 31, 2010 the Banks were required to maintain an investment in the stock of FHLB of Seattle of at least $1.5 million. At December 31, 2010 the Banks had an investment in FHLB stock carried at a cost basis (par value) of $5.6 million. 15 Table of Contents The Company evaluated its investment in FHLB of Seattle stock for other-than-temporary impairment, consistent with its accounting policy. Based on the Companys evaluation of the underlying investment, including the long-term nature of the investment, the liquidity position of the FHLB of Seattle, the actions being taken by the FHLB of Seattle to address its regulatory situation and the Companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the par value, the Company did not recognize an other-than-temporary impairment loss on its FHLB of Seattle stock. Even though the Company did not recognize an other-than-temporary impairment loss on its FHLB of Seattle stock during the year ended December 31, 2010, continued deterioration in the FHLB of Seattles financial position may result in future impairment losses. Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds General. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, loan repayments and borrowings. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposits and unscheduled loan prepayments, which are influenced significantly by general interest rate levels, interest rates available on other investments, competition, economic conditions, and other factors are not. Customer deposits remain an important source of funding, but these balances have been influenced in the past by adverse market conditions in the industry and may be affected by future developments such as interest rate fluctuations and new competitive pressures. In addition to customer deposits management may utilize the use of brokered deposits on an as-needed basis. Borrowings may also be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds (such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels). Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities and match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets. In addition the Company began to utilize repurchase agreements as a supplement to other funding sources during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31 2010, non-maturity deposits (total deposits less certificate of deposit accounts) increased $197.1 million, or 36.8%. As a result, the percentage of certificate of deposit accounts to total deposits decreased to 35.5% from 36.2% at December 31, 2009. A significant reason for the change in mix of deposit accounts is attributable to the acquisition of Cowlitz Bank and Pierce Commercial Bank. Deposit Activities. We offer a variety of deposit accounts designed to attract both short-term and long-term deposits. These accounts include certificates of deposit (CDs), regular savings accounts, money market accounts, checking and negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). These accounts generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and managements desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits. The more significant deposit accounts are described below. Certificates of Deposit. We offer several types of CDs with maturities ranging from three months to five years, which require a minimum deposit of $2,500. Negotiable CDs are offered in amounts of $100,000 or more for terms of 30 days to 12 months. Regular Savings Accounts. We offer savings accounts that allow for unlimited deposits and withdrawals, provided that a $100 minimum balance is maintained. Money Market Accounts. Money market accounts pay a variable interest rate that is tiered depending on the balance maintained in the account. Minimum opening balances vary. Checking and NOW Accounts. Checking and NOW accounts are noninterest and interest bearing, and may be charged service fees based on activity and balances. NOW accounts pay interest, but require a higher minimum balance to avoid service charges. Individual Retirement Accounts. Individual Retirement Accounts permit annual contributions regulated by law and pay interest at fixed rates. Maturities are available from one to five years. 16 Table of Contents Sources of Funds The following table provides the average balances outstanding and the weighted average interest rates for each major category of deposits for the years ended December 31: 2010 2009 2008 AverageBalance AverageRatePaid AverageBalance AverageRatePaid AverageBalance AverageRatePaid (Dollars in thousands) Interest bearing demand and money market accounts $ 376,245 0.58 % $ 310,860 0.89 % $ 243,082 1.78 % Savings 89,978 0.56 85,541 0.98 92,648 1.70 Certificates of deposit 351,191 1.62 323,696 2.47 343,642 3.62 Total interest bearing deposits 817,414 1.02 720,097 1.61 679,372 2.70 Non interest demand deposits 150,906  120,107  108,386  Total deposits $ 968,320 0.87 % $ 840,204 1.38 % $ 787,758 2.32 % The following table shows the amount and maturity of certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Remaining maturity: Three months or less $ 78,260 Over three months through six months 34,263 Over six months through twelve months 54,832 Over twelve months 60,626 Total $ 227,981 Borrowings. Deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and our general business purposes. We rely upon advances from the FHLB to supplement our supply of lendable funds and meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The FHLB of Seattle serves as one of our secondary sources of liquidity. Advances from the FHLB of Seattle are typically secured by our first lien single family mortgage loans, multifamily mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans and stock issued by the FHLB, which is owned by us. At December 31, 2010, the Banks maintained an uncommitted credit facility with the FHLB of Seattle for $173.1 million and an uncommitted credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for $66.9 million, of which there were no advances or borrowings outstanding. The Banks also maintain advance lines with Key Bank, US Bank and Pacific Coast Bankers Bank to purchase federal funds up to $22.8 million as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010 we had securities sold under agreement to repurchase of $19.0 million which were secured by available for sale investment securities. The FHLB functions provides credit for member financial institutions. As members, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States) provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institutions net worth or on the FHLBs assessment of the institutions creditworthiness. Under its current credit policies, the FHLB of Seattle limits advances to 20% of assets for Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank. 17 Table of Contents The following table is a summary of FHLB advances for the years ended December 31: 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Balance at period end $  $  $  Average balance during the period 1,330  6,223 Maximum amount outstanding at any month end 17,486  17,100 Average interest rate: During the period 1.67 %  2.91 % At period end    There were no federal funds purchased for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. During 2006, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Key Bank in the amount of $3.7 million. The terms of the loan included quarterly payments of $345,000, interest at 6.8% and maturing July 2009. The loan was paid off during the year ended December 31, 2008. Supervision and Regulation We are subject to extensive Federal and Washington State legislation, regulation, and supervision. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, the FDIC and shareholders. The laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies have changed significantly over recent years, and it is reasonable to expect that similar changes will continue in the future. Most recently, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted on July 21, 2010, which will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure. See Other Regulatory DevelopmentsThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 herein for a discussion of this new legislation. Any change in applicable laws, regulations, or regulatory policies may have a material effect on our business, operations, and prospects. We cannot predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that any fiscal or monetary policies or new Federal or State legislation may have in the future. The following information is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described. Heritage Financial. We are subject to regulation as a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and are supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). The Federal Reserve has the authority to order bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsound practices and violations of conditions imposed on them. The Federal Reserve is also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies and individuals who violate the Bank Holding Company Act or orders or regulations thereunder in amounts up to $1.0 million per day. The Federal Reserve may order termination of non-banking activities by non-banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies, or divestiture of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company. Some violations may also result in criminal penalties. The FDIC is authorized to exercise comparable authority under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and other statutes for state nonmember banks such as Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial distress. A bank holding companys failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserves regulations or both. The Dodd-Frank 18 Table of Contents Act requires new regulations to be projulgated concerning the source of strength. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires an undercapitalized bank to develop a capital restoration plan, approved by the FDIC, with a guaranty by each company having control of the bank, of the banks compliance with the plan. We are required to file annual and periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and provide additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine us, and any of our subsidiaries, and charge us for the cost of the examination. We, and any subsidiaries which we may control, are considered affiliates within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between our bank subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, we and our subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various products or services, such as extensions of credit, to other products or services offered by us, or our affiliates. Bank regulations require bank holding companies and banks to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of core capital to adjusted quarterly average total assets of at least 3%. In addition, banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines under which risk percentages are assigned to various categories of assets and off-balance sheet items to calculate a risk-adjusted capital ratio. Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stockholders equity (which does not include unrealized gains and losses on securities), less goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt, both subject to some limitations. Regulatory risk-based capital guidelines require Tier 1 capital of 4% of risk-adjusted assets and minimum total capital ratio (combined Tier 1 and Tier 2) of 8% of risk-adjusted assets. The Dodd-Frank Act requires new capital regulations to be adopted in final form 18 months after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (July 21, 2010). To date, no proposed regulations have been issued. Subsidiaries. Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank are Washington-chartered commercial banks, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC. Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank are subject to regulation by the FDIC and the Division of Banks of the Washington Department of Financial Institutions. Applicable Federal and State statutes and regulations which govern a banks operations relate to minimum capital requirements, required reserves against deposits, investments, loans, legal lending limits, mergers and consolidation, borrowings, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches, and other aspects of its operations, among other things. The Division and the FDIC also have authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what they consider to be unsafe and unsound practices. The Banks are required to file periodic reports with the FDIC and the Division, and are subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities. Based upon these evaluations, the regulators may revalue the assets of an institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the differences between the determined value and the book value of such assets. These examinations must be conducted every 12 months, except that well-capitalized banks may be examined every 18 months. The FDIC and the Division may each accept the results of an examination by the other in lieu of conducting an independent examination. Dividends paid by our subsidiaries provide substantially all of our cash flow. Applicable Federal and Washington State regulations restrict capital distributions by our Banks, including dividends. Such restrictions are tied to the institutions capital levels after giving effect to such distributions. Capital Adequacy. The Federal Reserve and FDIC have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banks. In addition, these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a bank holding company or bank maintain capital above the minimum levels, based on its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth. The Federal Reserves risk-based guidelines for bank holding companies establish a two-tier capital framework. Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stockholders equity (which does not include unrealized 19 Table of Contents gains and losses on securities), less goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt, both subject to some limitations. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital represents qualifying total capital, at least 50% of which must consist of Tier 1 capital. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing Tier 1 and total capital by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to one of four categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative credit risk. The minimum Tier 1 risk- based capital ratios under these guidelines at December 31, 2010 were 4% and 8%, respectively. At December 31, 2010, we had Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital of 20.2% and 21.5%, respectively. The Federal Reserves leverage capital guidelines establish a minimum leverage ratio determined by dividing Tier 1 capital by adjusted average total assets. The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%. At December 31, 2010, we had a leverage ratio of 13.9%. Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institutions category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework. Under these regulations, an institution is treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 10% or more, its ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets is 6% or more, its ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets (leverage ratio) is 5% or more, and it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level. In order to be adequately capitalized, an institution must have a total risk-based capital ratio of not less than 8%, a core capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of not less than 4%, and a leverage ratio of not less than 4%. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by either Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements. As of December 31, 2010, the Banks met the requirements to be classified as well-capitalized. Federal law generally bars institutions which are not well capitalized from soliciting or accepting brokered deposits bearing interest rates significantly higher than prevailing market rates. Deposit Insurance and Other FDIC Programs. The deposits of the Banks are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which is administered by the FDIC. The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits, up to applicable limits, of depository institutions. As insurer of the Banks deposits, the FDIC has supervisory and enforcement authority over Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank and this insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by institutions insured by the FDIC. It also may prohibit any institution insured by the FDIC from engaging in 20 Table of Contents any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the institution and the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on each FDIC-insured institution quarterly based on annualized rates for one of four risk categories applying these rates to the institutions deposits. Under rules in effect through March 31, 2011, each institution is assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital, supervisory ratings and other factors. Well capitalized institutions that are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses are assigned to Risk Category I. Risk Categories II, III and IV present progressively greater risks to the DIF. A range of initial base assessment rates applies to each Risk Category subject to adjustments based on an institutions unsecured debt, secured liabilities and brokered deposits, such that the total base assessment rates after adjustments range from 7 to 24 basis points for Risk Category I, 17 to 43 basis points for Risk Category II, 27 to 58 basis points for Risk Category III, and 40 to 77.5 basis points for Risk Category IV. Rates increase uniformly by three basis points effective January 1, 2011. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted rules effective April 1, 2011, under which insurance premium assessments are based on an institutions total assets minus its tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital) instead of its deposits. Under these rules, an institution with total assets of less than $10 billion will be assigned to a Risk Category as described above, and a range of initial base assessment rates will apply to each category, subject to adjustment downward based on unsecured debt issued by the institution and, except for an institution in Risk Category I, adjustment upward if the institutions brokered deposits exceed 10% of its domestic deposits, to produce total base assessment rates. Total base assessment rates range from 2.5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I, 9 to 24 basis points for Risk Category II, 18 to 33 basis points for Risk Category III, and 30 to 45 basis points for Risk Category IV, all subject to further adjustment upward if the institution holds more than a de minimis amount of unsecured debt issued by another FDIC-insured institution. The FDIC may increase or decrease its rates by 2.0 basis points without further rulemaking. In addition to the regular quarterly assessments, due to losses and projected losses attributed to failed institutions, the FDIC imposed a special assessment of five basis points on the amount of each depository institutions assets reduced by the amount of its Tier 1 capital (not to exceed 10 basis points of its assessment base for regular quarterly premiums) as of June 30, 2009, which was collected on September 30, 2009. As a result of a decline in the reserve ratio (the ratio of the net worth of the DIF to estimated insured deposits) and concerns about expected failure costs and available liquid assets in the DIF, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring each insured institution to prepay on December 30, 2009 the estimated amount of its quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and all quarters through the end of 2012 (in addition to the regular quarterly assessment for the third quarter due on December 30, 2009). The prepaid amount is recorded as an asset with a zero risk weight and the institution will continue to record quarterly expenses for deposit insurance. For purposes of calculating the prepaid amount, assessments are measured at the institutions assessment rate as of September 30, 2009, with a uniform increase of three basis points effective January 1, 2011, and are based on the institutions assessment base for the third quarter of 2009, with growth assumed quarterly at annual rate of 5%. If events cause actual assessments during the prepayment period to vary from the prepaid amount, institutions will pay excess assessments in cash, or receive a rebate of prepaid amounts not exhausted after collection of assessments due on June 13, 2013, as applicable. Collection of the prepayment does not preclude the FDIC from changing assessment rates or revising the risk-based assessment system in the future. The rule includes a process for exemption from the prepayment for institutions whose safety and soundness would be affected adversely. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes 1.35% as the minimum reserve ratio. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC has not yet announced how it will implement this offset. In addition to the statutory minimum ration, the FDIC must 21 Table of Contents designate a reserve ratio, known as the designated reserve ratio, or DRR, which may exceed the statutory minimum. The FDIC has established 2.0% as the DRR. In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the Federal government established to fund the costs of failed thrifts in the 1980s. For the quarterly period ended December 31, 2010, the Financing Corporation assessment equaled 1.04 basis points for each $100 in domestic deposits. These assessments, which may be revised based upon the level of DIF deposits, will continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019. Following a systemic risk determination, the FDIC established a Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) in October 2008. There are two parts to the program: the Debt Guarantee Program (DGP) and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP). Eligible entities generally are participants unless they exercised opt out rights in timely fashion. We and our bank subsidiaries did not opt out of these programs. For the DGP, eligible entities are generally U.S. bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, and FDIC-insured institutions. Under the DGP, the FDIC guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of an eligible entity that is issued not later than October 31, 2009. The guarantee is effective through the earlier of the maturity date or June 30, 2012 (for debt issued before April 1, 2009) or December 31, 2012 (for debt issued on or after April 1, 2009). The DGP coverage limit is generally 125% of the eligible entitys eligible debt outstanding on September 30, 2008 and scheduled to mature on or before June 30, 2009, or for certain institutions, 2% of liabilities as of September 30, 2008. The nonrefundable DGP fee ranges from 50 to 100 basis points (annualized), depending on maturity, for covered debt outstanding during the period until the earlier of maturity or June 30, 2012, with various surcharges of 10 to 50 basis points applicable to debt with a maturity of one year or more issued on or after April 1, 2009. Generally, eligible debt of a participating entity becomes covered when and as issued until the coverage limit is reached, except that under some circumstances, participating entities can issue certain nonguaranteed debt. Various features of the DGP require applications, additional fees, and approvals. For the TAGP, eligible entities are FDIC-insured institutions. Under the TAGP, the FDIC provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (typically business checking accounts), NOW accounts bearing interest at 0.5% or less, and certain funds swept into noninterest-bearing savings accounts. Other NOW accounts and money market deposit accounts are not covered. TAGP coverage lasts until December 31, 2009 and, unless the participant has opted out of the extension period, during the extension period of January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2010. While this was extended again through December 31, 2010, on September 27, 2010, the FDIC announced that it will not continue the TAGP beyond December 31, 2010. However, under the Dodd-Frank Act and the FDIC rules, separate temporary coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts and Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts, or IOLTA accounts, became effective on December 31, 2010, terminating on December 31, 2012, so that all funds held in such accounts are fully insured, without limit. Further, unlike the TAGP, all U.S. depository institutions insured by the FDIC must participate; there is no opt out provision. The FDIC does not plan to charge a separate assessment for the temporary insurance. Other Regulatory Developments. Significant federal banking legislation has been enacted in recent years. The following summarizes some of the recent significant federal banking legislation. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changes the current bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. 22 Table of Contents Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to have a near term impact on the Company. For example, effective one year after the date of enactment, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on the Companys interest expense. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments and authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a companys proxy materials. The legislation also directs the federal banking agencies to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive and risky compensation paid to bank and bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Financial institutions such as the Banks with $10 billion or less in assets will continued to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act includes certain provisions concerning capital regulations which are often referred to as the Collins Amendment. These provisions are intended to subject bank holding companies to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries and to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Under the Collins Amendment, trust preferred securities issued by a company with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion before May 19, 2010 and treated as regulatory capital are grandfathered, but any such securities issued later are not eligible as regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators must develop regulations setting minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for holding companies and banks on a consolidated basis that are no less stringent than the generally applicable requirements in effect for depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations discussed above. The banking regulators also must seek to make capital standards countercyclical so that the required levels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. The Act requires these new capital regulations to be adopted in final form 18 months after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (July 21, 2010). To date, no proposed regulations have been issued. It is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense. Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) was enacted. The EESA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to $700 billion in mortgage loans, mortgage-related securities and certain other financial instruments, including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program, or TARP. The purpose of TARP is to restore confidence and stability to the U.S. banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other. Under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, or CPP, the Treasury may purchase debt or equity securities from participating institutions. The TARP also allows direct purchases or guarantees of troubled assets of financial institutions. Participants in the CPP are subject to executive compensation limits and are encouraged to expand their lending and mortgage loan modifications. The Company completed its TARP 23 Table of Contents CPP transaction on November 21, 2008 and received $24 million in funding from the Treasury. In connection with its stock offering completed in September 2009, the Company reduced the number of shares of common stock underlying the Warrant issued to Treasury by 50% to 138,037 shares. In December 2010, the Company redeemed 24,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock and paid Treasury a total of $24.1 million, consisting of $24.0 million of principal and $123,000 of accrued and unpaid dividends. The Warrant is still held by the Treasury and remained outstanding at December 31, 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed ARRA into law. The ARRA is intended to revive the U.S. economy by creating millions of new jobs and stemming home foreclosures. For financial institutions that have received or will receive financial assistance under TARP or related programs, the ARRA significantly rewrites the original executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of Section 111 of the EESA. Among the most important changes instituted by the ARRA are new limits on the ability of TARP recipients to pay incentive compensation to up to 20 of the next most highly-compensated employees in addition to the senior executive officers, a restriction on termination of employment payments to senior executive officers and the five next most highly-compensated employees and a requirement that TARP recipients implement say on pay shareholder votes. Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was signed into law in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with various accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and corporate governance rules, requires the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Financial Services Reform Legislation. On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) was enacted into law. The GLBA removes various barriers imposed by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, specifically those prohibiting banks and bank holding companies from engaging in the securities and insurance business. The GLBA also expands the bank holding company act framework to permit bank holding companies with subsidiary banks meeting certain capital and management requirements to elect to become a financial holding company. Financial holding companies may engage in a full range of financial activities, including not only banking, insurance, and securities activities, but also merchant banking and additional activities determined to be financial in nature or complementary to an activity that is financial in nature. The GLBA also provides that the list of permissible financial activities will be expanded as necessary for a financial holding company to keep abreast of competitive and technological changes. In addition, the GLBA expands the activities in which insured state banks may engage. Under the GLBA, insured state banks are given the ability to engage in financial activities through a subsidiary, as long as the bank and its affiliates meet and comply with certain requirements. First, each bank must be well capitalized. Second, the bank must comply with certain capital deduction and financial statement requirements provided under the GLBA. Third, the bank must comply with certain financial and operational safeguards provided under the GLBA. Fourth, the bank must comply with the limits imposed by the GLBA on transactions with affiliates. 24 Table of Contents Website Access to Company Reports We post publicly available reports required to be filed with the SEC on our website, www.HF-WA.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the SEC. The required reports are available free of charge through our website. Code of Ethics We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and controller. We have posted the text of our code of ethics at www.HF-WA.com in the section titled Investor Information: Corporate Governance. Any waivers of the code of the ethics will be publicly disclosed to shareholders. Competition We compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage bankers, and other institutions in the scope and type of services offered, interest rates paid on deposits, pricing of loans, and number and locations of branches, among other things. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do. Particularly in times of high or rising interest rates, we also face significant competition for investors funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities. We compete for loans principally through the range and quality of the services we provide, interest rates and loan fees, and the locations of our Banks branches. We actively solicit deposit-related clients and compete for deposits by offering depositors a variety of savings accounts, checking accounts, cash management and other services. Employees We had 321 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2010. We experienced an increase of 99 full-time equivalent employees during 2010, mostly due to the acquisitions of Cowlitz Bank and Pierce Commercial Bank. We believe that employees play a vital role in the success of a service company. Employees are provided with a variety of benefits such as medical, vision, dental and life insurance, a generous retirement plan, and paid vacations and sick leave. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Executive Officers The following table set forth certain information with respect to the executive officers of the Company.

RISK FACTORS The following are certain risks that management believes are specific to our business. This should not be viewed as an all inclusive list or in any particular order. Our strategy of pursuing acquisitions and de novo branching exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us. We are pursuing a strategy of supplementing organic growth by acquiring other financial institutions or their businesses that we believe will help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy, however, including the following:  We may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks, businesses, assets and liabilities we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially negatively affected;  Prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices we considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future;  The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity into our company to make the transaction economically successful. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful. These risks are present in our recently completed FDIC-assisted transaction involving our assumption of deposits and the acquisition of assets of Cowlitz Bank;  To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.  We have completed two acquisitions during the past year that enhanced our rate of growth. We may not be able to continue to sustain our past rate of growth or to grow at all in the future;  We expect our net income will increase following our acquisitions, however, we also expect our general and administrative expenses and consequently our efficiency rates will also increase. Ultimately, we would expect our efficiency ratio to improve; however, if we are not successful in our integration process, this may not occur, and our acquisitions or branching activities may not be accretive to earnings in the short or long-term; and  The purchase and assumption agreement and the loss sharing agreements we have entered into with the FDIC have specific, detailed and cumbersome compliance, servicing, notification and reporting requirements. Our failure to comply with the terms of the agreements or to properly service the loans and real estate owned under the requirements of the loss share agreement may cause individual loans or large pools of loans to lose eligibility for loss share payments from the FDIC. This could result in material losses that are currently not anticipated. Our business strategy includes significant growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. We intend to pursue a significant growth strategy for our business. We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities. If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we expect to engage in selected acquisitions of financial institutions in the future, including FDIC-assisted transactions, branch acquisitions, or other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful. 27 Table of Contents Our growth initiatives may require us to recruit experienced personnel to assist in such initiatives. Accordingly, the failure to identify and retain such personnel would place significant limitations on our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy. In addition, to the extent we expand our lending beyond our current market areas, we could incur additional risk related to those new market areas. We may not be able to expand our market presence in our existing market areas or successfully enter new markets. If we do not successfully execute our acquisition growth plan, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and growth prospects. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations. While we believe we have the executive management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or that we will successfully manage our growth. See -If the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired, our earnings and capital could be reduced and -Our strategy of pursuing acquisitions and de novo branching exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us for additional risks related to our acquisition strategy. Failure to comply with the terms of the loss share agreement with the FDIC may result in significant losses. In connection with the Cowlitz Bank Acquisition, Heritage Bank entered in to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that significantly reduces the Banks credit loss exposure. The purchase and assumption agreement and the loss sharing agreement for the Cowlitz Bank Acquisition has specific, detailed and cumbersome compliance, servicing, notification and reporting requirements. Our failure to comply with the terms of the agreements or to properly service the loans and REO under the requirements of the loss sharing agreement may cause individual loans or large pools of loans to lose eligibility for loss share payments from the FDIC. This could result in material losses that are currently not anticipated. We may engage in additional FDIC-assisted transactions, which could present additional risks to our business. We may have additional opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. Although these FDIC-assisted transactions typically provide for FDIC assistance to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution, we are (and would be in future transactions) subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction, including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect. In addition, because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and access to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated acquisition, we may face additional risks in FDIC-assisted transactions, including additional strain on management resources, management of problem loans, problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital. We cannot give assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with FDIC-assisted transactions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Financial reform legislation recently enacted by Congress will, among other things, tighten capital standards, create a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). This new law will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing 28 Table of Contents rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. Among the many requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act for new banking regulations is a requirement for new capital regulations to be adopted within 18 months. These regulations must be at least as stringent as, and may call for higher levels of capital than, current regulations. Generally, trust preferred securities will no longer be eligible as Tier 1 capital and outstanding TARP preferred securities will continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital. In addition, the banking regulators are required to seek to make capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies, countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to have a near term impact on us. For example, effective one year after the date of enactment, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact our interest expense. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor and noninterest bearing transaction accounts and IOLTA accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2013. The Dodd-Frank Act will require publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments and authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a companys proxy materials. The legislation also directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. Specifically, the legislation directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Financial institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as banks, will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company. However, compliance with this new law and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of loss. Repayment of our commercial business loans, consisting of commercial and industrial loans as well as owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. We offer different types of commercial loans to a variety of businesses with a focus on real estate related industries and businesses in agricultural, healthcare, legal, and other professions. The types of commercial loans offered are business lines of credit, term equipment financing and term real estate loans. We also originate loans that are guaranteed by the 29 Table of Contents Small Business Administration, or SBA, and are a preferred lender of the SBA. Commercial business lending involves risks that are different from those associated with real estate lending. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Our commercial business loans are primarily made based on our assessment of the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The borrowers cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of commercial business loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. In addition, as part of our commercial business lending activities, we originate agricultural loans. Payments on agricultural loans are typically dependent on the profitable operation or management of the related farm property. The success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields, declines in market prices for agricultural products and the impact of government regulations. In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrowers ability to repay the loan may be impaired. At December 31, 2010, our originated commercial business loans (consisting of commercial and industrial loans and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans) totaled $392.3 million, or approximately 52.8% of our total originated loan portfolio. Our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, which includes multifamily real estate loans, involve higher principal amounts than other loans and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers. We originate commercial and multifamily real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans, and repayment is dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. For example, if the cash flow from the borrowers project is reduced as a result of leases not being obtained or renewed, the borrowers ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Commercial and multifamily real estate loans also expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, many of our commercial and multifamily real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. If we foreclose on a commercial and multifamily real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, commercial and multifamily real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial and multifamily real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. As of December 31, 2010, our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $221.7 million, or 29.9% of our total originated loan portfolio. Our real estate construction and land development loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction lending can involve a higher level of risk than other types of lending because funds are advanced partially based upon the value of the 30 Table of Contents project, which is uncertain prior to the projects completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of a completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, our estimates with regards to the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio may vary from actual results. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness. If our estimate of the value of a project at completion proves to be overstated, it may have inadequate security for repayment of the loan and may incur a loss. As of December 31, 2010, our originated real estate construction and land development loans totaled $58.0 million, or approximately 7.8% of our total originated loan portfolio. Of these loans, $29.4 million, or approximately 4.0%, were one-to-four family residential construction related and $28.6 million, or approximately 3.8% were multifamily residential and commercial construction related. Approximately $15.6 million, or 26.9%, of our total originated construction loans were nonperforming at December 31, 2010. Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in its loan portfolio. Lending money is a substantial part of our business. Every loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:  cash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;  the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of a collateralized loan;  the credit history of a particular borrower;  changes in economic and industry conditions; and  the duration of the loan. We maintain an allowance for loan losses on our non-covered loans, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged against income, which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through a periodic review and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:  our general reserve, based on our historical default and loss experience;  our specific reserve, based on our evaluation of nonperforming loans and their underlying collateral or discounted cash flows; and  current macroeconomic factors. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 31 Table of Contents If our allowance for loan losses is not adequate, we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our capital. For the year ended December 31, 2010 we recorded a provision of $12.0 million compared to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. We also recorded net loan charge-offs of $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Recently, we have been experiencing decreasing loan delinquencies and increasing loan charge-offs. Generally, our nonperforming loans and assets reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers resulting from weakness in the local economy. The deterioration in the general economy has been a significant contributing factor to our current level of delinquencies and nonperforming loans. Slower sales and excess inventory in the housing market has been the primary cause of the increase in foreclosures for one-to-four family residential construction loans, which represented 38.1% of our nonperforming originated loans at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010 our total nonperforming originated loans were $26.9 million, or 3.19% of total originated loans, compared to $35.3 million or 4.27% of total loans at December 31, 2009. Moreover, if weak economic conditions persist, we expect that we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and loan charge-offs. As a result, we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. The current economic condition in the market areas we serve may continue to adversely impact our earnings and could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in the state of Washington and Oregon, and a continuing decline in the economies of our primary market areas of the Pacific Northwest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In particular, the Puget Sound and Portland, Oregon areas have experienced substantial home price declines and increased foreclosures. A series of large Pacific Northwest businesses have implemented substantial employee layoffs and scaled back plans for future growth. Additionally, acquisitions and consolidations have resulted in substantial employee layoffs, along with a significant increase in office space vacancies in downtown Seattle. The Yakima Valley has likewise seen increased unemployment and a continued decline in housing prices. A further deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations:  loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;  we may increase our provision for loan losses;  demand for our products and services may decline;  collateral for loans made may decline further in value, in turn reducing customers borrowing power, reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and  low cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease. We cannot accurately predict the effect of the national economic recession on our future results of operations or the market price of our stock. The national economy and the financial services sector in particular are currently facing challenges of a scope unprecedented in recent history. We cannot accurately predict the severity or duration of the current economic recession, which has adversely impacted the markets we serve. Any further deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in its local markets would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and could also cause the market price of our common stock to decline. While it is impossible to predict how long these recessionary conditions may exist, the economic downturn could continue to present risks for some time for the banking industry and us. 32 Table of Contents Further economic downturns may adversely affect our investment securities portfolio. Further deterioration in the credit markets created market volatility and illiquidity, which may result in further significant declines in the market values of a broad range of investment products. We continue to monitor our investment portfolio for deteriorating collateral values and other-than-temporary impairments. Additionally, other than temporary impairments could adversely affect our operating results. If the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired, our earnings and capital could be reduced. Accounting standards require that we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. Under purchase accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of its net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirers balance sheet as goodwill. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Such evaluation is based on a variety of factors, including the quoted price of our common stock, market prices of common stock of other banking organizations, common stock trading multiples, discounted cash flows, and data from comparable acquisitions. At December 31, 2010, we had goodwill with a carrying amount of $13.0 million. Declines in our stock price or a prolonged weakness in the operating environment of the financial services industry may result in a future impairment charge. Any such impairment charge could have a material adverse affect on our operating results and capital. Fluctuating interest rates can adversely affect our profitability. Our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference (or spread) between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread, and, in turn, our profitability. FDIC insurance premiums increased significantly in 2009 and we may pay higher FDIC premiums in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum reserve ratio. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC has not announced how it will implement this offset. In addition to the statutory minimum ratio, the FDIC must set a designated reserve ratio or DRR, which may exceed the statutory minimum. The FDIC has set 2.0 as the DRR. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted final regulations under which insurance premium are based on an institutions total assets minus its tangible equity instead of its deposits. It is possible that our insurance premiums will increase under these final regulations. Decreased volumes and lower gains on sales and brokering of mortgage loans sold could adversely impact net income. We originate and sell mortgage loans as well as broker mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates affect demand for our loan products and the revenue realized on the sale of loans. A decrease in the volume of loans sold/brokered can decrease our revenues and net income. 33 Table of Contents The tightening of available liquidity could limit our ability to replace deposits and fund loan demand, which could adversely affect our earnings and capital levels. A tightening of the credit markets and the inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits and fund continued loan growth may negatively affect asset growth and, consequently, our earnings capability and capital levels. In addition to any deposit growth, maturity of investment securities and loan payments, we rely from time to time on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle, or FHLB, and certain other wholesale funding sources to fund loans and replace deposits. In the event of a further downturn in the economy, these additional funding sources could be negatively affected which could limit the funds available to us. Our liquidity position could be significantly constrained if we were unable to access funds from the FHLB or other wholesale funding sources. Our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high. We are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. At some point we may need to raise additional capital to support continued internal growth and growth through acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances of our ability to raise additional capital if needed, or if the terms will be acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Continued deterioration in the financial position of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle may result in future impairment losses of our investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock. At December 31, 2010, we owned $5.6 million of stock of the FHLB of Seattle. As a condition of membership at the FHLB, we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB and is calculated in accordance with the Capital Plan of the FHLB. Our FHLB stock has a par value of $100, is carried at cost, and is subject to impairment testing. The FHLB has announced that it had a risk-based capital deficiency under the regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or the FHFA, its primary regulator, and that it would suspend future dividends and the repurchase and redemption of outstanding common stock. As a result, the FHLB has not paid a dividend since the fourth quarter of 2008. The FHLB has communicated that it believes the calculation of risk-based capital under the current rules of the FHFA significantly overstates the market risk of the FHLBs private-label mortgage-backed securities in the current market environment and that it has enough capital to cover the risks reflected in its balance sheet. As a result, we have not recorded an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in FHLB stock. However, continued deterioration in the FHLBs financial position may result in impairment in the value of those securities. In addition, on October 25, 2010, the FHLB received a consent order from the FHFA. The potential impact of the consent order is unknown at this time. We will continue to monitor the financial condition of the FHLB as it relates to, among other things, the recoverability of our investment. There may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur. 34 Table of Contents Our board of directors is authorized generally to cause us to issue additional common stock, as well as series of preferred stock, without any action on the part of our shareholders except as may be required under the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition, the board has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected. New or changing tax, accounting, and regulatory rules and interpretations could significantly impact strategic initiatives, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a companys stockholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading Item 1. BusinessSupervision and Regulation. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, restrict mergers and acquisitions, investments, access to capital, the location of banking offices, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Further, recent regulatory changes to the rules for overdraft fees for debit transactions and interchange fees could reduce our fee income which would result in a reduction of our noninterest income. Our failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability. The banking and financial services industry is very competitive. Legal and regulatory developments have made it easier for new and sometimes unregulated competitors to compete with us. Consolidation among financial service providers has resulted in fewer very large national and regional banking and financial institutions holding a large accumulation of assets. These institutions generally have significantly greater resources, a wider geographic presence or greater accessibility. Our competitors sometimes are also able to offer more services, more favorable pricing or greater customer convenience than we do. In addition, our competition has grown from new banks and other financial services providers that target our existing or potential customers. As consolidation continues, we expect additional institutions to try to exploit our market. Technological developments have allowed competitors including some non-depository institutions, to compete more effectively in local markets and have expanded the range of financial products, services and capital available to our target customers. If we are unable to implement, maintain and use such technologies effectively, we may not be able to offer products or achieve cost-efficiencies necessary to compete in our industry. In addition, some of these competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures. We rely heavily on the proper functioning of our technology. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer 35 Table of Contents relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology. If any of our third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to locate alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality, as found in our existing systems, without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business. Changes in accounting standards may affect how we record and report our performance. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we report and record our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in a retrospective adjustment to prior financial statements. The Warrant we issued to the Treasury may be dilutive to holders of our common stock. The ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the Warrant we issued to the Treasury in conjunction with the sale to the Treasury of the Series A Preferred Stock is exercised. The 138,037 shares of common stock underlying the Warrant represent approximately 0.9% of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2010 (including the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant in total shares outstanding). Although the Treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the Warrant, a transferee of any portion of the Warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the Warrant is not bound by this restriction. We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects. Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the community banking industry where we conduct our business. The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel. In particular, our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Brian Vance, and certain other employees. In this regard we are currently working with a nationally recognized community bank compensation consultant to prepare severance agreements to replace the severance agreements we previously had in place with certain of our key employees.
