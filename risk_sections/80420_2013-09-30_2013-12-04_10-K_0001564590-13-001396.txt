Business Overview Powell Industries, Inc. (we, us, our, Powell or the Company) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2004 as a successor to a Nevada company incorporated in 1968. The Nevada corporation was the successor to a company founded by William E. Powell in 1947, which merged into the Company in 1977. Our major subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned, include: Powell Electrical Systems, Inc.; Transdyn, Inc.; Powell Industries International, B.V.; Switchgear & Instrumentation Limited (S&I) and Powell Canada Inc. We develop, design, manufacture and service custom engineered-to-order equipment and systems for the management and control of electrical energy and other critical processes. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we serve the energy, industrial, utility, transportation and environmental industries. Our website is powellind.com. We make available, free of charge on or through our website, copies of our Annual Reports, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Paper or electronic copies of such material may also be requested by contacting the Company at our corporate offices. References to Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to our fiscal years ended September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our business operations are consolidated into two business segments: Electrical Power Products and Process Control Systems. Our Electrical Power Products segment accounted for approximately 94%, 96% and 95% of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively. Revenues from customers located in the United States of America (U.S.) accounted for approximately 60%, 58% and 67% of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Revenues from customers located in Canada accounted for approximately 17%, 13% and 16% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Approximately 67% of our long-lived assets were located in the U.S. at September 30, 2013, with the remaining long-lived assets located primarily in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Canada. Financial information related to our business and geographical segments is included in Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Electrical Power Products Our Electrical Power Products business segment develops, designs, manufactures and markets custom engineered-to-order electrical power distribution and control systems designed (1) to distribute, monitor and control the flow of electrical energy and (2) to provide protection to motors, transformers and other electrically-powered equipment. Our principal products include integrated power control room substations, traditional and arc-resistant medium-voltage distribution switchgear, medium-voltage circuit breakers, offshore generator and control modules, monitoring and control communications systems, motor control centers and bus duct systems. These products are designed for application voltages ranging from 480 volts to 38,000 volts and are used in electric rail transportation, refining, chemical manufacturing, oil and gas production, electric utility systems and other heavy industrial markets. Our product scope includes designs tested to meet both U.S. standards (ANSI) and international standards (IEC). We also seek to assist customers by providing value-added services such as spare parts, field service inspection, installation, commissioning and repair, retrofit and retrofill components for existing systems and replacement circuit breakers for switchgear that is obsolete or that is no longer produced by the original manufacturer. We work to establish long-term relationships with the end users of our systems as well as the design and construction engineering firms contracted by those end users. Customers and Markets This business segments principal products are designed for use by, and marketed to, technologically sophisticated users of large amounts of electrical energy that typically have a need for complex combinations of electrical components and systems. Our customers and their industries include oil and gas producers, oil and gas pipelines, refineries, petrochemical plants, electrical power generators, public and private utilities, co-generation facilities, mining/metals operations, pulp and paper plants, transportation authorities, governmental agencies and other large industrial customers. 4 Products and services are principally sold directly to the end user or to an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm on behalf of the end user. Each project is specifically tailored to meet the exact specifications and requirements of the individual customer. Powells expertise is in the engineering, project management and integration of the various systems into a single deliverable. We market and sell our products and services, which are typically awarded in competitive bid situations, to a wide variety of customers, governmental agencies, markets and geographic regions. Contracts often represent complex projects with an individual customer. By their nature, these projects are typically nonrecurring. Thus, multiple and/or continuous projects of similar magnitude with the same customer may vary. As such, the timing of large project awards may cause material fluctuations in segment revenues. We could be adversely impacted by a significant reduction in business volume from a particular industry that we currently serve, however we do not believe that the loss of any specific customer would have a material adverse effect on our business. No customer accounted for more than 10% of this segments revenues in Fiscal 2013. However, in both Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 one customer accounted for 10% of this segments revenues. For information on the geographic areas in which our consolidated revenues were recorded in each of the past three fiscal years, see Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Competition We strive to be the supplier of choice for custom engineered-to-order system solutions and services to a variety of customers and markets. Our activities are predominantly in the oil and gas and the electric utility industries, but also include other markets where customers need to manage, monitor and control large amounts of electrical energy. The majority of our business is in support of capital investment projects that are highly complex and competitively bid. We compete with a small number of multinational competitors that sell to a broad industrial and geographic market and with smaller, regional competitors that typically have limited capabilities and scope of supply. Our principal competitors include ABB, Eaton, GE, Schneider and Siemens. The competitive factors used during bid evaluation by our customers vary from project to project and may include technical support and application expertise, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, equipment rating, delivered value, scheduling and price. While projects are typically non-recurring, a significant portion of our business is from repeat customers and many times involves third-party EPC firms hired by the end user and with which we also have long and established relationships. We consider our engineering, manufacturing and service capabilities vital to the success of our business, and believe our technical and project management strengths, together with our responsiveness and flexibility to the needs of our customers, give us a competitive advantage in our markets. Ultimately, our competitive position is dependent upon our ability to provide quality custom engineered-to-order products, services and systems on a timely basis at a competitive price. Backlog Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Orders in the Electrical Power Products business segment backlog at September 30, 2013 totaled $435.0 million compared to $361.9 million at September 30, 2012. We anticipate that approximately $370 million of this segments Fiscal 2013 ending backlog will be fulfilled during our fiscal year ending September 30, 2014. Conditions outside of our control have caused us to experience some customer delays and cancellations of certain projects in the past; accordingly, backlog may not be indicative of future operating results as orders in our backlog may be cancelled or modified by our customers. Raw Materials and Suppliers The principal raw materials used in the operation of our Electrical Power Products business segment include steel, copper, aluminum and various electrical components. Raw material costs represented 46% of this segments revenues in Fiscal 2013. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements, disruptions in supplies or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. We purchase certain key electrical components on a sole-sourced basis and maintain a qualification and performance monitoring program to control risk associated with sole-sourced items. Changes in our design to accommodate similar components from other suppliers could be implemented to resolve a supply problem related to a sole-sourced component. In this circumstance, supply problems could result in delays in our ability to meet commitments to our customers. We believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally sufficient, and we have no reason to believe a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during our fiscal year ending September 30, 2014. While we are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials, we are highly dependent on our suppliers in order to meet commitments to our customers. We have not experienced significant or unusual issues in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in the past three fiscal years. 5 This business segment is subject to the effects of changing material prices. During the last three fiscal years, we experienced price volatility for certain commodities, in particular steel, copper and aluminum products, which are used in the production of our products. While the cost outlook for commodities used in the production of our products is not certain, we believe we can manage this volatility through contract pricing adjustments, with material-cost predictive estimating and by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts. We did not enter into any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price changes in Fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011. Employees At September 30, 2013, the Electrical Power Products business segment had 2,923 full-time employees located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Our employees are not represented by unions, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good. Research and Development This business segments research and development activities are directed toward the development of new products and processes as well as improvements in existing products and processes. Research and development expenditures were $7.6 million, $6.3 million and $6.4 million in Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intellectual Property While we are the holder of various patents, trademarks, copyrights and licenses relating to this business segment, we do not consider any individual intellectual property to be material to our consolidated business operations. Process Control Systems Our Process Control Systems business segment designs and delivers custom engineered-to-order technology solutions that help our customers manage their critical transportation, environmental and energy management processes and facilities. Our proprietary DYNAC® software suite provides a highly integrated operations management solution for these vital operations. The mission-critical information may be traffic flow in our intelligent transportation management solutions, water quality in our environmental treatment solutions or electrical power management in the case of our substation automation solutions. DYNAC® has user-configurable applications designed specifically for clients that require high performance, 24/7 availability and superior data integrity in a secure environment. We provide a comprehensive set of technical services to deliver these systems. A diverse team of professional systems engineers, software engineers, analysts, network specialists and automation engineers provides expertise for the entire life cycle of a technology project. We have designed and built systems for various transit facilities and roadways around the world. Customers and Markets This business segments products and services are principally sold directly to end users in the transportation, environmental and energy sectors. From time to time, a significant percentage of revenues may result from one specific contract or customer due to the nature of large projects common to this business segment. In Fiscal 2013, one customer accounted for 16% of this segments revenues. In Fiscal 2012 and 2011, no customer individually accounted for more than 10% of this segments revenues. We do not believe that the loss of any specific customer would have a material adverse effect on our business. Contracts often represent large-scale, single-need projects with an individual customer. By their nature, these projects are typically nonrecurring for a given customer. Thus, multiple and/or continuous projects of similar magnitude with the same customer are rare. As such, the timing of large project awards may cause material fluctuations in segment revenues. During each of the past three fiscal years, the U.S. is the only country that accounted for more than 10% of segment revenues. For information on the geographic areas in which our consolidated revenues were recorded in each of the past three fiscal years, see Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 6 Competition This business segment operates in a competitive market where competition for each contract varies. Depending upon the type of system and customer requirements, the competition may include large multinational firms as well as smaller regional competitors. Our customized systems are designed to meet the specifications of our customers. Each system is designed, delivered and installed to the specific requirements of the particular application. We consider our engineering, systems integration and technical support capabilities vital to the success of our business. We believe our turnkey systems integration capabilities, customizable software, domain expertise, specialty contracting experience and financial strength give us a competitive advantage in our markets. Backlog Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Orders in the Process Control Systems business segment backlog at September 30, 2013, totaled $81.6 million compared to $74.8 million at September 30, 2012. We anticipate that approximately $20 million of this segments ending Fiscal 2013 backlog will be fulfilled during our September 30, 2014 fiscal year. Conditions outside of our control have caused us to experience some customer delays and cancellations of certain projects in the past; accordingly, backlog may not be indicative of future operating results as orders in our backlog may be cancelled or modified by our customers. Employees The Process Control Systems business segment had 199 full-time employees at September 30, 2013, primarily located in the United States. Our employees are not represented by unions, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good. Research and Development The majority of research and development activities of this business segment are directed toward the development of our software suites for the management and control of the critical processes and facilities of our customers. Non-project research and development expenditures were $0.9 million, $1.4 million and $1.1 million in Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intellectual Property While we are the holder of various trademarks, licenses and copyrights related to software for this business segment, we do not consider any individual intellectual property to be material to our consolidated business operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the most significant risks and uncertainties described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed and we may not be able to achieve our goals. This Annual Report also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the discussion under Forward-Looking Statements, above. Economic uncertainty and financial market conditions may impact our customer base, suppliers and backlog. Various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price and demand for oil and gas, capital expenditures, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty regarding these factors could impact our customers and severely impact the demand for projects that would result in orders for our products and services. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences difficulties that result in a reduction or interruption in supply to us, or they fail to meet our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted until we are able to secure alternative sources. Furthermore, our ability to expand our business would be limited in the future if we are unable to increase our bonding capacity or our credit facility on favorable terms or at all. These disruptions could lead to reduced demand for our products and services; could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations; and could potentially impact the trading price of our common stock. 7 Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and, therefore, may not be a reliable indicator of our future earnings. We have a backlog of uncompleted contracts. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business taken, which represents the revenue value of new project commitments received. Backlog consists of projects that either (1) have not yet been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet completed. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, projects are cancelled that appeared to have a high certainty of going forward at the time they were recorded as new business taken. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to our being unable to recover certain direct costs, cancelled projects may also result in additional unrecoverable costs due to underutilization of our assets. The use of percentage-of-completion accounting on our fixed-price contracts could result in volatility in our results of operations. As discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, the majority of our revenues are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. The process of estimating costs on projects requires a significant amount of judgment and combines professional engineering, cost estimating, pricing and accounting inputs. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and estimates of revenue and cost to complete are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of estimated contract performance. Previously recorded estimates are adjusted as the project progresses. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year. A portion of our contracts contain terms with penalty provisions. Some of our contracts contain penalty provisions for the failure to meet specified contractual provisions. These contractual provisions define the conditions under which our customers may make claims against us. Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials used to manufacture our products may reduce our profits and could materially impact our ability to meet commitments to our customers. Our raw material costs represented 45% of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2013. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products, including steel, aluminum, copper and various electrical components. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements, changes in supplier availability or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. Our ability to meet customer commitments could be negatively impacted due to the time and effort associated with the selection and qualification of a new supplier. Our industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than we do. Competition in the industry depends on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products or services at lower prices than we are able to provide. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industry, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base. Our operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of government regulations. Changes in laws or regulations regarding oil and gas exploration and development activities and decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations. Various regulations have been implemented in the U.S. related to safety and certification requirements applicable to oil and gas drilling and production activities and we cannot predict whether operators will be able to satisfy these requirements. Further, we cannot predict future regulations in any country in which we operate and how those regulations may affect our ability to perform projects in those regions. 8 Our international operations expose us to risks that are different from, or possibly greater than, the risks we are exposed to domestically and may adversely affect our operations. Revenues from customers located outside of the U.S. accounted for 40% of our consolidated revenues in Fiscal 2013, including sales from our operations in the United Kingdom and Canada. While our manufacturing facilities are in developed countries with historically stable operating and fiscal environments, our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by the following: political and economic instability; social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict; inflation; currency fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions; governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds; and trade restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the U.S. or other countries. Additionally, the compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions outside the United States, could adversely impact our ability to compete for contracts in such jurisdictions. Moreover, the violation of such laws or regulations could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of export privileges. Acquisitions involve a number of risks. Our strategy has been to pursue growth and product diversification through the acquisition of companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings. We routinely review potential acquisitions, however we may be unable to implement this strategy. Acquisitions involve certain risks, including difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; failure to realize cost savings; the termination of relationships by key personnel and customers of the acquired company and a failure to add additional employees to handle the increased volume of business. Additionally, financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as valuation, tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting from our acquisitions pose risks to our strategy. Due diligence may not reveal all risks and challenges associated with our acquisitions. It is possible impairment charges resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition may negatively impact our earnings. Financing for acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which, if available, may not be available on attractive terms. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by changes in estimated costs or revenues under fixed-price contracts; the timing and volume of work under new agreements; general economic conditions; the spending patterns of customers; variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter; losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance; a change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions; a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business; increases in design and manufacturing costs; the ability of customers to pay their invoices owed to us; and disagreements with customers related to project performance on delivery. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for an entire year. The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business. We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers, senior management and other key professionals. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business. Our business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel such as engineers, project managers and select skilled tradesmen. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues, and may adversely impact our profitability. Actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition. We could be named as a defendant in future legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services or manufacturing equipment. We are, and will likely continue to be, a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers in which we seek to recover payment of contractual amounts due to us, as well as claims for increased costs incurred by us. When appropriate, we establish provisions against certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each exposure. 9 If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or wrong, our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business. Unforeseen difficulties with our enterprise resource planning, engineering and manufacturing process systems (Business Systems) could adversely affect our internal controls and our business. The efficient execution of our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our Business Systems that support our production, engineering, human resources, estimating, financial, job management and customer systems. Any significant failure or malfunction of our Business Systems may result in disruption of our operations. These systems may be susceptible to outages due to natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to security breaches such as computer viruses and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our Business Systems and adversely affect our business or results of operations. Additionally, we are in the process of re-implementing our Business Systems and adding additional software that will redesign and improve our processes. There can be no certainty that this system will deliver the expected benefits. The failure to achieve our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2) deliver on our commitment to our customers which could negatively impact our operations. We carry insurance against many potential liabilities, but our management of risk may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks. Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to our related exposures, including certain casualty, property, business interruption, self-insured medical and dental programs, these policies contain deductibles, self-insured retentions and limits of coverage. We estimate our liabilities for known claims and unpaid claims and expenses based on information available as well as projections for claims incurred but not reported. However, insurance liabilities, some of which are self-insured, are difficult to estimate due to various factors. If any of our insurance policies or programs is not effective in mitigating our risks, we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance policies or that exceed our accruals or our coverage limits and could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Technological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete. All of the products manufactured and sold by Powell depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace. The competitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business. It is possible for competitors (both domestic and international) to develop products or production methods that will make current products or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence; therefore, we cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide products and services that are superior in both price and quality. Catastrophic events could disrupt our business. The occurrence of catastrophic events, ranging from natural disasters such as hurricanes, to epidemics such as health epidemics, to acts of war and terrorism, could disrupt or delay our ability to complete projects for our customers and could potentially expose us to third-party liability claims. Such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance policies or may be subject to deductibles or exceed coverage limits. In addition, such events could impact our customers and suppliers, resulting in temporary or long-term delays and/or cancellations of orders for raw materials used in normal business operations. These situations are outside our control and could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Unforeseen difficulties with the ramp-up of our two new facilities could adversely affect our operations. We recently completed the construction of a manufacturing/assembly facility in the United States, as well as one in Canada. We have relocated from two of our existing facilities, which were leased. Any significant delay in the ramp-up, staffing and expansion of our operations in either of these new facilities could adversely affect our operations and may adversely impact our profitability.
