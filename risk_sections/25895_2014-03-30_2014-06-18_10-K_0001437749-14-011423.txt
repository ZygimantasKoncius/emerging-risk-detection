ITEM 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and other filings made by the Company with the SEC should be considered in evaluating the Company’s business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, operating results may be affected in future periods. The loss of one or more of the Company’s key customers could result in a material loss of revenues. The Company’s top two customers represented approximately 60% of gross sales in fiscal year 2014. Although the Company does not enter into contracts with its key customers, it expects them to continue to be a significant portion of its gross sales in the future. The loss of one or more of these customers could result in a material decrease in the Company’s revenue and operating income. The Company’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which the Company operates. Economic conditions, including the availability of credit and the possibility of a global recession, could adversely impact the Company’s business. These conditions could result in reduced demand for some of the Company’s products, increased order cancellations and returns, an increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories and increased pressure on the prices of the Company’s products. Also, although the Company’s use of a commercial factor significantly reduces the risk associated with collecting accounts receivable, the factor may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer, and the likelihood of the factor doing so may increase due to a change in economic conditions. Such an action by the factor could result in the loss of future sales to the affected customer. The loss of one or more of the Company’s licenses could result in a material loss of revenues. Sales of licensed products represented 61% of the Company’s gross sales in fiscal year 2014, which included 38% of sales associated with the Company’s license agreements with Disney. The Company could experience a material loss of revenues if it is unable to renew its major license agreements or obtain new licenses. The Company’s inability to anticipate and respond to consumers’ tastes and preferences could adversely affect the Company’s revenues. Sales are driven by consumer demand for the Company’s products. There can be no assurance that the demand for the Company’s products will not decline or that the Company will be able to anticipate and respond to changes in demand. The Company’s failure to adapt to these changes could lead to lower sales and excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company’s ability to comply with its credit facility is subject to future performance and other factors. The Company’s ability to make required payments of principal and interest on its debts, to refinance its maturing indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures or to comply with its debt covenants will depend upon future performance. The Company’s future performance is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Company’s credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Company’s lender could make an immediate demand of the amount outstanding under the credit facility. If a default was to occur and such a demand was to be made, there can be no assurance that the Company’s assets would be sufficient to repay the indebtedness in full. 6 Customer pricing pressures could result in lower selling prices, which could negatively affect the Company’s operating results. The Company’s customers could place pressure on the Company to reduce the prices of its products. The Company continuously strives to stay ahead of its competition in sourcing, which allows the Company to obtain lower cost products while maintaining high standards for quality. There can be no assurance that the Company could respond to a decrease in sales prices by proportionately reducing its costs, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The strength of the Company’s competitors may impact the Company’s ability to maintain and grow its sales, which could decrease the Company’s revenues. The infant and toddler consumer products industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with a variety of distributors and manufacturers, both branded and private label. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends principally on styling, price, service to the retailer and continued high regard for the Company’s products and trade names. Several of these competitors are larger than the Company and have greater financial resources than the Company, and some have experienced financial challenges from time to time, including servicing significant levels of debt. Those facing financial pressures could choose to make particularly aggressive pricing decisions in an attempt to increase revenue. The effects of increased competition could result in a material decrease in the Company’s revenues. Changes in international trade regulations and other risks associated with foreign trade could adversely affect the Company’s sourcing. The Company sources its products primarily from foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration being in China. The adoption of regulations related to the importation of product, including quotas, duties, taxes and other charges or restrictions on imported goods, and changes in U.S. customs procedures could result in an increase in the cost of the Company’s products. Delays in customs clearance of goods or the disruption of international transportation lines used by the Company could result in the Company being unable to deliver goods to customers in a timely manner or the potential loss of sales altogether. The Company’s sourcing and marketing operations in foreign countries are subject to anti-corruption laws. The Company’s foreign operations are subject to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, which apply to the Company’s directors, officers, employees and agents acting on behalf of the Company. Failure to comply with these laws could result in damage to the Company’s reputation, a diversion of management’s attention from its business, increased legal and investigative costs, and civil and criminal penalties, any or all of which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company’s debt covenants may affect its liquidity or limit its ability to pursue acquisitions, incur debt, make investments, sell assets or complete other significant transactions. The Company’s credit facility contains usual and customary covenants regarding significant transactions, including restrictions on other indebtedness, liens, transfers of assets, investments and acquisitions, merger or consolidation transactions, transactions with affiliates and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the Company and its subsidiaries. Unless waived by the Company’s lender, these covenants could limit the Company’s ability to pursue opportunities to expand its business operations, respond to changes in business and economic conditions and obtain additional financing, or otherwise engage in transactions that the Company considers beneficial. The Company’s success is dependent upon retaining key management personnel. The Company’s ability to retain qualified executive management and other key personnel is vital to the Company’s success. If the Company were unable to retain or attract qualified individuals, the Company’s growth and operating results could be materially impacted. The Company may need to write down or write off inventory. If product programs end before the inventory is completely sold, then the remaining inventory may have to be sold at less than carrying value. The market value of certain inventory items could drop to below carrying value after a decline in sales, at the end of programs, or when management makes the decision to exit a product group. Such inventory would then need to be written down to the lower of carrying or market value, or possibly completely written off, which would adversely affect the Company’s operating results. 7 Economic conditions could result in an increase in the amounts paid for the Company’s products. Significant increases in the price of raw materials that are components of the Company’s products, including cotton, oil and labor, could adversely affect the amounts that the Company must pay its suppliers for its finished goods. If the Company is unable to pass these cost increases along to its customers, its profitability could be adversely affected. Recalls or product liability claims could increase costs or reduce sales. The Company must comply with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which imposes strict standards to protect children from potentially harmful products and which requires that the Company’s products be tested to ensure that they are within acceptable levels for lead and phthalates. The Company must also comply with related regulations developed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory authorities. The Company’s products could be subject to involuntary recalls and other actions by these authorities, and concerns about product safety may lead the Company to voluntarily recall, accept returns or discontinue the sale of select products. Product liability claims could exceed or fall outside the scope of the Company’s insurance coverage. Recalls or product liability claims could result in decreased consumer demand for the Company’s products, damage to the Company’s reputation, a diversion of management’s attention from its business, and increased customer service and support costs, any or all of which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company could experience losses associated with its intellectual property. The Company relies upon the fair interpretation and enforcement of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., similar laws in other countries, and agreements with employees, customers, suppliers, licensors and other parties. Such reliance serves to establish and maintain the intellectual property rights associated with the products that the Company develops and sells. However, the laws and courts of certain countries at times do not protect intellectual property rights or respect contractual agreements to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions the Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights against counterfeiting or enforce its contractual agreements with other parties. Other entities could also claim that the Company is infringing upon their intellectual property rights, and some of these claims could lead to a civil complaint. A recent trend is for an entity to purchase an intellectual property asset similar to a given company’s, but with no intention of developing and selling an associated product. Instead, the buyer’s only intention is to assert a claim of infringement in an attempt to extract a settlement from the company allegedly infringing. To that end, the Company and CCIP have been in protracted litigation with BreathableBaby, LLC (“BreathableBaby”), which has alleged that CCIP’s mesh crib liner infringes BreathableBaby’s patent rights relating to its air permeable infant bedding technology. The occurrence of any or all of the foregoing events or an unfavorable outcome in the BreathableBaby litigation could result in any or all of the following: (i) civil judgments against the Company, which could require the payment of royalties on both past and future sales of certain products, as well as plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs; (ii) impairment charges of up to the carrying value of the Company’s intellectual property rights; (iii) restrictions on the ability of the Company to sell certain of its products; (iv) legal and other costs associated with investigations and litigation; and (v) a degradation of the Company’s competitive position. Currency exchange rate fluctuations and other supplier-related risks could increase the Company’s expenses. The Company’s products are manufactured by foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration being in China. Difficulties encountered by these suppliers, such as fire, accident, natural disasters, outbreaks of contagious diseases or economic and political instability, could halt or disrupt production of the Company’s products. Also, restrictive actions by foreign governments, a strengthening of the Chinese currency versus the U.S. dollar or changes in import duties or import or export restrictions could increase the prices at which the Company purchases finished goods. If the Company is unable to pass these cost increases along to its customers, its profitability could be adversely affected. A stockholder could lose all or a portion of his or her investment in the Company. The Company’s common stock has historically experienced a degree of price variability, and the price could be subject to rapid and substantial fluctuations. The Company’s common stock has also historically been thinly traded, a circumstance that exists when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders for the Company’s common stock at any given point in time. In such situations, a stockholder may be unable to liquidate his or her position in the Company’s common stock at the desired price. Also, as an equity investment, a stockholder’s investment in the Company is subordinate to the interests of the Company’s creditors, and a stockholder could lose all or a substantial portion of his or her investment in the Company in the event of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filing or liquidation. 8
