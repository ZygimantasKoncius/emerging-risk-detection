ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements that we make in this Report and elsewhere (including oral statements) from time to time. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Report. If we fail to raise additional capital or receive substantial cash inflows from our partners by September of 2007, we will be forced to cease operations. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $21.5 million in cash and investments, approximately $13.4 million in working capital, a stockholders deficit of approximately $6.1 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $392 million. Our operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 (after receipt of $7.3 million of collaboration and feasibility payments which does not recur with regularity or at all) was approximately $27 million. We believe operating loss is a more representative measure to discuss, as net loss of $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes $13.6 million of non-cash other expense items related to a beneficial conversion feature and derivatives. We anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future, and that our business will require substantial additional investment that we have not yet secured. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included an explanatory paragraph expressing the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to continue operations through approximately September of 2007, or earlier if unforeseen events or circumstances arise that negatively affect our liquidity. If we fail to raise additional capital or obtain substantial cash inflows from existing partners prior to September 2007, we will be forced to cease operations. We are in discussions with investment bankers and others concerning our financing options. While our plan is to raise capital when needed and/or to pursue product partnering opportunities, we cannot be sure how much we will need to spend in order to develop, market and manufacture new products and technologies in the future. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on research and development, including amounts spent on conducting clinical trials for our product candidates. Further, we will not have sufficient resources to develop fully any new products or technologies unless we are able to raise substantial additional financing on acceptable terms or to secure funds from our new or existing partners. We cannot assure you that financing will be available when needed, or on favorable terms or at all. If additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities would result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Our failure to raise capital when needed would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could force us to reduce or discontinue operations. We may not be able to meet the covenants detailed in the Convertible Notes with MHR Institutional Partners IIA LP , which could result in an increase in the interest rate on the Convertible Notes and/or accelerated maturity of the Convertible Notes, which we would not be able to satisfy. On September 26, 2005, we executed a Senior Secured Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with MHR Institutional Partners IIA LP (together with its affiliates, MHR). The Loan Agreement, as amended, provides for a seven year, $15 million secured loan from MHR to us at an interest rate of 11% (the Loan). Under the Loan Agreement, MHR requested, and on May 16, 2006 we effected, the exchange of the Loan for 11% senior secured convertible notes (the Convertible Notes) with substantially the same terms as the Loan agreement, except that the Convertible Notes are convertible, at the sole discretion of MHR or any assignee thereof, into shares of our common stock at a price per share of $3.78. Interest will be payable in the form of additional Convertible Notes rather than in cash and we have the right to call the Convertible Notes after September 26, 2010 if certain conditions are satisfied. The Convertible Notes are secured by a first priority lien in favor of MHR on substantially all of our assets. 18 The Convertible Notes provide for certain events of default including failure to perfect liens in favor of MHR created by the transaction, failure to observe any covenant or agreement, failure to maintain the listing and trading of our common stock, sale of a substantial portion of our assets, or merger with another entity without the prior consent of MHR, or any governmental action renders us unable to honor or perform our obligations under the Convertible Notes or results in a material adverse effect on our operations among other things. If an event of default occurs, the Convertible Notes provide for the immediate repayment of the Notes and certain additional amounts described above and as set forth in the Convertible Notes. At such time, we may not be able to make the required payment, and if we are unable to pay the amount due under the Notes, the resulting default would enable MHR to foreclose on all of our assets. Any of the foregoing events would have a material adverse effect on our business and on the value of our stockholders investments in our common stock. We currently have a waiver from MHR for failure to perfect liens on certain intellectual property rights, through March 17, 2008. We may not be able to make the payments we owe to Novartis. On December 1, 2004 we issued a $10 million convertible note (the Novartis Note) to Novartis in connection with a research collaboration option relating to the development of PTH 1-34. The Novartis Note, as amended, bears interest at a rate of 3% prior to December 1, 2006, 5% from December 1, 2006 through December 1, 2008, and 7% from that point until maturity on December 1, 2009. We have the option to pay interest in cash on a current basis or accrue the periodic interest as an addition to the principal amount of the Novartis Note. In the event that interest accrues on the Novartis Note, the accretion to principal will cause future interest payments to rise. We may convert the Novartis Note at any time prior to maturity into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal and accrued and unpaid interest to be converted divided by the then market price of our common stock, provided certain conditions are met, including that the number of shares issued to Novartis, when issued, does not exceed 19.9% of the total shares of Company common stock outstanding, that at the time of such conversion no event of default under the Note has occurred and is continuing, and that there is either an effective shelf registration statement in effect covering the resale of the shares issued in connection with such conversion or the shares may be resold by Novartis pursuant to SEC Rule 144(k). These conditions may not be met and we may be unable to convert the Novartis Note, in which case we would be required to continue to make interest payments (and the rates of such interest payments will increase over time) and repay the notes when due in 2009. Under the Novartis Note, an event of default would include failure to timely cure a default in the payment of any other indebtedness in excess of a certain material threshold, or there occurs an acceleration of indebtedness in excess of that threshold, becoming entitled to terminate the registration of our securities or the filing of reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ, a change of control (including by, among other things, a change in the composition of a majority of our board other than as approved by the board) in any one-year period, a merger which results in our stockholders holding shares that represent less than a majority of the voting power of the merged entity, and any other acquisition by a third party of shares that represent a majority of the voting power of the company), sale of substantially all of our assets, or our inability to honor or perform our obligations under the new research collaboration option relating to the development of PTH 1-34, among other things. Upon the occurrence of any such event of default prior to conversion, any unpaid principal and accrued interest on the Novartis Note would become immediately due and payable. At such time, we may not be able to make the required payment, and if we are unable to pay the amount due under the Novartis Note, the resulting default would have a material adverse effect on our business and on the value of our stockholders investments in our common stock. Further, if the Novartis Note has been converted into our common stock, Novartis would have the right to require us to repurchase the shares of common stock within six months after an event of default under the Novartis Note, for an aggregate purchase price equal to the principal and interest that was converted, plus interest from the date of conversion, as if no conversion had occurred. If we are unable to make the repurchase, the resulting default would have a material adverse effect on our business and on the value of our stockholders investments in our common stock. We are highly dependent on the clinical success of our oral heparin and insulin product candidates. Oral heparin and oral insulin are our two lead programs and are among our most advanced programs. To date, we have invested $95 million and $20 million, in oral heparin and oral insulin, respectively. We believe that, based on market size, these two products, if approved, could represent our largest sources of revenue. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for either of these products, either solely through our own efforts or through collaborations with one or more major pharmaceutical companies, our ability to fund future operations from operating revenue or issuance of additional equity is likely to be adversely affected. We are not dependent on successful culmination of clinical trials or regulatory approval of any particular one of our other product candidate programs because our investment in each such program and reward upon successful completion of each such program is substantially less significant to our long-term viability. 19 Oral Heparin Heparin delivery is a highly competitive area. Other companies currently are developing spray (buccal) or alternate forms of heparin and other anti-thrombotics. We are developing solid dosage forms of oral heparin and have commenced Phase III testing for the SNAC/heparin molecule combination. We previously developed a liquid form of oral heparin and in 2000 conducted a Phase III clinical trial that was completed in early 2002. The trial did not meet its endpoint of superiority to LOVENOX®, a leading low molecular weight heparin. We believe that the trial failed to meet its endpoint of superiority possibly due in part to the poor taste of the liquid formulation. We subsequently restructured our operations, which included the discontinuation of our liquid oral heparin program and related initiatives, and a reduction of associated infrastructure. The resulting restructuring charge to earnings in 2002 was approximately $1.5 million. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, in connection with the restructuring, we performed an evaluation of certain intangible and fixed assets to determine if their carrying amount exceeded their fair value. In 2002, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.5 million. In 2003, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $5.4 million. We cannot assure you that competitive heparin products will not have an adverse effect on our heparin product development efforts or that future clinical trials related to our solid form of oral heparin will meet targeted endpoints. In 1996, we formed a joint venture with Elan Corporation, plc (Elan) to develop oral forms of heparin. In July 1999, we reacquired all product, marketing and technology rights for our heparin products from Elan. In accordance with the termination agreement with Elan, we will be required to pay Elan royalties on our sales of oral heparin, subject to an annual cap of $10 million. Oral Insulin Insulin delivery is a highly competitive area. Other companies currently are developing and/or have received regulatory approval for buccal or aerosol (pulmonary) forms of insulin (e.g., Pfizer/Nektars EXUBERA®). Our oral insulin product candidate has demonstrated favorable data in early patient studies in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. However, we cannot assure you that future clinical trials related to our oral insulin will meet targeted endpoints, with the result that we may fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approval for sale of oral insulin, either alone or in collaboration with a major pharmaceutical company. We are highly dependent upon collaborative partners to develop and commercialize compounds using our delivery agents. A key part of our strategy is to form collaborations with pharmaceutical companies that will assist us in developing, testing, obtaining government approval for and commercializing oral forms of therapeutic macromolecules using the eligen® technology. We have a collaborative agreement for candidates in clinical development with Novartis. We negotiate specific ownership rights with respect to the intellectual property developed as a result of the collaboration with each partner. While ownership rights vary from program to program, in general we retain ownership rights to developments relating to our carrier and the collaborator retains rights related to the drug product developed. Despite our existing agreements, we cannot assure you that:  we will be able to enter into additional collaborative arrangements to develop products utilizing our drug delivery technology;  any existing or future collaborative arrangements will be sustainable or successful;  the product candidates in collaborative arrangements will be further developed by partners in a timely fashion;  any collaborative partner will not infringe upon our intellectual property position in violation of the terms of the collaboration contract; or  milestones in collaborative agreements will be met and milestone payments will be received. If we are unable to obtain development assistance and funds from other pharmaceutical companies to fund a portion of our product development costs and to commercialize our product candidates, we may be unable to issue equity upon favorable terms to allow us to raise sufficient capital to fund clinical development of our product candidates. Lack of funding would cause us to delay, scale back or curtail clinical development of one or more of our projects. The determination of the specific project to curtail would depend upon the relative future economic value to us of each program. 20 Our collaborative partners control the clinical development of the drug candidates and may terminate their efforts at will. Novartis controls the clinical development of oral salmon calcitonin and oral rhGH. Novartis also has an option to control the clinical development of oral PTH. Genta controls the clinical development of Oral Gallium. Although we influence the clinical program through participation on a Steering Committee for each product, Novartis and Genta control the decision-making for the design and timing of their clinical studies. Moreover, the agreements with Novartis and Genta provide that they may terminate their programs at will for any reason and without any financial penalty or requirement to fund any further clinical studies. We cannot assure you that Novartis or Genta will continue to advance the clinical development of the drug candidates subject to collaboration. Our collaborative partners are free to develop competing products. Aside from provisions preventing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by our collaborative partners, there is nothing in our collaborative agreements that prevents our partners from developing competing products. If one of our partners were to develop a competing product, our collaboration could be substantially jeopardized. Our product candidates are in various stages of development, and we cannot be certain that any will be suitable for commercial purposes. To be profitable, we must successfully research, develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and distribute our products under development, or secure a partner to provide financial and other assistance with these steps. The time necessary to achieve these goals for any individual product is long and uncertain. Before we or a potential partner can sell any of the products currently under development, we must demonstrate through preclinical (animal) studies and clinical (human) trials that each product is safe and effective for human use for each targeted indication. We have never successfully commercialized a drug candidate and we cannot be certain that we or our current or future partners will be able to begin, or continue, planned clinical trials for our product candidates, or if we are able, that the product candidates will prove to be safe and will produce their intended effects. Even if safe and effective, the size of the solid dosage form, taste and frequency of dosage may impede their acceptance by patients. A number of companies in the drug delivery, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in earlier studies or trials. We cannot assure you that favorable results in any preclinical study or early clinical trial will mean that favorable results will ultimately be obtained in future clinical trials. Nor can we assure you that results of limited animal and human studies are indicative of results that would be achieved in future animal studies or human clinical studies, all or some of which will be required in order to have our product candidates obtain regulatory approval. Similarly, we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will be approved by the FDA. Our future business success depends heavily upon regulatory approvals, which can be difficult to obtain for a variety of reasons, including cost. Our preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to extensive, costly and rigorous regulation by various governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining required approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities often takes many years, is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates. We cannot assure you that we, either independently or in collaboration with others, will meet the applicable regulatory criteria in order to receive the required approvals for manufacturing and marketing. Delays in obtaining United States or foreign approvals for our self-developed projects could result in substantial additional costs to us, and, therefore, could adversely affect our ability to compete with other companies. Additionally, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals encountered by others with whom we collaborate also could adversely affect our business and prospects. Even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained, the approval may place limitations on the intended uses of the product, and may restrict the way in which we or our partner may market the product. 21 The regulatory approval process presents several risks to us:  In general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years, and require the expenditure of substantial resources. The data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.  Delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or other data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure of the product to meet, a regulatory agencys requirements for safety, efficacy and quality or, in the case of a product seeking an orphan drug indication, because another designee received approval first.  Requirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy, or the adoption of new regulations or guidelines.  New guidelines can have an effect on the regulatory decisions made in previous years.  The scope of any regulatory approval, when obtained, may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and may impose significant limitations in the nature of warnings, precautions and contraindications that could materially affect the profitability of the drug.  Approved drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to continuing and on-going review, and discovery of problems with these products or the failure to adhere to manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market.  Regulatory authorities and agencies may promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products.  Once a product receives marketing approval, the FDA may not permit us to market that product for broader or different applications, or may not grant us clearance with respect to separate product applications that represent extensions of our basic technology. In addition, the FDA may withdraw or modify existing clearances in a significant manner or promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products. Additionally, we face the risk that our competitors may gain FDA approval for a product before us. Having a competitor reach the market before us would impede the future commercial success for our competing product because we believe that the FDA uses heightened standards of approval for products once approval has been granted to a competing product in a particular product area. We believe that this standard generally limits new approvals to only those products that meet or exceed the standards set by the previously approved product. Our business will suffer if we cannot adequately protect our patent and proprietary rights. Although we have patents for some of our product candidates and have applied for additional patents, there can be no assurance that patents applied for will be granted, that patents granted to or acquired by us now or in the future will be valid and enforceable and provide us with meaningful protection from competition or that we will possess the financial resources necessary to enforce any of our patents. Also, we cannot be certain that any products that we (or a licensee) develop will not infringe upon any patent or other intellectual property right of a third party. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. We maintain a policy of requiring employees, scientific advisors, consultants and collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of a relationship with us. We cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. Part of our strategy involves collaborative arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies for the development of new formulations of drugs developed by others and, ultimately, the receipt of royalties on sales of the new formulations of those drugs. These drugs are generally the property of the pharmaceutical companies and may be the subject of patents or patent applications and other rights of protection owned by the pharmaceutical companies. To the extent those patents or other forms of rights expire, become invalid or otherwise ineffective, or to the extent those drugs are covered by patents or other forms of protection owned by third parties, sales of those drugs by the collaborating pharmaceutical company may be restricted, limited, enjoined, or may cease. Accordingly, the potential for royalty revenues to us may be adversely affected. 22 We may be at risk of having to obtain a license from third parties making proprietary improvements to our technology. There is a possibility that third parties may make improvements or innovations to our technology in a more expeditious manner than we do. Although we are not aware of any such circumstance related to our product portfolio, should such circumstances arise, we may need to obtain a license from such third party to obtain the benefit of the improvement or innovation. Royalties payable under such a license would reduce our share of total revenue. Such a license may not be available to us at all or on commercially reasonable terms. Although we currently do not know of any circumstances related to our product portfolio which would lead us to believe that a third party has developed any improvements or innovation with respect to our technology, we cannot assure you that such circumstances will not arise in the future. We cannot reasonably determine the cost to us of the effect of being unable to obtain any such license. We are dependent on third parties to manufacture and, in some cases, test our products. We have a facility to manufacture a limited quantity of clinical supplies containing EMISPHERE® delivery agents. Currently, we have no manufacturing facilities for production of any therapeutic compounds under consideration as products. We have no facilities for clinical testing. The success of our self-developed programs is dependent upon securing manufacturing capabilities and contracting with clinical service and other service providers. The availability of manufacturers is limited by both the capacity of such manufacturers and their regulatory compliance. Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturers quality control and manufacturing procedures continually conform with the FDAs current GMP (GMP are regulations established by the FDA that govern the manufacture, processing, packing, storage and testing of drugs intended for human use). In complying with GMP, manufacturers must devote extensive time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control and quality assurance to maintain full technical compliance. Manufacturing facilities and company records are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to ensure compliance. If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with these requirements, regulatory enforcement action may be taken by the FDA, which may include seeking an injunction against shipment of products from the facility and recall of products previously shipped from the facility. Such actions could severely delay our ability to obtain product from that particular source. The success of our clinical trials and our partnerships is dependent on the proposed or current partners capacity and ability to adequately manufacture drug products to meet the proposed demand of each respective market. Any significant delay in obtaining a supply source (which could result from, for example, an FDA determination that such manufacturer does not comply with current GMP) could harm our potential for success. Additionally, if a current manufacturer were to lose its ability to meet our supply demands during a clinical trial, the trial may be delayed or may even need to be abandoned. We may face product liability claims related to participation in clinical trials or future products. We have product liability insurance with a policy limit of $3 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. The testing, manufacture and marketing of products for humans utilizing our drug delivery technology may expose us to potential product liability and other claims. These may be claims directly by consumers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling our future products. We seek to structure development programs with pharmaceutical companies that would complete the development, manufacturing and marketing of the finished product in a manner that would protect us from such liability, but the indemnity undertakings for product liability claims that we secure from the pharmaceutical companies may prove to be insufficient. We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations for which we incur costs to comply. We use some hazardous materials in our research and development activities and are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing the use of such materials. For example, our operations involve the controlled use of chemicals, biologicals and radioactive materials and we bear the costs of complying with the various regulations governing the use of such materials. Costs of compliance have not been material to date. While we believe we are currently in compliance with the federal, state and local laws governing the use of such materials, we cannot be certain that accidental injury or contamination will not occur. Should we be held liable or face regulatory actions regarding an accident involving personal injury or an environmental release, we potentially could incur costs in excess of our resources or insurance coverage, although, to date, we have not had to deal with any such actions. During each of 2004, 2005 and 2006, we incurred costs of approximately $200 thousand in our compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. 23 We face rapid technological change and intense competition. Our success depends, in part, upon maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in an evolving field in which developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace. We compete with other drug delivery, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, individual scientists and non-profit organizations engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing, as well as with entities developing new drugs that may be orally active. Many of these competitors have greater research and development capabilities, experience, and marketing, financial and managerial resources than we have, and, therefore, represent significant competition. Our products, when developed and marketed, may compete with existing parenteral or other versions of the same drug, some of which are well established in the marketplace and manufactured by formidable competitors, as well as other existing drugs. For example, our oral heparin product candidate, if successful, would compete with intravenous heparin, injectable low molecular weight heparin and oral warfarin, as well as the recently approved injectable pentasaccharide product. These products are marketed throughout the world by leading pharmaceutical companies such as Aventis Pharma SA, Pfizer, Inc. and Bristol Myers Squibb Company. Similarly, our salmon calcitonin product candidate, if developed and marketed, would compete with a wide array of existing osteoporosis therapies, including a nasal dosage form of salmon calcitonin, estrogen replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, bisphosphonates and other compounds in development. Our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining government approval for products before we do. Developments by others may render our product candidates, or the therapeutic macromolecules used in combination with our product candidates, noncompetitive or obsolete. At least one competitor has notified the FDA that it is developing a competing formulation of salmon calcitonin. We cannot assure you that, if our products are marketed, they will be preferred to existing drugs or that they will be preferred to or available before other products in development. If a competitor announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or an approval by a regulatory agency of the marketing of a competitive product, such announcement may have a material adverse effect on our operations or future prospects resulting from reduced sales of future products that we may wish to bring to market or from an adverse impact on the price of our common stock or our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial organizations, our business will be harmed. We are highly dependent on our executive officers. On January 12, 2007, the Board of Directors appointed Lewis H. Bender as President and Chief Executive Officer on an interim basis. Mr. Bender has been with Emisphere since 1993. Prior to his appointment, Mr. Bender was the Senior Vice President of Business Development. The Board of Directors placed our former Chairman and CEO, Michael Goldberg, M.D., on leave effective January 12, 2007 and terminated Dr. Goldberg effective on January 16, 2007. A search for a permanent CEO is ongoing. The loss of other officers could have an adverse effect as well, given their specific knowledge related to our proprietary technology and personal relationships with our pharmaceutical company partners. If we are not able to retain our executive officers, our business may suffer. None of our key officers are nearing retirement age or have announced any intention to leave Emisphere. We do not maintain key-man life insurance policies for any of our executive officers. There is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the development, manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business. Additionally, because of the knowledge and experience of our scientific personnel and their specific knowledge with respect to our drug carriers the continued development of our product candidates could be adversely affected by the loss of any significant number of such personnel. Provisions of our corporate charter documents, Delaware law and our stockholder rights plan may dissuade potential acquirors, prevent the replacement or removal of our current management and may thereby affect the price of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Of these 1,000,000 shares, 200,000 are currently designated Series A Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock (A Preferred Stock) in connection with our stockholder rights plan, and the remaining 800,000 shares remain available for future issuance. Rights of holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. 24 We also have a stockholder rights plan, commonly referred to as a poison pill, in which Preferred Stock Purchase Rights (the Rights) have been granted at the rate of one one-hundredth of a share of A Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $80 for each share of our common stock. The Rights are not exercisable or transferable apart from the common stock, until the earlier of (i) ten days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons have acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of our outstanding common stock or (ii) ten business days (or such later date, as defined) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person, or group, of 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. If we enter into consolidation, merger, or other business combinations, as defined, each Right would entitle the holder upon exercise to receive, in lieu of shares of A Preferred Stock, a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a value of two times the exercise price of the Right, as defined. By potentially diluting the ownership of the acquiring company, our rights plan may dissuade prospective acquirors of our company. MHR is specifically excluded from the provisions of the plan. The A Preferred Stockholders will be entitled to a preferential cumulative quarterly dividend of the greater of $1.00 per share or 100 times the per-share dividend declared on our stock and are also entitled to a liquidation preference, thereby hindering an acquirors ability to freely pay dividends or to liquidate the company following an acquisition. Each A Preferred Stock share will have 100 votes and will vote together with the common shares, effectively preventing an acquiror from removing existing management. The Rights contain anti-dilutive provisions and are redeemable at our option, subject to certain defined restrictions for $.01 per Right. The Rights expire on April 7, 2016. Provisions of our corporate charter documents, Delaware law and financing agreements may prevent the replacement or removal of our current management and members of our Board of Directors and may thereby affect the price of our common stock. In connection with the MHR financing transaction, and after approval by our Board of Directors, Dr. Mark H. Rachesky was appointed to the Board of Directors by MHR (the MHR Nominee) and Dr. Michael Weiser was appointed to the Board of Directors by both the majority of our Board of Directors and MHR (the Mutual Director), as contemplated by our recently amended by-laws that also require the unanimous consent of the Board. Our certificate of incorporation provides that the MHR Nominee and the Mutual Director may be removed only by the affirmative vote of at least 85% of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that the MHR Nominee may be replaced only by an individual designated by MHR, unless the MHR Nominee has been removed for cause, in which case the MHR Nominee may be replaced only by an individual approved by both a majority of our Board of Directors and MHR. Furthermore, the amendments to the by-laws and the certificate of incorporation provide that the rights granted to MHR by these amendments may not be amended or repealed without the unanimous vote or unanimous written consent of the Board of Directors or the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 85% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the election of directors. The amendments to the by-laws and the certificate of incorporation will remain in effect as long as MHR holds at least 2% of the shares of fully diluted Common Stock. The amendments to the by-laws and the certificate of incorporation will have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Additional provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock. These include provisions that classify our Board of Directors, limit the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent, call special meetings, remove a director for cause, amend the by-laws or approve a merger with another company. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. For purposes of Section 203, a business combination includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder, and an interested stockholder is a person who, either alone or together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within the past three years, did own) 15% or more of the corporations voting stock. 25 Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. The trading price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. The market prices for securities of drug delivery, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile.
