ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. IF OUR MECHANICAL HEART VALVE DOES NOT ACHIEVE WIDESPREAD MARKET ACCEPTANCE IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE HARMED AND WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. Our success will depend, in large part, on the medical community's acceptance of the ATS mechanical heart valve in the United States, which is the largest revenue market in the world for heart valves. The U.S. medical community's acceptance of the ATS heart valve will depend upon our ability to demonstrate the safety and efficacy, advantages, long-term clinical performance and cost-effectiveness of the ATS heart valve as compared to other prosthetic heart valves. We cannot predict whether the U.S. medical community will accept the ATS heart valve or, 14 if accepted, the extent of its use. Negative publicity resulting from isolated incidents involving the ATS heart valve or other prosthetic heart valves could have a significant adverse effect on the overall acceptance of our heart valve. If we encounter difficulties developing a market for the ATS heart valve in the United States, we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to achieve profitability, and our business and operating results will be seriously harmed. WE CURRENTLY RELY ON THE ATS HEART VALVE AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF REVENUE. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN SELLING THIS PRODUCT, OUR OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE HARMED. While we commenced marketing additional products during 2005 that totaled 18% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 there can be no assurance that these new products will decrease our dependence on the sales of mechanical heart valves. Increasing revenues from new products cannot be guaranteed. Even if we were to develop additional products, regulatory approval would likely be required to sell them. Clinical testing and the approval process itself are very expensive and can take many years. Therefore, we do not expect to be in a position to sell additional products in the foreseeable future. Adverse rulings by regulatory authorities, product liability lawsuits, the failure to achieve widespread U.S. market acceptance, the loss of market acceptance outside of the United States, or other adverse publicity may significantly and adversely affect our sales of the ATS heart valve, and, as a result, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF ACQUIRING 3F MAY NOT BE REALIZED. We completed the acquisition of 3F on September 29, 2006 and expect that the merger will result in various benefits, including, among others, an expanded heart valve product line, enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for ATS in the heart valve industry, cross-selling opportunities, technology, cost savings and operating efficiencies. However, achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether 3F's development-stage products are ultimately marketable, whether we are able to integrate 3F in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, and could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING 3F AND MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTEGRATION. Integrating 3F's operations into our business will be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Before the merger, ATS and 3F operated independently, each with its own business, products, customers, employees, culture and systems. We may experience material unanticipated difficulties or expenses in connection with the integration of 3F due to various factors, including: - retaining and integrating management and other key employees of the combined company; - costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures and integrating 3F's products and operations into our business; - difficulty comparing financial reports due to differing financial and accounting systems; - diversion of management resources from the business of the combined company; - reduction or loss of customer sales due to the potential for market confusion, hesitation and delay; and - difficulty in combining distribution arrangements for the combined company's products and services. 15 We do not have experience in integrating operations on the scale represented by the merger with 3F, and it is not certain that we can successfully integrate 3F in a timely or efficient manner, or at all, or that any of the anticipated benefits of the merger will be realized. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and operating results of the combined company. In addition, many of the factors listed above are outside the control of either company. The time and expense associated with converting the businesses into a single, combined company may exceed management's expectations and limit or delay the intended benefits of the transaction. To the extent any of these events occur, the benefits of the transaction may be reduced, at least for a period of time. In addition, it is possible that unexpected transaction costs, such as taxes, fees or professional expenses, or unexpected future operating expenses, such as increased personnel costs, as well as other types of unanticipated adverse developments, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. IN 2002, WE BEGAN USING A COMBINATION OF DIRECT SALES PERSONS AND INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURING REPRESENTATIVES TO SELL OUR VALVES IN THE UNITED STATES. IF OUR U.S. SALES STRATEGY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AS PLANNED. Our sales approach for the sale of the ATS heart valve in the United States consists primarily of direct salespersons with a few independent manufacturers' representatives. We will need to continue to expend significant funds and management resources to develop and maintain this hybrid sales force. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel and independent manufacturing representatives with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate qualified personnel and representatives, U.S. sales of the ATS heart valve could be adversely affected. The loss of key salespersons or independent manufacturer's representatives could have a material adverse effect on our sales or potential sales to current customers and prospects serviced by such salespersons or representatives. Further, we cannot assure the successful expansion of our network of independent manufacturer's representatives on terms acceptable to ATS, if at all, or the successful marketing of our products by our hybrid sales force. To the extent we rely on sales through independent manufacturer's representatives, any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of these parties. We do not control the amount and timing of marketing resources that these third parties devote to our product. If our U.S. sales strategy is not successful, we may be forced to change our U.S. sales strategy again. Any such change could disrupt sales in the United States. Further, any change in our U.S. sales strategy could be expensive and would likely have a material adverse impact on our operating results. WE CURRENTLY DEPEND ON THE MARKETING AND SALES EFFORTS OF INTERNATIONAL INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. The ATS mechanical and tissue heart valves are sold internationally through independent distributors. The loss of an international distributor could seriously harm our business and operating results if a new distributor could not be found on a timely basis in the relevant geographic market. We do not control the amount and timing of marketing resources that these third parties devote to our product. Furthermore, to the extent we rely on sales through independent distributors, any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of these parties. WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS INCLUDING A DROP IN SALES DUE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. For the year ended December 31, 2006, 61% of our net sales were derived from international operations. We expect that international sales will account for a substantial majority of our revenue until the ATS mechanical heart valve receives wider market acceptance from U.S. customers and until 3F obtains pre-market approval to sell its 3F Aortic Bioprosthesis or other products in the United States. Accordingly, any material decrease in foreign sales may materially and adversely affect our operating results. We sell in U.S. dollars to most of our customers abroad. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies can and has adversely affected our sales outside of the United States. In prior years, the decrease in sales was due primarily to the change in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, as well as competitor price pressure. Our dependence on sales outside of the United States will continue to expose us to U.S. dollar currency fluctuations for the foreseeable future. 16 Our future operating results could also be harmed by risks inherent in doing business in international markets, including: - unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements and government health programs; - weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries; - new export license requirements, changes in tariffs or trade restrictions; - political and economic instability in our target markets; - greater difficulty in collecting payments from product sales; and - lengthy/extended credit terms WE HAVE A HISTORY OF NET LOSSES. IF WE DO NOT HAVE NET INCOME IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. We are not currently profitable and have a very limited history of profitability. We had net losses of approximately $16.6 million for the 2004 fiscal year, $14.4 million for the 2005 fiscal year and $27.7 million for the 2006 fiscal year. As of December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $109.6 million. We expect to incur significant expenses over the next several years as we continue to devote substantial resources to the commercialization and marketing of the ATS heart valve in the United States. We will not generate net income unless we are able to significantly increase revenue from U.S. sales. If we continue to sustain losses, we may not be able to continue our business as planned. In addition, if the benefits of the merger with 3F do not exceed the associated costs, the combined company could be adversely affected by incurring additional or even increased losses from its operations. Our ability to succeed after the merger depends on making our combined operations profitable through increased revenue and reduced expenses for the combined company. If we fail to make our combined operations profitable through increased revenue and decreased expenses, it would harm our business, financial condition and operating results. PURCHASE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER WITH 3F COULD RESULT IN NET LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We have accounted for the merger with 3F using the purchase method of accounting. Under purchase accounting, the estimated market value of shares of our common stock issued in the merger and the amount of the merger transaction costs will be recorded as the cost of acquiring 3F. That cost has been allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology, acquired trademarks and tradenames, based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets has been allocated as goodwill. The amount of initial purchase price currently allocated to goodwill and the other intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of 3F is approximately $12.2 million. Our estimates are based upon currently available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. We continue the process of gathering information to finalize the valuation of certain assets, primarily the valuation of acquired intangible assets. However, there can be no assurance that the actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the current estimates. The amortization of other intangible assets could result in net losses for ATS for the foreseeable future, which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF REGULARLY RAISING FUNDS AND INCURRING DEBT TO FUND NET LOSSES. IF OUR CURRENT CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES ARE INADEQUATE TO CARRY US TO PROFITABILITY, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY OR INCUR DEBT IN THE FUTURE. During the last three years, we have completed financings to fund our operations. If our future operations require greater cash than our current balances, we would again be required to raise equity or issue debt. Furthermore, there may be delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals of our products or introducing products to market or other events that may cause actual cash requirements to exceed those for which we have budgeted. In such event, we would need additional financing. If we were unable to raise these funds, we may not be able to continue our business as planned. 17 THE MARKET FOR PROSTHETIC HEART VALVES IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND A NUMBER OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE LARGER AND HAVE MORE FINANCIAL RESOURCES. IF WE DO NOT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED. The market for prosthetic heart valves is highly competitive. We expect that competition will intensify as additional companies enter the market or modify their existing products to compete directly with us. Our primary competitor in mechanical heart valves, St. Jude Medical, Inc., currently controls approximately 50% of the worldwide market. Edwards Lifesciences PVT, Inc., our primary competitor in the tissue heart valve market, currently controls approximately 60% of the worldwide market. Many of our competitors have long-standing FDA approval for their valves and extensive clinical data demonstrating the performance of their valves. In addition, they have greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and research and development capabilities than we have. For example, many of our competitors have the ability, due to their internal carbon manufacturing facilities and economies of scale, to manufacture their heart valves at a lower cost than we can manufacture our ATS heart valve. Our primary competitor has recently used price as a method to compete in several international markets. If heart valve prices decline significantly, we might not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results. OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE HARMED IF THE USE OF MECHANICAL HEART VALVES DECLINES OR IF OUR TISSUE HEART VALVES CANNOT BE SUCCESSFULLY MARKETED. Our business could suffer if the use of mechanical heart valves declines. Historically, mechanical heart valves have accounted for over two-thirds of all heart valve replacements. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of tissue valves. We estimate that mechanical heart valves are currently being used in 40% to 65% of all heart valve replacements, depending on the geographic market, down from 65% to 75% roughly ten years ago. We believe the tissue manufacturers' claims of improvements in tissue valve longevity and an increase in the average age of valve patients have contributed to the recent increase in the use of tissue valves. In addition, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully market and sell our tissue heart valves or that our tissue heart valves will be approved or gain market acceptance. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR STRATEGIC DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS. In 2006, revenues from non-mechanical heart valve products increased to 18% of total revenue from 0% in 2004. Some of our distributed products contain performance criteria which we must obtain to retain our rights under these arrangements. Additionally, these arrangements provide certain circumstances under which our rights may be terminated (i.e. change-in-control). If we are unable to maintain these arrangements, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. WE ULTIMATELY MAY EXPERIENCE A DELAY IN INTRODUCING, OR MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT OF, PRODUCTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, RESULTING IN HARM TO OUR BUSINESS. We are in the process of developing certain products, including but not limited to, the Enable and Entrata products. The Enable product is currently in the early phases of clinical trials, and the Entrata product is still under development. Successfully completing the development of these products and technologies presents substantial technical, medical and engineering challenges, as well as regulatory hurdles. In 2006, ongoing clinical trial results in Europe resulted in our undertaking a review of the Enable valve cuff design. We may not successfully complete the development of these products, or these products may fail to work in the manner intended. If we are unable to successfully develop the products that are currently under development, we may suffer financial difficulties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. NEW PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY OTHERS COULD RENDER OUR PRODUCT OBSOLETE. The medical device industry is characterized by significant technological advances. Several companies are developing new prosthetic heart valves based on new or potentially improved technologies. Significant advances are also being made in surgical procedures, which may delay the need for replacement heart valves. A new product or technology may emerge that renders the ATS heart valve noncompetitive or obsolete. This could materially harm our operating results or force us to cease doing business altogether. 18 THE MERGER WITH 3F MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. Some customers may seek alternative sources of products and/or services after the effectiveness of the 3F merger due to, among other reasons, a desire not to do business with the combined company or perceived concerns that the combined company may not continue to support and develop certain product lines. The combined company could experience some customer attrition after the merger. Difficulties in combining operations also could result in the loss of providers and potential disputes or litigation with customers, providers or others. WE LICENSE PATENTED TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS FROM CARBOMEDICS. IF THESE AGREEMENTS ARE BREACHED OR TERMINATED, OUR RIGHT TO MANUFACTURE THE ATS MECHANICAL HEART VALVE COULD BE TERMINATED. Under our carbon technology agreement with CarboMedics, we have obtained a license to use CarboMedics' pyrolytic carbon technology to manufacture components for the ATS heart valve. If this agreement is breached or terminated, we would be unable to manufacture our own product. If our inventory is exhausted and we do not have any other sources of carbon components, we would be forced to cease doing business. A DELAY OR INTERRUPTION IN OUR MANUFACTURING OF PYROLYTIC CARBON COMPONENTS COULD DELAY PRODUCT DELIVERY OR FORCE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS. Although we anticipate that our manufacturing capacity will be sufficient to meet our current and foreseeable carbon component needs, if our inventory is exhausted and we are unable to manufacture carbon components, it is unlikely that we will be able to obtain the necessary carbon components from any other source. If we are unable to obtain these carbon components from other sources, we could be forced to reduce or cease operations. BECAUSE WE LACK MANUFACTURING EXPERIENCE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS FROM MANUFACTURING OUR OWN PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, WE COULD EXPERIENCE PRODUCTION DELAYS AND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS. Under our agreement with CarboMedics, we have been granted an exclusive worldwide license to manufacture pyrolytic carbon components for the ATS heart valve. We cannot be certain that our strategy to establish internal manufacturing capabilities will result in a cost-effective means for manufacturing the ATS heart valve. We have limited experience in manufacturing pyrolytic carbon. Although we have an FDA-approved carbon manufacturing facility, we have only started increasing our production. In the future, as we continue to increase production, we may encounter difficulties in maintaining and expanding our manufacturing operations, including problems involving: - production yields; - quality control; - per unit manufacturing costs; - shortages of qualified personnel; and - compliance with FDA and international regulations and requirements regarding good manufacturing practices. Difficulties encountered by us in establishing or maintaining a commercial-scale manufacturing facility may limit our ability to manufacture our heart valve and therefore could seriously harm our business, financial condition and operating results. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED IF THIRD-PARTY PAYERS DO NOT REIMBURSE THE COSTS FOR OUR HEART VALVE. Our ability to successfully commercialize the ATS mechanical heart valve depends on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our product and the related surgical procedure is available from third-party payers, such as governmental programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and procedures that they consider not to be cost-effective or are used for a non-approved indication. The failure by physicians, hospitals and other users of our products to 19 obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payers would seriously harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In recent years, there have been numerous proposals to change the health care system in the United States. Some of these proposals have included measures that would limit or eliminate payment for medical procedures or treatments. In addition, government and private third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the coverage and the level of reimbursement. In international markets, reimbursement and health care payment systems vary significantly by country. Furthermore, we have encountered price resistance from government-administered health programs. Significant changes in the health care system in the United States or elsewhere, including changes resulting from adverse trends in third-party reimbursement programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. WE MAY FACE PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOSSES IN EXCESS OF OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE AND WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS. The manufacture and sale of mechanical heart valves and tissue heart valves entails significant risk of product liability claims and product recalls. Both mechanical heart valves and tissue heart valves are life-sustaining devices, and the failure of any mechanical heart valve usually results in the patient's death or need for re-operation. A product liability claim or product recall, regardless of the ultimate outcome, could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages and could seriously harm our business. We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in an aggregate amount of $25 million. However, we cannot be assured that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover the costs of any product liability claims made against us. Product liability insurance is expensive and does not cover the costs of a product recall. In the future, product liability insurance may not be available at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts. A product liability claim or product recall could also materially and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce our patents and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. These measures afford only limited protection, and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. The patent positions of medical device companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and technical issues. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any litigation could be costly and divert our attention from the growth of the business. We cannot assure you that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be successfully challenged, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent information and technology or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. WE MAY BE SUED BY THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING THAT OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. ANY SUCH SUITS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION OR LICENSING EXPENSES OR WE MIGHT BE PREVENTED FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCT. We may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on intellectual property infringement claims. Any claims or litigation against us, regardless of the merits, could result in substantial costs and could harm our business. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to: - cease manufacturing and selling our product, which would seriously harm us; - obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; or - redesign our product, which could be costly and time-consuming. WE MAY ENCOUNTER LITIGATION THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. In addition to product liability claims, potential litigation over intellectual property infringement claims and the CarboMedics litigation described in Item 3. "Legal Proceedings," we also may be subject to other lawsuits, proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. Although we do not believe that any 20 lawsuits, claims or proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business will have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition, it is possible that unfavorable resolutions of any lawsuits, claims or proceedings could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition because of the uncertainty inherent in litigation. WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION, WHICH IS COSTLY, TIME CONSUMING AND CAN SUBJECT US TO UNANTICIPATED DELAYS OR COULD ULTIMATELY PRECLUDE US FROM MARKETING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS. Our heart valve and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including the FDA and comparable international agencies, as well as other federal, state, local and international authorities. We are required to: - obtain the approval of the FDA or international regulatory authorities where our heart valves are not yet marketed; - after obtaining approval or clearance of the FDA or international regulatory authorities, maintain the approval of the FDA and international regulatory authorities to continue selling and manufacturing our heart valves; - satisfy content requirements for all of our labeling, sales and promotional materials; - comply with manufacturing and reporting requirements; and - undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies. Compliance with the regulations of these governmental authorities may delay or prevent us from introducing any new or improved products. The governmental authorities in charge of making and implementing these laws or related regulations may change the laws, impose additional restrictions, or adopt interpretations of existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on us. Violations of these laws or regulatory requirements may result in fines, marketing restrictions, product recall, withdrawal of approvals and civil and criminal penalties. We also may incur substantial costs associated with complying and overseeing compliance with the laws and regulations of these governmental authorities. We ultimately may not be able to obtain the necessary governmental approvals or clearances in the United States or other jurisdictions, including FDA and CE approvals and clearances, for products that are now under development, including our 3F Aortic Bioprosthesis, Enable and Entrata products. Obtaining these governmental approvals or clearances is uncertain, and the regulatory approval process is likely to be time-consuming and expensive. If we are unable to obtain such governmental approvals or clearances, then our ability to market and sell products currently under development may be delayed or may never occur. Our potential inability to market and sell our products currently under development, together with the potential expenses associated with obtaining the necessary governmental approvals or clearances, may cause us to suffer financial difficulties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN VOLATILE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN LOSSES TO INVESTORS. Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted by the following: - the success of our management in operating ATS effectively; - the failure of our heart valves to gain market acceptance in the United States; - announcements of technical innovations or new products by our competitors; - the status of component supply arrangements; - changes in reimbursement policies; - government regulation; - developments in patent or other proprietary rights; 21 - public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and - general market conditions. In addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors, in future years our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Finally, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND MINNESOTA LAW MAY DISCOURAGE AND COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A TAKEOVER OF OUR COMPANY. Provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Minnesota law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions include the following: - No cumulative voting by shareholders for directors; - The ability of our Board of Directors to control its size, to create new directorships and to fill vacancies; - The ability of our Board of Directors, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock, which may have rights and preferences that are superior to our common stock; - The ability of our Board of Directors to amend the bylaws; and - Restrictions under Minnesota law regarding mergers or other business combinations between us and any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not Applicable.
