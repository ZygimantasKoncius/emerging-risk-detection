D. Risk Factors in this annual report. This annual report also contains data related to the solar power market in several countries, including China. This market data, including data from independent solar energy industry research companies, such as PVinsights, includes projections that are based on a number of assumptions. The solar power market may not grow at the rates projected by the market data, or at all. The failure of the market to grow at the projected rates may materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our ADSs and equity-linked securities. In addition, the rapidly changing nature of the solar power market subjects any projections or estimates relating to the growth prospects or future condition of our market to significant uncertainties. If any one or more of the assumptions underlying the market data proves to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the projections based on these assumptions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 3 Table of Contents We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described in the forward-looking statements will happen as described or that they will happen at all. You should read this annual report completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. The forward-looking statements made in this annual report relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made or, if obtained from third-party studies or reports, the date of the corresponding study or report. Since we operate in an emerging and evolving environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We undertake no obligation, beyond that required by law, to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made, even though our situation will change in the future. Whether actual results will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and reflect future business decisions that are subject to change. All forward-looking statements contained in this annual report are qualified by reference to this cautionary statement. 4 Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1.

(3) Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 included $19,278,000, $7,690,000, $2,161,000, $648,000 and $90,000, respectively, related to interest and the amortization of issuance costs and debt discount of our 2013 convertible notes. (4) Our Chinese subsidiary, Jiangxi LDK Solar, is entitled to a tax holiday of two-year full tax exemption followed by three-year 50% reduction in the income tax rate starting from 2006 under the then effective tax rules and regulations. Such tax holiday is grandfathered by the Chinese Enterprise Income Tax Law effective since January 1, 2008 and its relevant regulations. Without this tax holiday, our income tax expense would have increased and our net income and net income available to our shareholders would have been reduced by approximately $44,561,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our basic earnings per share would have been reduced by $0.35 for the year ended December 31, 2010, and our diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by $0.33 for the year ended December 31, 2010. (5) Without the gain on troubled debt restructuring, our net loss and net loss available to our shareholders would have been increased by approximately $10,510,000, $4,645,000 and $96,495,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Our basic loss per share and our diluted loss per share would have been increased by $0.08, $0.03, and $0.49 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. 7 Table of Contents The following table presents our selected consolidated balance sheet data as of the dates specified.

B. CAPITALIZATION AND INDEBTEDNESS Not applicable. C. REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND USE OF PROCEEDS Not applicable. D. RISK FACTORS Investment in our securities including our ADSs, shares and equity-linked securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties, together with other information contained in this annual report, before you decide whether to buy or hold our securities. Risks Relating to Our Company and Our Industry We have recently completed an offshore restructuring pursuant to orders of the Cayman court; and we are faced with considerable challenges in the implementation of the restructuring transactions. We went into provisional liquidation on February 27, 2014 when the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, or the Cayman court, appointed joint provisional liquidators, or the JPLs, pursuant to a winding-up petition we filed with the Cayman court on February 21, 2014 on grounds of insolvency in anticipation of our inability to honor our payment obligations under the Rmb-denominated US$-settled 10% senior notes due 2014, or the 2014 senior notes, and our inability to honor the redemption rights of the holders of 240 million series A redeemable convertible preferred shares, par value $0.10 each, of LDK Silicon, or the LDK Silicon preferred shares. Provisional liquidation is a procedure available under the Cayman Islands law that we have used to protect our company from its creditors in order to allow our company an opportunity to reach a compromise or arrangement with its creditors. In collaboration with the JPLs, we prepared schemes of arrangement in the Cayman Islands and in Hong Kong, or our schemes of arrangement, which were eventually approved by our scheme creditors in the Cayman Islands and in Hong Kong and sanctioned respectively by the Cayman court on November 7, 2014 and by the High Court of Hong Kong, or the Hong Kong court, on November 18, 2014. Our schemes of arrangement became effective on December 10, 2014. You may find additional information under Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  A. Operating Results  Provisional Liquidation in this annual report. 9 Table of Contents In addition, in collaboration with the JPLs, we instituted a bankruptcy proceeding for LDK Solar under Chapter 15 of Title 11 of the United States Code, or the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and proceedings relating to a prepackaged plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code for three of our United States subsidiaries. On November 21, 2014, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, entered an order to recognize and enforce our Cayman scheme of arrangement relating to LDK Solar in the United States and the related Cayman court sanctioning order. On the same date, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court entered another order to confirm our prepackaged plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 cases. The effective date of the prepackaged plan of reorganization occurred on December 10, 2014, in accordance with its terms. On February 18, 2015, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court entered final decrees to close our Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceeding and our Chapter 11 cases. On April 21, 2015, the JPLs were discharged from their duties and the winding-up petition we filed on February 21, 2014 was dismissed pursuant to an order issued by the Cayman court on April 7, 2015. Despite the completion of our multi-jurisdictional restructuring exercises, we will continue to face considerable challenges in our implementation of the restructuring transactions contemplated by our schemes of arrangement and in meeting the requirements of the restructuring transactions. For instance, because we were not able to cash out much of the claims of our scheme creditors, we agreed to issue convertible securities instead in accordance with the terms of our schemes of arrangement. This arrangement will not only continue to keep our indebtedness at a high level, it will also pose a significant threat in disrupting our capital structure from time to time as a result of the periodic conversions by our convertible holders and the dilution of our shareholding structure caused by such periodic conversions. As we have disclosed in  Risks Relating to Our ADSs, Shares and Equity-linked Securities  The offshore restructuring transactions completed under our schemes of arrangement will cause significant dilution to the equity ownership of our shareholders, which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs and equity-linked securities in this annual report, since quite a few of our convertible holders possess power to convert such convertible securities and cause a change of control in our shareholding structure, we are placed under a constant and significant threat that a change of control may occur as a result of the conversions by any such substantial convertible holder. We are operating, and will continue to operate, with a significant working capital deficit; there exist substantial doubts and uncertainties as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We had a working capital deficit (being our total consolidated current liabilities exceeding our total consolidated current assets) of $3,145.0 million, $4,468.9 million and $3,899.5 million as of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We also had a deficit in total equity of $2,102.4 million and $2,312.4 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $1,052.1 million, $1,637.2 million and $269.7 million in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $17.9 million, with the majority of our cash and cash equivalents held by our subsidiaries in China. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, our total liabilities amounted to $5,267.3 million, with outstanding short-term borrowings of $2,839.3 million and most of which were the obligations of our subsidiaries in China. Although we have been released from many of the financial and other restrictions contained in the 2014 senior notes and the LDK Silicon preferred shares through the provisional liquidation, and although a significant amount of our indebtedness onshore China has been subject to a standstill and forbearance arrangement with our onshore creditors as we disclosed in the risk factor  We have substantial existing indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our outstanding and future debt obligations; and we may not be able to refinance our current borrowings on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all below, there continue to exist substantial doubts and uncertainties about our ability to continue as a going concern. These doubts and uncertainties largely arise from our substantial existing indebtedness in China, in particular short-term indebtedness, and the necessity for us to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, whether to refinance our outstanding and future debt obligations or to fund our capital expenditure and working capital 10 Table of Contents requirements. As we conduct our principal business operations through our operating subsidiaries onshore China, virtually all of our onshore plants, properties, equipment and land use rights have been pledged to Chinese onshore creditors as collateral. The volatility and potential deterioration of the PV market conditions and the overall global economies have also added uncertainties regarding the sustainability of the PV industry and adverse impact on the demand for our products. These doubts and uncertainties may create concerns for our creditors, suppliers, customers and other counterparties, and cause them to make it more difficult for us to raise our financing, conduct our business and meet our debt and other obligations. Moreover, our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these doubts and uncertainties, and the adjustments could be substantial. Although we have formulated a liquidity plan as summarized under Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  A. Operating Results  Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations  Ability to seek additional financing for our operations and to execute our liquidity plan, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute such liquidity plan. The amount of liquidity that we may need may be greater than we currently anticipate as a result of additional factors and events beyond our control, such as global economic slowdown, continued downturn in the global PV market, potential financial crises globally or in any region where we conduct a significant portion of our business, changes in the regulatory and business environments, including international trade-related sanctions, which may prevent us from operating normally or from effectively competing in the PV industry. All of these and other factors and occurrences may increase our cash requirements and make us unable to satisfy our liquidity requirements and we may, as a result, be unable to continue as a going concern. We have substantial existing indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our outstanding and future debt obligations; and we may not be able to refinance our current borrowings on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We not only had a working capital deficit for the past years, we also had, and will continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness as we disclosed above. As of December 31, 2014, our total liabilities amounted to $5,267.3 million, with outstanding short-term borrowings of $2,839.3 million and no outstanding long-term borrowings. A significant amount of our indebtedness onshore China has been subject to a standstill and forbearance arrangement with our onshore creditors. Although we have not been servicing such forborne indebtedness onshore China, it has been existing as well as accruing interests on our books. We may, however, incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time to support our operations. If we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt, the risks that we face as a result of our indebtedness and leverage could intensify. Our substantial existing debt and the incurrence of any additional debt could:  limit our ability to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments, including our convertible securities;  increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repaying indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes;  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the businesses and the industries in which we operate;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt;  increase our exposure to interest rate fluctuations;  limit our ability to borrow additional funds and impose additional financial and other restrictions on us; and  increase the cost of additional financing. 11 Table of Contents Because the majority of our indebtedness is short-term indebtedness, we may suffer a near-term liquidity problem if we are unable to refinance these borrowings as they become due or if our onshore lenders decide to terminate their standstill and forbearance arrangements. As of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, our outstanding short-term borrowings (including current portion of long-term borrowings) were $2,391.3 million, $2,525.4 million and $2,839.3 million, respectively, and our short-term borrowings (excluding the current portion of long-term borrowings) bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.05%, 6.03% and 5.50%, respectively. Generally, our short-term loans contain no specific renewal terms, although we have historically negotiated renewals of some of our loans shortly before they would mature. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our loans in the future as they mature or that our onshore lenders will indefinitely agree to standstill and forbear with respect to their significant credit exposure to us. If we are unable to obtain renewals of any future loans or sufficient alternative funding on reasonable terms, or if our lenders onshore China decide to terminate their standstill and forbearance arrangements with us, we will have to repay, and are not likely able to repay, these borrowings. Our ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our outstanding and future debt and other obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Although we had positive operating cash flow of $39.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded negative operating cash flow of $174.1 million and $125.1 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. As such, we cannot assure you that we will have positive net cash flow from operating activities in the future. The Chinese banks and financial institutions may have concerns in continuing to provide or renew financing for our operations as a result of the threat of our leverage, especially given the fact that a significant portion of their lendings to us has remained unpaid and unserviced for a few years by now and will continue for an indeterminate period of time. The Chinese government may also pass measures to tighten credit available in the Chinese market. Further and future monetary tightening measures in China as well as other monetary, fiscal and industrial policy changes by the Chinese government could materially and adversely affect our cost and availability of financing, our liquidity and access to capital, and our ability to operate our business. If we fail to comply with the undertakings and covenants under our loan agreements or obtain consents or waivers in respect of any breach of these undertakings and/or covenants, our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Most of our long-term loan agreements and some of our short-term loan agreements between our Chinese operating subsidiaries and the various Chinese banks and financial institutions require the prior written consent of the lenders before we may undertake specified corporate actions or transactions, such as increasing debt financing, providing new guarantees, sale or disposal of major assets, pledge of assets, amending certain corporate registration records, and engaging in certain related-party transactions. Some of our loan agreements with commercial banks in China do not include any materiality threshold under these negative covenants. While we continue to negotiate with our Chinese commercial banks with a view to modifying the form loan agreements approved by their headquarters, we have been using a practice to bridge the timing gap between our operational needs and the banks internal procedures. When our operational needs require a financing with a short completion cycle, we would typically orally communicate with our lenders before each such corporate action or transaction and, to the extent the lenders could not provide the prior written consents as requested, would proceed with the corporate action or transaction with their prior oral consents, with the mutual understanding that such lenders would provide their written confirmations of consent as soon as they complete their internal procedures. Therefore, we have in such situations technically failed to comply with the requirements that we obtain prior written consents from our lenders before we undertake certain specified corporate actions or transactions. Most of our lenders have accepted our practice, have subsequently provided their written confirmations of consent in such situations, and have waived our past covenant breaches. But non-consenting lenders have the right to accelerate their loans in accordance with their loan agreements subject to our technical default although, to date, we have not received any notice of event of default or any notice to accelerate the maturity of any such loans 12 Table of Contents from these lenders. All our long-term borrowings repayable to non-consenting banks are classified as short-term borrowings and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in obtaining consents or waivers in the future, or that our lenders will continue to accept this consent-and-waiver arrangement and grant us consents or waivers, or that our lenders will not impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us, and/or will not otherwise seek to modify the terms of our existing loan agreements in ways that are adverse to us. Although the current consent-and-waiver procedures we have employed for our technical noncompliance under the current prevailing Chinese lending environment have not had any material adverse impact on our liquidity, we cannot assure you that we will not breach any material covenants or undertakings under our loan agreements and we will additionally be able to obtain consents or waivers from our lenders for such breaches. An event of default under our loan agreements may cause acceleration of the repayment of the indebtedness under the relevant loan agreements, which may in turn require us to repay the entire principal amounts, including interest accrued, of certain other existing indebtedness prior to their maturity under cross-default provisions in our existing loan agreements. If we are required to repay a significant portion or all of our existing indebtedness prior to their maturity or if we are unable to borrow additional amounts under existing credit facilities, we may lack sufficient financial resources to make these payments or to fund our other cash requirements. Our lenders may also resort to judicial proceedings to enforce their rights. For example, we had indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of approximately Rmb 106.7 million outstanding under certain bank acceptance notes issued by a lender in Shanghai. In August 2012, the lender filed a lawsuit at a court in China with respect to amounts due under these bank acceptance notes. Under the auspices of the court, we reached a settlement with the lender. Pursuant to the court-mediated settlement agreement, we agreed to repay the lender all the outstanding principal together with interest before December 31, 2013 under an agreed schedule, although our financial difficulties have not made such repayments possible and, with subsequent renegotiations, the lender has agreed to standstill and forbear as our other creditors onshore China. As a part of the agreement, we were not construed as having committed any default or event of default under our financing arrangement with the lender. There is no assurance that we will be able to comply with the undertakings and covenants under our loan agreements or obtain consents or waivers in respect of any breach of these undertakings and/or covenants, and there could be disastrous consequences if we fail to comply, with our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects materially and adversely affected. We require a significant amount of cash to fund our capital expenditure requirements and working capital needs; if we cannot obtain additional sources of liquidity when we need it, our growth prospects and future profitability may be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2014, we had an annualized production capacity of approximately 19,200 MT of polysilicon, 4.8 GW of solar wafers, 0.3 GW of solar cells and 1.1 GW of solar modules. Due to the uncertainties in the PV market, we not only suspended all of our expansion plans for solar wafers, solar cells and solar modules, including our announced investment to add a light-emitting diode, or LED, sapphire wafer manufacturing capability to our facilities in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, and investment to add silane gas production at our Mahong Plant, we have also disposed of all of our equity interest in LDK Solar Hi-Tech (Hefei) Co., Ltd., or LDK Hefei, to third-party investors in exchange for assumption of outstanding indebtedness and an additional cash consideration. LDK Hefei was one of our manufacturing bases for solar cells and solar modules. We will, however, need substantial funding to maintain and improve our PV production capacity and additional funding for the related working capital needs, as well as our research and development, or R&D, activities as we endeavor to be competitive on cost and technology. We produce polysilicon in two plants, Xiacun Plant, located at Yushui Xiacun Industrial Park in Xinyu City, and Mahong Plant, located at Xinyu Hi-Tech Industrial Park. As of December 31, 2014, our total polysilicon annual production capacity was approximately 19,200 MT, representing contributions of approximately 1,200 MT from our Xiacun Plant and approximately 18,000 MT from our Mahong Plant. In early 2011, in order to 13 Table of Contents make our polysilicon production more efficient and to lower our production cost, we began to implement debottlenecking improvements by installing hydrochlorination facilities at both our Xiacun Plant and Mahong Plant, which would streamline our productions and further increase our aggregate annualized installed production capacity at our polysilicon plants. However, we have been significantly impacted by overcapacity and the reduced demand in the global PV market. According to PVinsights, solar-use polysilicon spot prices averaged between approximately $25 to $80 per kilogram in 2011, approximately $15 and $35 per kilogram in 2012, approximately $15 and $21 per kilogram in 2013, and approximately $19 and $24 per kilogram in 2014. As a result, we had to suspend the hydrochlorination installation process since the first quarter of 2012 and our polysilicon production since the third quarter of 2012 until January 2014 when we reconvened our hydrochlorination installation process at our Mahong Plant. Between July and December 2014, we turned on the first production line at our Mahong Plant with the existing silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4 ), or STC, hot carbon rod reactors, or STC thermal converters in order to test-run our hydrochlorination facilities after their installation. Although hydrochlorination facilities have since December 2014 become the primary converter for STC into trichlorosilane (HSiCl3 ), or TCS, and our STC thermal converters are operating as a supplemental system to support the hydrochlorination conversion, we have yet to resume the production of the second and third lines at the Mahong Plant and we need additional financing to further refine and improve our polysilicon production at Mahong Plant with the hydrochlorination facilities attached. Due to the decrease in estimated future market price for solar-grade polysilicon, the operation of the Xiacun Plant remains suspended and the uncertainty about its future service potential has caused us to constructively abandon the Xiacun Plant. If we are unable to obtain funding in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, our growth prospects and future profitability may be materially and adversely affected. Reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for the PV industry could cause demand and prices for our products to decline, thus adversely affecting our business prospects and results of operations. Growth of the PV market, particularly for on-grid applications, depends largely on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives granted by various governments. The cost of solar power now substantially exceeds the cost of conventional power provided by electric utility grids in most locations around the world. Various governments have used different policy initiatives to encourage or accelerate the development and adoption of solar power and other renewable energy sources. Renewable energy policies are in place in certain European Union member states, such as Germany and Italy, certain countries in Asia, including China, Japan and South Korea, certain states in Australia, and the United States. Examples of government-sponsored financial incentives include capital cost rebates, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and producers of PV products. These policies are intended to promote the use of solar power in both on-grid and off-grid applications and to reduce dependency on conventional forms of energy. On-grid applications refer to applications of PV products to systems that are connected to an electricity transmission grid and feed electricity generated into the electricity transmission grid, while off-grid applications refer to applications of PV products to systems that operate on a stand-alone basis to provide electricity independent of an electricity transmission grid. However, since the global financial crisis in 2008 and as a result of the global economic slowdown, many governments have found themselves unable to continue to allocate significant financial resources to support the development of the PV industry. Governments have, in differing degrees, decided to reduce or eliminate their economic incentives for political, financial or other reasons, including in response to fiscal pressures currently affecting many developed and developing nations. Reductions in, or eliminations of, government subsidies and economic incentives before the PV industry reaches a sufficient scale to be cost-effective in a non-subsidized marketplace could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations. In addition, reductions in, or eliminations of, government subsidies and economic incentives may cause the prices for the PV products of our customers to decline and we may in turn face increased pressure to 14 Table of Contents reduce the sale price of our products. To the extent any price decline cannot be offset by further reduction of our costs, our profit margin will suffer. There can be no assurance regarding the magnitude or length of time of the effects on our financial condition and results of operations caused by these developments in the global PV market or by the general global economy. Global supply of PV products may continue to exceed demand, which could cause prices for our products to remain depressed or decline, and we may develop excess production capacity and excess inventory. Prices for our PV products are based on a variety of factors, including global prices for these products, supply and demand conditions, and the terms of our customer contracts, including sales volumes. Global spot prices for PV products have fluctuated significantly over the years. With the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent global economic slowdown, we witnessed the fall and fluctuation of the solar-use polysilicon spot prices to an average between approximately $25 to $80 per kilogram in 2011, approximately $15 and $35 per kilogram in 2012, approximately $15 and $21 per kilogram in 2013, and approximately $19 and $24 per kilogram in 2014. Similarly, solar wafer prices fell to an average between approximately $0.28 to $1.02 per watt in 2011, approximately $0.21 and $0.36 per watt in 2012, approximately $0.20 and $0.25 per watt in 2013, and approximately $0.20 and $0.26 per watt in 2014. Solar module prices followed a similar pattern. Module prices fell to an average between approximately $0.75 and $1.80 per watt in 2011, approximately $0.54 and $1.40 per watt in 2012, approximately $0.54 and $1.00 per watt in 2013, and approximately $0.52 and $0.99 per watt in 2014. Before the current PV market conditions and overall global economy significantly improve, we expect there to be continued fluctuation and downward pressure on pricing along the solar power value chain in the next few years, despite the relative price stabilization in 2013 and 2014. While cost reductions across the supply chain, existing excess capacity, and industry improvements in operational efficiency and technology will drive companies in their capital expenditures, especially R&D, to maintain their competitive edge, some of the industry players may be subject to consolidation, liquidation or bankruptcy. We typically maintain a certain level of inventory of raw materials and finished or semi-finished goods based on our projected market demands. Declining prices of PV products have had a negative impact on the net realizable value of our inventories and we have had to write down the carrying value of our inventories to the extent that they are greater than their net realizable value. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we recognized inventory write-downs of $167.5 million, $70.7 million and $20.8 million, respectively, representing the amounts that the book value of our inventories exceeded their estimated net realizable values, primarily as a result of the decline in PV product selling prices. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we recognized a provision (reversal of provision) for loss on firm purchase commitments of $10.7 million, $(0.8) million and nil, respectively, which was determined by applying a methodology similar to that used to make inventory write-down. If PV product prices decline in the future and we are unable to reduce our costs in line with the price decline, our gross margins will be adversely affected and we could be required to make additional inventory write-downs and provision for loss on firm purchase commitments. Furthermore, if the actual market demands fall short of our expectations, our excess inventory will adversely affect our working capital, in addition to making inventory write-downs, and further adversely affect our profitability. We have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations, and therefore our quarterly results are not indicative of our annual results and should not be unduly relied upon. We have historically generated substantially less revenue in the first quarter of the year than the other three quarters largely due to the holiday season in China as well as the downward adjustment in feed-in tariffs and subsidies at the beginning of each year. Our customers also tend to place orders with us in the first quarter of a calendar year when their budget year begins. In 2012, approximately 23.2%, 27.3%, 33.8% and 15.7% of our annual revenue was generated in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. In 2013, approximately 17.4%, 19.2%, 26.2% and 37.2% of our annual revenues were generated in the first, second, third and fourth 15 Table of Contents quarters, respectively. In 2014, approximately 23.1%, 20.2%, 21.4% and 35.2% of our annual revenues were generated in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. Our gross profit margins also tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter largely due to fluctuations in the quarterly market prices of PV products we sell, our product mix during any quarter, and the timing differences in our ability to reduce manufacturing costs, our ability to procure low cost raw materials such as polysilicon, cells and other materials, and our ability to ramp up our in-house polysilicon and cell production. We anticipate that we will continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenues, cost of revenues and other results of operations from quarter to quarter during any year in the future. This quarterly fluctuation has adversely affected and is likely to continue to adversely affect our cash flow and working capital positions on a quarterly basis. Failure to bring our polysilicon production facilities up to full capacity within budget and on schedule or to produce polysilicon that meets our quality standards and cost objectives could adversely affect our results of operations and our business strategies. The industrial production of high-purity silicon involves highly complex technical and operational processes, and to establish and maintain these complex processes involve significant inherent risks. Currently we produce polysilicon in two plants, Xiacun Plant and Mahong Plant. As of December 31, 2014, our Xiacun Plant had an annualized installed production capacity of 1,200 MT, and our Mahong Plant had an annualized installed production capacity of 18,000 MT. With the onset of the deteriorating PV market conditions and overall global economic slowdown, we suspended our polysilicon production since the third quarter of 2012 until January 2014 when we reconvened our hydrochlorination installation process at the Mahong Plant. Between July and December 2014, we turned on the first production line at our Mahong Plant with the existing STC thermal converters in order to test-run our hydrochlorination facilities after their installation. Although hydrochlorination facilities have since December 2014 become the primary converter for STC into TCS, and our STC thermal converters are operating as a supplemental system to support the hydrochlorination conversion, we have yet to resume the production of the second and third lines at the Mahong Plant and we need additional financing to further refine and improve our polysilicon production at Mahong Plant with the hydrochlorination facilities attached. Due to the decrease in estimated future market price for solar-grade polysilicon, the operation of the Xiacun Plant remains suspended and the uncertainty about its future service potential has caused us to constructively abandon the Xiacun Plant. We produced approximately 2,520 MT, nil and 479 MT of polysilicon in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Our ability to bring our polysilicon production facilities up to full capacity and to produce polysilicon that meets our quality standards and cost objectives is contingent upon various variables and subject to various risks and uncertainties, including:  our ability to raise additional funds to finance the improvement and maintenance of the polysilicon production and related facilities on reasonable terms, or at all;  our ability to import additional equipment at reasonable cost and on a timely basis, or at all;  our ability to significantly increase our STC-TCS conversion, including the completion of our debottlenecking improvements by installing hydrochlorination facilities;  the possibility of project delays, delays in equipment deliveries and cost overruns;  our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees, including technicians and managers at different levels; and  our ability to obtain and maintain the various required Chinese government approvals. We cannot assure you that all of these contingencies and uncertainties will turn out in our favor. If we fail to re-start and ramp up our remaining polysilicon production facilities on time, fail to make our facilities operational up to their installed capacity, or fail to produce polysilicon that meets our quality standards, or if the 16 Table of Contents construction and ramp-up costs for our debottlenecking improvements significantly exceed our budget, our results of operations and our business strategies will be materially and adversely affected. Unexpected equipment failures or accidents, including any accidental release of hazardous gases or materials, may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, personal injuries, even deaths or damage to properties. Our operations, especially polysilicon production and wafer manufacturing, use complex and potentially hazardous equipment, such as chemical vapor deposition, or CVD, reactors, STC thermal converters, hydrochlorination reactors, directional solidification system, or DSS, furnaces, squares and wire saws, that requires skill and experience for safe operation. Our production of polysilicon employs volatile materials and involves chemical reactions that are sensitive to temperature and pressure, and intricate and meticulous external controls are mandatory to maintain safe operation. For example, we use TCS as a key intermediary in producing polysilicon. TCS is a type of chlorosilane gas that, when purified, is highly combustible upon contact with air, making it potentially destructive and extremely dangerous if mishandled or used in uncontrolled circumstances. We could experience events such as equipment failures, explosions, or fires due to employee errors, equipment malfunctions, accidents, electric power or cooling water supply interruptions, natural disasters, or other disruptions. A catastrophic event at one of our plants could disrupt or destroy a significant portion of our production capacity, and we will not be able to restore the disrupted or destroyed capacity for a significant period of time, if at all. In addition, such an event could damage properties or cause personal injuries or even deaths not only within our own facilities but also to the communities surrounding our plants. Our polysilicon operations also involve the use, handling, generation, processing, storage, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials that may result in fires, explosions, spills, leakage, and other unexpected or dangerous accidents causing personal injuries or death, property damage, environmental damage, and business interruptions. For instance, we experienced an accident at our Xiacun Plant in July 2010 due to non-compliant handling of certain add-on equipment by a third-party contractor during the trial run of such add-on equipment installed by the third-party contractor. This accident resulted in very serious bodily injuries to one of our employees and one employee of the third-party contractor and a temporary shut-down of the production unit with the add-on equipment. We cannot assure that accidents at our plants due to machinery malfunctions or mishandling of hazardous materials or other reasons will not occur in the future or will not result in serious damage or even human death. Any event of these types could result in civil lawsuits or regulatory enforcement proceedings and significant liabilities. We maintain property insurance at our plants, but such coverage is limited and in any event does not extend to certain significant potential losses, including those from lost production. Damage from any of such events or disruptions could also harm our reputation in the industry and among our customers and potential customers. Any such event or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Increases in electricity costs or shortage or interruption of electricity supply may adversely affect our operations. We consume a significant amount of electricity in our operations, and we need a constant supply of electricity to maintain optimal production conditions. If the necessary level of electricity supply is not maintained, we may experience significant delays and disruptions in our production. With the rapid development of the Chinese economy, demand for electricity has continued to increase. There have been electricity supply shortages in various regions across China, especially during the summer peak season and in winter when the weather is inclement. Severe weather conditions have in the past gravely curtailed the electricity supply to our plants as a result of damage to some of the national grid lines in certain Chinese provinces, including Jiangxi Province. Consequently, we experienced delays in some of our shipments to customers and some of the shipments from our suppliers as a result of highway closures and power outages in various parts of China. There have been instances where high power-consuming industrial plants, like ours, were required by the government to temporarily reduce or suspend operations to alleviate burden on the power grid. Although we have installed 17 Table of Contents backup power transformer substations on site at our production facilities, we cannot assure you that there will not be interruptions or shortages in our electricity supply or that sufficient electricity will continue to be available to us in the future as our requirements grow. Shortages in electricity supply may disrupt our normal operations and adversely affect our profitability. We historically enjoyed certain electricity usage subsidies from the local government in Xinyu City in support of our production. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we incurred electricity costs of approximately $81.8 million, $31.2 million and $48.1 million, respectively, and recorded electricity subsidies of $18.9 million, nil and nil, respectively. As a result, we recorded a net electricity cost of approximately $62.9 million, $31.2 million and $48.1 million, respectively, for the same years. In May 2010, Chinas State Council and various Chinese governmental agencies, including the National Development and Reform Commission of China, or NDRC, issued a series of notices and instructions designed to control energy consumption and environmental pollution. One of these initiatives aims to immediately terminate preferential electricity consumption policies adopted by local governments that may benefit high-energy-consuming and/or highly polluting enterprises in their jurisdictions, unless the local preferential electricity consumption policies have been duly approved by the designated Chinese central government agencies. The polysilicon industry has been included in the high-energy-consuming category under these central government notices. Our electricity subsidy arrangements were not approved by any Chinese central government agency and were terminated as of June 30, 2011. We have negotiated with the relevant local governments with respect to our electricity subsidies under these new governmental regulations and initiatives. In March 2013, the local Xinyu City government agreed to grant us certain preferential electricity rates in support of our production and we are continuing enjoying the preferential electricity rates in 2014. To date, we have not received any request from any relevant government authority to amend or terminate our electricity rate arrangement. However, we cannot assure you that we will be granted or continue to receive the same or similar benefits or in the future on the basis of the arrangement. Nor can we assure you that the local governments will not have to terminate or reduce the current rates that they have agreed to grant us as a result of these recent regulations and initiatives by the Chinese central government. As our operations are energy-intensive and are highly dependent on continuous electricity supply, our results of operations will be materially and adversely affected if our electricity supply is interrupted or if our electricity costs significantly increase upon expiration, termination or adjustment of our subsidy arrangements with the local government. Some of our long-term sales contracts with customers and some of our long-term supply contracts with equipment manufacturers and polysilicon feedstock suppliers may continue to be subject to renegotiation at terms less favorable to us, and the terms of such renegotiation may materially and adversely affect our operations and may result in costly and time-consuming litigation or other proceedings. We have entered into long-term sales arrangements with some of our major customers. Pursuant to these arrangements, we have committed to supply them with specific quantities of polysilicon, wafers and/or modules over the next few years, with some of these agreements subject to periodic negotiations of prices. We have also entered into framework agreements with other customers under which the volume and price, as well as other terms, are determined on a quarterly or annual basis or through monthly purchase orders. Some of our customers prepay a part of their procurements pursuant to their contracts with us. Similarly, we have entered into long-term supply arrangements with some of our major equipment manufacturers and principal polysilicon feedstock suppliers. We have also entered into long-term polysilicon raw material supply arrangements with our customers. Pursuant to these arrangements, we have committed to purchase specific quantities of equipment, polysilicon feedstock and other supplies over the next few years, at prices reflective of the PV market conditions prevailing at the time of the entry into these arrangements. We have also entered into framework agreements with other equipment manufacturers, polysilicon feedstock suppliers and customers under which the volume and price, as well as other terms, are determined on a quarterly or annual basis or through monthly purchase orders. Some of our suppliers require us to prepay a part of the procurements pursuant to our contracts with them. 18 Table of Contents Since the global financial crisis in 2008 and as a result of the global economic slowdown, a number of our wafer customers have sought to terminate our sales contracts or request us to delay our shipments of wafers, while we have also sought to terminate the supply contracts or to delay the shipments to us with our suppliers. These renegotiations often focused on sales or supply quantity, price and delivery timetable. At times, we had to concede to terms that were less favorable to us, including returning all or part of the prepayments our customers made to us pursuant to the contracts. Some of our customers and suppliers have gone into bankruptcy or insolvency, subject to restructuring or dissolution. Any significant deviation from the contractual terms or our inability to negotiate or renegotiate acceptable quantity, price and delivery terms from time to time with our customers or suppliers, or any bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of our major suppliers, may disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have also been involved in litigations or arbitrations arising out of these sales or supplier contract renegotiations resulting from various non-compliances with these contractual arrangements. Take Beijing Jingyuntong Technology Co., Ltd., or JYT Technology, for example. While we owned a minority equity interest in JYT Technology, this company has been a supplier of some of our DSS furnaces for solar ingot casting and some of our monocrystalline pullers. A dispute over the contractual arrangements and compliances brought both parties to arbitration proceedings in China. Although we fully paid for and took delivery of 119 DSS furnaces from JYT Technology pursuant to the equipment supply agreement, we sought to renegotiate with JYT Technology to postpone or reduce the remaining 461 DSS furnaces due to the deteriorating PV market conditions. JYT Technology, however, resisted our request and the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, in its arbitral award issued in December 2012, upheld the validity and effectiveness of the equipment supply contract and ruled that we must pay JYT Technology approximately Rmb 294 million as damages, plus an addition Rmb 3.4 million as the arbitral fees. We sold our equity interest in JYT Technology in September 2014 to settle the penalty payable to JYT Technology. These and additional dispute resolution proceedings have subjected and may continue to subject us to legal and other related costs that could be potentially expensive. These proceedings tend to distract our management from the day-to-day operations of our businesses. They also expose us to risks for which appropriate damages may not be awarded to or collectable by us. Any of these risks and factors could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. We recognized an allowance for doubtful recoveries of $92.1 million, $139.5 million and $118.9 million, respectively, for trade accounts receivable as of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, and recognized provision/(reversal of provision) for doubtful recoveries of $8.4 million, $3.2 million and $(0.3) million, respectively, for prepayments to suppliers during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Our claims for repayment of these amounts, or any other claims against our customers or suppliers to recover trade accounts receivable or prepayments would rank as unsecured claims, which would expose us to the credit risks of our customers or suppliers in the event of their insolvency or bankruptcy. Under such circumstances, our claims against the defaulting customers or suppliers would rank below those of secured creditors, which would undermine our chances of obtaining the return of our trade accounts receivable or advance payments. Accordingly, the failure of any of our new or existing customers or suppliers to meet their contractual obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of product sales generally; changes in customer purchase amounts, terms or patterns may cause significant fluctuations or declines in our revenue. Our customers are mostly solar cell and module manufacturers, solar farm developers, PV products distributors, and PV system integrators. Our largest customers as of December 31, 2014 in terms of goods and services sold (including cancellation revenue) included Solartech Energy Corporation, or Solartech, Itarion Solar, or Itarion, Oriental Sunrise New Energy Limited, or Oriental Sunrise, Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., or Hyundai, and Brics Solar Limited, or Brics Solar,. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, our top five customers collectively accounted for approximately 22.8%, 21.8% and 30.9%, respectively, of our net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2012, Sumitomo Corporation, or Sumitomo, and Photovoltech NV-SA, or Photovoltech, contributed 7.5% and 5.9%, respectively, to our net sales; for the year ended December 31, 2013, Brics Solar and Gintech Energy Corporation, or Gintech contributed 5.9% and 4.6%, respectively, to our 19 Table of Contents net sales; and for the year ended December 31, 2014, Solartech and Itarion contributed 7.3% and 6.1%, respectively, to our net sales. We expect to continue to rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that any of our customers will continue to purchase significant quantities, if any, of PV products from us. Because of our reliance on a limited number of customers, any of the following events may cause material fluctuations or declines in our net sales and profits:  reductions, delays or cancellations of purchase orders from one or more of our significant customers;  loss of one or more of our significant customers and our failure to procure additional or replacement customers; and  failure of any of our significant customers to make timely payments for our products. Our customers may decide to develop capabilities to produce the PV products they currently buy from us, and in such case, our sales to these customers would be adversely affected. If we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with our current and potential customers, or if any of our major customers encounters financial or operational difficulties or reduces its purchases of our products, it may be difficult for us to find alternative customers on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Some of our existing customers make prepayments to us, and if contracts are modified or terminated, these customers may ask for return of such prepayments. Any of these events may have an adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and cash flow. Failure to secure sufficient quantities of polysilicon feedstock on commercially reasonable terms could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition to polysilicon we produce ourselves, we source the remaining amount of solar-grade polysilicon feedstock from third parties, which is an essential raw material in manufacturing our solar wafers. We will continue to rely on third-party suppliers for some of our solar-grade polysilicon requirements until our in-house polysilicon production facilities reach their designed production capacity. Therefore, to such extent, our operations still continue to depend on our ability to procure sufficient quantities of solar-grade polysilicon on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms to supplement our in-house polysilicon production. Polysilicon is also an essential raw material for the semiconductor industry, which requires polysilicon of higher purity than that used in the solar industry. Spot prices of solar-use polysilicon have fluctuated widely over the years, with such spot prices between approximately $25 and $80 per kilogram in 2011, approximately $15 and $35 per kilogram in 2012, approximately $15 and $21 per kilogram in 2013, and approximately $19 and $24 per kilogram in 2014, each according to PVinsights. Most of our polysilicon supply agreements are subject to fluctuating market prices or price negotiations with our suppliers. In addition to price changes, suppliers may delay or default in their delivery obligations under the supply agreements. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to acquire polysilicon in sufficient quantities and on commercially reasonable terms or that we will be able to pass any increased costs of polysilicon to our customers. If we fail to do either, our business and profitability will be materially and adversely affected. Polysilicon production requires significant capital investments, and there are only a limited number of polysilicon producers in the world. These polysilicon producers provide polysilicon feedstock not only to the solar industry but also to the semiconductor industry. Historically, we have experienced delays or defaults by some of our polysilicon suppliers in delivering supplies to us. Material or prolonged delays or defaults in polysilicon supply could adversely affect our production and delivery schedule and harm our reputation. Our suppliers of raw materials and equipment, particularly virgin polysilicon suppliers, require us to make prepayments from time to time. We make these prepayments, without receiving any collateral, in order to secure a stable supply of solar-use polysilicon. As of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, our prepayments to polysilicon suppliers amounted to $15.4 million, $14.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively. Before our in-house polysilicon production facilities reach their designed production capacity, if we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with polysilicon suppliers, if any of our major suppliers fails or becomes unwilling to deliver the polysilicon we have ordered on time or at all, or if any of them encounters difficulties in its production or shipment of polysilicon feedstock to us, whether due to natural disasters, labor unrest, adverse global economic 20 Table of Contents conditions, or any other reason, it may be difficult for us to find alternative sources on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If any such defaulting supplier fails to return our prepayments, our cash flow would be adversely affected. If we are not able to manage our growth and development effectively, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We have expanded our business operations significantly over the years. Although we have adjusted our expansion plan in light of the global economic conditions from time to time, the success of our business model will depend upon, among other factors, the general economic environment for the PV industry, our ability to adjust our businesses promptly in accordance with market conditions, our R&D efforts and results, the quality and marketability of our products, our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties, the improvement of our operational and financial systems, enhancement of our internal procedures and controls, increase in our production capacity and output, and effective recruitment, training and retention of managers, technicians, engineers and skilled employees. The provisional liquidation we underwent was resultant from misjudging the industry and its prospects. We cannot assure that the current global PV market and prospects will support our existing production capacity or that our current and planned operations, personnel, systems, internal procedures and controls will be adequate to support our growth or objectives. Neither can we ensure that we will be able to expand or reduce our production capacity, nimbly or at all, in order to compete in our industry. If we are unable to manage our growth or development effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, successfully execute our business strategies, or respond to the competitive economic and industrial environment and pressures, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our customers may not prepay for their orders under agreed contractual terms, resulting in longer accounts receivable turnover cycles. We have in the past required our customers to prepay a portion of the purchase price of their orders. These prepayment arrangements with our customers have historically allowed us to rely less on borrowings to cover our working capital cash needs. Since the global financial crisis in 2008, with deteriorating PV market conditions and overall global economic slowdown, this practice has become less sustainable and, as a result, we have agreed either to reduce the contractual prepayments or to accept payments upon delivery of our goods. Advance payments from customers decreased from $175.5 million as of December 31, 2012 to $115.3 million as of December 31, 2013 and $100.6 million as of December 31, 2014. Our accounts and bills receivable decreased from $162.2 million as of December 31, 2012 to $75.3 million as of December 31, 2013 and $86.9 million as of December 31, 2014. Our expansion into PV down-stream businesses such as solar cells and modules in recent years has not only increased our working capital needs, but also extended our overall accounts receivable turnover time. Our module customers typically require longer payment terms as compared to our wafer customers. In addition, our down-stream businesses such as solar farm projects also tend to increase our inventory turnover days. As a result, our vertically integrated business model has caused, and may continue to cause, our working capital needs to significantly increase with longer accounts receivable turnover cycles and, if we fail to raise more cash on a timely basis, or at all, under such circumstances, our business operations may be materially and adversely affected. Our operations in China are subject to various governmental approvals, registrations, and reviews, and our failure to obtain necessary approvals, maintain necessary registrations, or pass necessary reviews on a timely basis, or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Business operations of our scale require approvals by, and registrations with, various Chinese governmental authorities in charge of, for example, land, buildings, urban planning, quality regulation, safety, business operations and commercial activities, customs, taxation, environmental protection, and foreign exchange administration. We are required to maintain or renew, from time to time, our existing registrations or obtain 21 Table of Contents additional approvals, which we cannot assure that we will be able to do at all times. We are required to apply for necessary approvals from the NDRC authorities in order to keep our operations and production capacities in compliance with the Chinese regulation. The Chinese government has since 2010 issued various notices proclaiming that polysilicon production capacity in China has reached excessive levels. The State Council and various Chinese government agencies, including NDRC, issued a series of notices and instructions in May 2010 in an effort to control energy consumption and environmental pollution, in which the polysilicon industry was identified in both the over-capacity and the high-energy-consuming categories. In December 2010, a number of Chinese government agencies, including NDRC, issued a circular along with the Conditions of Entry into the Polysilicon Industry, setting forth criteria and restrictions for entry into the polysilicon industry, pursuant to which any new construction of polysilicon production plant or reconstruction or expansion of existing polysilicon production plants requires approval from the relevant national investment administration authorities. Existing polysilicon projects, including ours, according to such circular, would be subject to periodic reviews by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology authorities in China. If we are not able to obtain or renew the necessary approvals on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to stop using facilities in excess of our approved capacity, otherwise subject our facilities to use restrictions, or suspend or terminate our on-going projects. Should that happen, our operations, prospects and profitability may be materially and adversely affected. We operate in a competitive market against players who may enjoy greater resources, and we may not be able to compete successfully. The PV manufacturing market is highly competitive. Many of our current and potential competitors have a longer operating history, better name recognition, greater resources, better quality and innovative expertise, larger customer base, better access to raw materials and equipment, better vertically integrated platform, better management skills and efficiencies, and greater economies of scale than we do. A number of our customers and suppliers are also our competitors. The key barriers to enter our industry at present consist of availability of financing and development of technological know-how. If these barriers disappear or become more easily surmountable, new competitors may successfully and more easily enter our industry, resulting in loss of our market share and increased price competition. We have expanded our international business operations, and our failure or inexperience in these new endeavors could adversely affect our business expansion strategies and harm our reputation. We have expanded our business operations outside China. Although we have had some international business operations ever since our inception, they were historically concentrated in international sales and procurement of raw materials. In recent years, in addition to the development of solar farm projects overseas, our international business expansion also took the form of direct acquisitions of existing businesses. Although we do not have any immediate plans to engage in additional acquisitions of the kind, we may do so when the market conditions permit, and we may meanwhile undertake various other strategic alternatives, such as strategic alliances and joint ventures with other players in the PV industry. As we engage in and expand our operations outside China, these international operations expose us to a number of related risks and uncertainties, including:  difficulty with staffing and managing overseas operations;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  increased costs associated with developing and maintaining marketing and distribution presence in various countries;  providing customer service and support in these markets;  our ability to manage multiple sales channels effectively as we expand our sales channels beyond distributors to include direct sales as well as sales to system integrators, end-users and installers; 22 Table of Contents  difficulties and costs relating to compliance with the different commercial, legal and regulatory requirements of the overseas markets in which we offer our products and services;  failure to develop appropriate risk management and internal control structures tailored for overseas operations;  inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights;  unanticipated changes in prevailing economic conditions and regulatory requirements; and  trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, that could increase the prices of our products and services and make us less competitive in some countries. Our international operations have suffered tremendously, falling far short of our objective of achieving synergistic integration and enhanced efficiencies. While Solar Power, Inc., a California company, or SPI, engaged in engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC, services for solar projects that we acquired in March 2011 continues in its operations, our majority ownership in SPI has been significantly diluted to approximately 23.5% as of the date of this annual report. Sunways AG, a German PV company that we acquired in April 2012, filed for preliminary insolvency proceedings in Germany in March 2014 and entered into formal insolvency proceedings in April 2014. In order to support Sunways operations in difficulty, we issued certain support letters, and provided various support, to Sunways prior to its insolvency proceedings. In its insolvency proceedings in Germany and during our provisional liquidation, we had to settle claims by Sunways based on such support letters partially in cash and partially with our convertible securities. We have learned our lesson the hard way. In order to make acquisitions and strategic alternatives synergistic and favorable to our overall business operations, integration and pro-active global management will be crucial to our success as a vertically integrated global PV player. As a significant portion of our operations will continue to be located in China, unless we are able to effectively manage the global integration and other risks relating to international operations, these acquisitions could instead impair our ability to expand our business in China and abroad. Accordingly, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and our business operations and vertical integrations may be materially hampered. We compete with alternative solar and other renewable energy technologies, and we may not be able to compete successfully. We have been focused on crystalline silicon solar technologies, and compete with alternative solar technologies. The PV industry is characterized by evolving technologies and standards. These technological evolutions and developments place increasing demands on the improvement of our products such as higher PV efficiency and larger and thinner wafers. Some companies have spent significant resources in R&D of proprietary solar technologies that may eventually produce PV products at costs similar to, or lower than, those of crystalline silicon PV products without compromising product quality. For example, some companies are developing or currently producing PV products based on thin-film PV materials, which require significantly less polysilicon to produce than our crystalline silicon PV products. These alternative PV products may cost less than those based on crystalline technologies while achieving a competitive level of conversion efficiency. The solar technologies in general also compete with other renewable energy technologies, such as biomass, hydroelectric, wind, and geothermal technologies, as well as nuclear power technologies, in addition to conventional power generation, for, among other things, government subsidies, market share, and public acceptance and support. If prices for conventional and other renewable energy sources decline, or if these sources enjoy greater policy support than solar power, the solar power industry could suffer and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. We also compete with alternative polysilicon technology, and we may not be able to compete successfully. Although the vast majority of polysilicon produced in the world utilizes the CVD process, or the modified Siemens process, which consumes a large amount of electricity, several alternative crystalline silicon-based 23 Table of Contents production processes have been developed that may significantly reduce power consumption and other production costs. For example, some of our competitors currently use, or are constructing facilities that use, the fluidized bed reactor, or FBR, method for producing polysilicon. Some have developed a polysilicon technology called the vapor-to-liquid deposition process. Others are developing the ability to produce upgraded metallurgical grade silicon as a low-cost alternative to solar-grade polysilicon produced through modified Siemens process. Further developments in competing polysilicon production technologies may result in lower manufacturing costs or higher product performance than those achieved from the Siemens processes, including the modified Siemens process that we currently employ. As a result, we may need to invest significant resources in R&D to maintain our market position, keep pace with technological advances in the PV industry and effectively compete in the future. Our failure to further refine and enhance our products or to keep pace with evolving technologies and industry standards could cause our products and production facilities to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which could in turn reduce our market share and cause our net sales and profits to decline. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for our production equipment and consumables, and failure or delay by any of them in delivering equipment or consumables to us could adversely affect our production. We rely on a limited number of equipment suppliers in and outside China for all of our principal manufacturing equipment and spare parts, including our CVD reactors, STC thermal converters, hydrochlorination reactors, multicrystalline DSS furnaces, monocrystalline pullers, squarers that we use to cut ingots into smaller blocks, wafering wire saws that we use to slice these blocks into wafers, our solar cell manufacturing equipment, and solar module manufacturing equipment. In addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for the consumables, such as crucibles and slurry, that we use in our wafer production. These suppliers have provided most of our current equipment and spare parts, and we will also rely on them for a substantial portion of the principal manufacturing equipment and spare parts for our future development. If we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these and other equipment or consumables suppliers, or should any of our major equipment or consumables suppliers encounter difficulties in the manufacturing or shipment of its equipment or consumables to us, including financial difficulties or natural disasters, or otherwise fail to supply equipment or consumables according to our requirements, it will be difficult for us to find alternative providers for the equipment or consumables we need on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We also rely on our suppliers for the routine maintenance, check-up, and repair with respect to some of our equipment. In the event that our equipment malfunctions or fails to function due to lack of support, or our equipment or crucibles lead to defective or substandard products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we are unable to fulfill our customer orders or other commitments to customers on a timely basis, we may lose customers, our reputation may be damaged, and we may incur economic losses for breach of contracts. We have from time to time experienced delays in fulfilling purchase orders from some of our customers due to fluctuations in our production output as we ramp up our production capacity, fluctuations in general market demand for our products due to the global or regional economic conditions, disruptions to our delivery of products due to extraordinary weather conditions, and various other factors. We often enter into contractual commitments with our customers in connection with our sales. Our ability to meet our contractual commitments to our customers depends significantly on the successful and timely implementation of our production schedule. We have been subject to various claims, replacement requirements and even legal proceedings in our solar farm projects and EPC services, mostly for defective modules we sourced in such projects and services. If we are unable to fulfill our customer orders or other commitments to customers on a timely basis, we may lose our customers and our reputation may be damaged. Moreover, our contracts with our customers sometimes provide for specified monetary damages or penalties for non-delivery or failure to meet delivery schedules or product specifications. If any of our customers invokes these clauses against us, we may need to defend ourselves against the relevant claims, which could be time-consuming and expensive. We may be found liable under these clauses and be required to pay damages, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 24 Table of Contents Product defects could result in increased costs, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues and market share. Our products may contain defects that originate in our less-than-perfect production process or that are not detected until they have been shipped, installed or otherwise incorporated into PV products of our customers. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, we recorded inventory write-downs of $13.4 million, nil and nil, respectively, related to defects identified in our products. In the ordinary course of our business, we also encounter periodic sales returns due to non-conformity with customers specifications or product defects. In most of the cases, we are required to replace our products promptly. Some of our customers have, however, escalated their claims to legal or arbitration proceedings often due to the delay or ineffectiveness in our responses across different jurisdictions. Product defects and the possibility of product defects could cause significant damage to our market reputation and reduce our product sales and market share. If we cannot successfully maintain consistency and quality throughout our production process, this will result in substandard quality or performance of our products. If we deliver products with defects, or if there is a perception that our products are of substandard quality, we may incur substantially increased costs associated with replacements of products, our credibility and market reputation will be harmed, and sales of our PV products may be adversely affected. We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, international trade sanctions, or claims or allegations in press articles or market reports, which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and reputation, and may cause loss of business. We and/or our directors and officers have been, and in the future may continue to be, involved in allegations, litigation or legal or administrative proceedings, including those related to alleged violations of securities laws. Litigation in general can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Regardless of the merits, responding to these matters and defending against litigation can be time consuming and costly, and may result in us incurring substantial legal and administrative expenses, as well as divert the attention of our management. Any such allegations, lawsuits or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. Further, unfavorable outcomes from these claims or lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In October and November 2011, upon the petition of SolarWorld Industries America, a U.S.-based manufacturer of PV products, the U.S. International Trade Commission, or the ITC, and the U.S. Department of Commerce, or the DOC, respectively, commenced anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations on crystalline silicon PV cells, whether or not assembled into modules, imported from China. The DOC and the ITC made affirmative final determinations in the investigations, and the DOC published anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders in December 2012. Our products from China within the scope of these orders are currently subject to an anti-dumping duty deposit rate of 13.94% and a countervailing duty deposit rate of 15.24%. Appeals of these determinations are currently pending at the U.S. Court of International Trade. The rates at which duties will be assessed and payable are subject to ongoing administrative reviews that are expected to conclude in July 2015 and may differ from the announced deposit rates. In December 2013, SolarWorld Industries America filed its second petition regarding imports of other crystalline silicon PV products from China and Taiwan. In January 2014, the DOC and the ITC commenced anti-dumping duty investigations of imports of these products from China and Taiwan and a countervailing duty investigation of imports of these products from China. The DOC and the ITC made affirmative final determinations in the investigations, and the DOC published anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders in February 2015. Our products from China within the scope of these second orders are currently subject to an anti-dumping duty deposit rate of 30.06% and a countervailing duty deposit rate of 38.43%. Appeals of these determinations are currently pending at the U.S. Court of International Trade. The rates at which duties will be assessed and payable are subject to administrative reviews that are expected to commence in February 2016 and may differ from the announced deposit rates. In September and November 2012, respectively, the European Union, or the EU, initiated an anti-dumping investigation and an anti-subsidy investigation concerning crystalline silicon PV modules and key components 25 Table of Contents (i.e., cells and wafers) originating in China. We were selected by the European Commission, or the EC, as a sampled company in the investigations. In December 2013, the EU published anti-dumping and countervailing measures on crystalline silicon PV modules and cells originating in or consigned from China. EU imports of our cells and modules became subject to a combined anti-dumping and countervailing duty of 58.2%. However, under the terms of an undertaking entered into with the EC by various Chinese PV companies, including us, this combined duty is not payable so long as certain conditions, including a minimum import price and a volume ceiling, are met and until the measures expire or the EC withdraws the undertaking. In addition to the PV products that we have sold directly to the U.S. and EU markets, we have also supplied polysilicon and other components to other China-based PV product manufacturers who export their PV products to the U.S. and EU markets. In addition to affecting our direct sales, any anti-dumping and/or countervailing duty imposed by the U.S. and/or EU authorities may indirectly affect us through its impact on such China-based PV product manufacturers, and may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As we have significantly relied on international customers for our products since our inception, any similar or other trade-related investigations and proceedings as well as any similar or other resultant anti-dumping and/or countervailing duty imposed by jurisdictions where we have directly or indirectly sold significant quantities of our PV products may result in a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our business depends on the continued services of our executive officers, key personnel and a skilled labor force, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services. Our continued operations depend, to a significant extent, on the continued services of our executive officers and key personnel and our ability to attract, train and retain technicians and a skilled labor force for our business. Xiaofeng Peng, our founder and former chairman, has resigned from all of our directorship and management positions in 2014, although we have retained Mr. Peng as a senior consultant and, in recognition of his many contributions to our company since its founding, we have also named Mr. Peng the Chairman Emeritus for our company. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our executive officers and key personnel. If one or more of our executive officers and key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. As a result, our business may be materially disrupted and we may have to incur additional expenses in order to recruit and retain new personnel. In addition, if any of our executives joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some of our customers. Each of our executive officers and key personnel has entered into an employment agreement with us that contains confidentiality and non-competition provisions. However, if any dispute arises between our executive officers or key personnel and us, we cannot assure you, in light of uncertainties associated with the Chinese legal system, that these agreements could be enforced in China where most of our executive officers and key personnel reside and hold most of their assets. Recruiting and retaining capable technicians, particularly those with expertise in the PV industry, are vital to our success. Our principal operations are located at Xinyu City of Jiangxi Province, a relatively less developed region compared to coastal cities in China. Our location adds difficulties to our recruiting efforts. In addition, there exists substantial competition for qualified technicians in the PV industry, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain technicians. Neither can we assure you that we will be able to recruit, train and retain skilled workers. We face additional difficulties in staffing our overseas operations and any new business operations that we may enter into. If we fail to attract and retain qualified employees, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. The interests of our substantial shareholders may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders. Prior to April 1, 2015, we had three substantial shareholders, without taking into account any securities that any shareholder has the right to acquire within 60 days after the date of this annual report through the exercise of any option, warrant or right, especially the convertible securities we have issued in the provisional liquidation. 26 Table of Contents As of April 30, 2015, Mr. Peng, our founder and former chairman, currently beneficially owned, through LDK New Energy Holding Limited, his wholly owned British Virgin Islands company, or LDK New Energy, 48,053,953 of our shares, representing approximately 18.4% of our outstanding share capital. Mr. Kin-Ming Cheng currently beneficially owns, through Fulai Investments Limited, his wholly owned British Virgin Islands company, or Fulai Investments, 42,000,000 of our shares, representing approximately 16.1% of our outstanding share capital. Heng Rui Xin Energy (HK) Co., Limited, or HRX, a Hong Kong company invested by privately owned and Chinese state-owned funds, owns 25,307,497 of our shares, representing approximately 9.7% of our outstanding share capital. HRX has also provided funding facilities to us for our provisional liquidation and for our working capital requirements, which may entitle HRX to additional securities convertible into our shares. Due to the issuance by us of convertible securities as a consequence of our offshore restructuring and especially the availability of using VWAP to calculate their conversion price, if we take into account equity securities that any holder has the right to acquire within 60 days after the date of this annual report through the exercise of any option, warrant or right, our shareholding structure is already changing and could be significantly different going forward given the relatively low trading prices of our ADSs at present. You should carefully follow and review the various statements on Schedules 13D and 13G filed by persons with the SEC to report their acquisitions of our equity interests from time to time. We are subject to a present, constant and significant risk of a change of control from time to time. Any significant holder of our convertible securities, whether due to its previous substantial position in our 2014 senior notes or in our LDK Silicon preferred shares, could decide to change the control in our company through its conversion into our equity securities. Although our convertible securities issued in our offshore restructuring contain some restrictions on the amount of conversions on an annual and quarterly basis, such restrictions will all disappear by April 1, 2016. Under such circumstances, each of the significant or potentially significant shareholders may have substantial control over our business, including decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors, dividend policy and other significant corporate actions. They may take actions that are not in the best interest of our company or our other shareholders and securities holders. We may be adversely affected by volatility in the solar energy market and industry, which is at an early stage of development and is subject to many factors which are beyond our control, and therefore our revenues may be volatile. We are affected by solar energy market and industry trends as well as macro-economic factors. The PV market in general is at an early stage of development and the extent of acceptance of PV technology and products is uncertain. Market data on the PV industry are not as readily available as that on other more established industries where trends can be assessed more reliably from data gathered over a longer period of time. As a result, the average selling price and the market demand for PV products are highly volatile and subject to many factors which are beyond our control, including:  the extent of commercial adoption and application of PV technology;  cost-effectiveness, performance and reliability of PV technology and products compared to conventional and other renewable energy sources and products;  availability of government subsidies and economic incentives to support the development of the PV industry;  success of, or increased government support for, other alternative energy generation technologies, such as fuel cells, wind power, hydroelectric power and biomass energy;  success of solar technologies other than crystalline silicon;  fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the financing and viability of renewable energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil and other fossil fuels; 27 Table of Contents  deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry; and  levels of capital expenditures by end-users of PV products, which tend to decrease when economic growth slows. If the average selling price or demand for PV products decrease dramatically, we may not be able to grow our business or generate sufficient revenues to sustain our profitability. For example, partially due to the global financial crisis in 2008 and the deteriorating PV market conditions coupled with the overall global economic slowdown, we incurred a net loss of $1,052.1 million, $1,637.2 million and $269.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. In addition, the prices of PV products have declined since 2010 due primarily to lower prices of polysilicon and increased manufacturing capacity for PV products. Any negative market and industry trends could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will not generate net losses or no greater amounts of net losses going forward due to numerous factors beyond our control, including the external global economic environment, the well-being of the PV industry, and our internal productivity and other operational conditions. Our strategy includes alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions and dispositions of assets, and restructuring of our business operations; our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business. As part of our strategy and subject to market conditions, we may enter into strategic acquisitions and investments and establish strategic alliances with third parties in the PV industry if suitable opportunities arise. We may acquire or invest in technologies, businesses or assets that are strategically important to our business operations or that we believe will complement our business strategies, such as investments in new technologies. We may also make strategic dispositions of our assets or restructure our business operations, as we have been doing in recent years to raise financing, cut losses or otherwise. Any strategic acquisition, investment and alliance with third parties could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with the assimilation of new different operations, technologies and personnel, any unforeseen or hidden liabilities, the inability to generate sufficient revenue and income to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions, the potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, customers and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses, and a reduction or loss of control of operations that are material to our business. Moreover, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances may divert our cash flow from servicing our debts and making necessary capital expenditures and subject us to impairment losses on our acquisitions and investments in equity securities and risks of non-performance by counterparties, which may in turn lead to monetary losses that may materially and adversely affect our business. An acquisition could also expose us to different and unfamiliar legal regimes, regulatory requirements and market conditions, related litigation and other proceedings, unknown liabilities and other unforeseen risks. Difficulties encountered with respect to the acquisitions, investments, or alliances or in the process of integration could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our overall business. Any failure to integrate any acquired businesses or joint ventures into our operations successfully and any material liabilities or potential liabilities of any acquired businesses or joint ventures that are not identified by us during our due diligence process for such acquisitions or investments could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are subject to the management report and auditor attestation report requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a public company, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, require that we evaluate the effectiveness, as of the end of each fiscal year, of our internal control over financial reporting and include in our annual report on Form 20-F for each fiscal year (i) a report of our management on our internal control over financial reporting that contains, among other things, managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the most recent 28 Table of Contents fiscal year, including a statement on whether or not internal control over financial reporting is effective and (ii) the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm, either unqualified or adverse, as to whether we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of such fiscal year. Such management report and auditor opinion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 are contained in Item 15. Controls and Procedures  Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and  Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in this annual report. Our management and auditors are not permitted to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective if there are one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules of the SEC and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our management has identified two material weaknesses, as disclosed in the management annual report referenced above. We cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to be effective or that any additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Moreover, if we continue to fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting for as long as our failure. Sustained failure or non-compliance in our internal control over financial reporting will have a material adverse impact on the disclosures we make to the investing public and result in serious damage to our reputation and credibility. Even if we do conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may still issue a report that is qualified or adverse if it is not satisfied with our internal control. Furthermore, effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important to help us to manage the company effectively and prevent fraud. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and have used, and will continue to use, significant management and other resources in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our independent registered public accounting firms audit documentation related to their audit report included in this annual report may be located in China. The PCAOB currently cannot inspect audit documentation located in China and, as such, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued the audit report included in this annual report. As auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our audit firm is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the applicable laws of the United States and professional standards. Our operations, however, are principally conducted in China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections or review audit documentation without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Accordingly, any audit documentation located in China related to our audit firms report included in our filings with the SEC is not currently inspected by the PCAOB. Inspections conducted by the PCAOB outside China have identified deficiencies in those firms audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability to conduct inspections in China, however, prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating audit documentation located in China and its related quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firms audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to audits outside China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. Investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements. 29 Table of Contents Our independent registered public accounting firm may be temporarily suspended from practicing before the SEC, if it is unable to continue to satisfy SEC investigation requests in the future, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act. In late 2012, the SEC commenced administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and also under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act against the Chinese affiliates of five global accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm. The Rule 102(e) proceedings initiated by the SEC relate to these firms failure to produce documents, including audit work papers, at the request of the SEC pursuant to Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the auditors located in China are not in a position lawfully to produce documents directly to the SEC because of restrictions under the Chinese law and specific directives issued by the CSRC. Substantially all of our operations are inside China. Certain of our audit firms audit documentation related to its audit reports included in this annual report are located in China, and certain audit procedures are taken place within Chinas borders. As we have disclosed previously in this annual report, the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections in China or review audit documentation located within China without the approval of Chinese authorities. In January 2014, an SEC administrative law judge issued an initial decision to censure these accounting firms and suspend the Chinese member firms of four of the five firms, including our audit firm, from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. In February 2014, these China-based accounting firms appealed to the SEC against this decision. In February 2015, the four China-based accounting firms reached a settlement with the SEC over the dispute in relation to access to such accounting firms audit documents. As part of the settlement, each of the Chinese member firms of Big Four accounting firms agreed to settlement terms that include a censure, undertakings to make a payment to the SEC, procedures and undertakings as to future requests for documents by the SEC and possible additional proceedings and remedies should those undertakings not be adhered to. Although the ability of these firms to continue to service all their respective clients is not affected by the settlement, the settlement requires the firms to follow detailed procedures to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms audit documents via the CSRC. If the firms do not follow these procedures, the SEC could impose penalties such as suspensions, or it could restart the administrative proceedings. Our independent registered public accounting firm currently relies on its Chinese member firm for assistance in completing the audit work associated with our operations in China. If the settlement terms are not adhered to, Chinese member firms of the four accounting firms may be suspended from practicing before the SEC, which could result in our financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act. If our independent registered public accounting firm is denied temporarily or permanently the ability to practice before the SEC and we are unable to find another registered public accounting firm on a timely basis to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act. Moreover, a delinquency in our filings with the SEC could adversely harm our reputation and have other material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. The financial disclosure in interactive data we are required to provide on SECs electronic filing system and our own website involve special and technical processing and processes, and may expose us to unintended additional risks and liabilities. We provide financial disclosure in interactive data format on SECs electronic filing system and post them on our corporate website in connection with our annual report on Form 20-F as required by the SEC rules and regulations. In compliance with such requirements, we use the eXtensible Business Reporting Language, or XBRL, and the taxonomy or standard list of tags in XBRL format developed for financial reporting in interactive format consistent with U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and regulations. The XBRL list of tags contains descriptive labels, definitions, authoritative references to U.S. GAAP and the SEC rules and regulations where applicable, 30 Table of Contents and other elements, all of which aim to provide the contextual information necessary for interactive data to be recognized and processed by software. As required by the SEC rules and regulations, we are required to post our interactive data for at least 12 months on our corporate website on the same day we file our annual report on Form 20-F. When we apply XBRL taxonomy or data tags to our consolidated financial statements and the notes and schedules, we are initially guided by the software in tagging information contained in our financial statements with the appropriate tags in the standard list. Each element in the standard list of tags has a standard label. We typically match the standard labels to each caption in our consolidated financial statements and notes and schedules. To the extent we have flexibility in how to report our financial information under U.S. GAAP in our consolidated financial statements and notes and schedules, we may decide to use a non-standard financial statement line item that is not included in the standard list of tags. In this situation, we will create a company-specific element, called an extension. Similarly, when we identify a difference between some elements associated with the standard label and those associated with our financial reporting item, we may change, or extend, the standard label when we tag such financial disclosure. Due to the complexity and technicality in tagging our consolidated financial statements and the notes and schedules, we have outsourced the tagging process to a third party specialist, with the data tagging subject to our review and approval. As financial statements in interactive data format are intended to be processed by software applications, the unprocessed data are not readable by humans. You will need viewers to convert or render the interactive data file to human readable format. Some viewers are similar to Web browsers used to read HTML files. You will also need software to process interactive data so as to automate and facilitate access to and analysis of the tagged data. We cannot assure you of the availability of any applications in existence or under development that may provide the functionality that you require for your purposes. XBRL is an open standard that defines or tags data using standard definitions. These tags are supposed to establish a consistent structure of identity and context, capable of being recognized and processed by a variety of different software applications. We understand that XBRL was developed and is currently supported by XBRL International, and that software applications, such as databases, financial reporting systems, and spreadsheets, recognize and process tagged financial information. You should also note that the XBRL standard will not remain static and is subject to updating, and the list of newer tags may differ significantly from the old or existing list. Such new developments will not only affect our tagging process going forward, but also your use of our tagged financial disclosure. We are subject to liabilities under the federal securities laws with respect to our interactive data files submitted to, or filed with, the SEC. The interactive data files in this annual report will entail the same liability as our regular filings under the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and/or the Securities Exchange Act. In addition, if we fail to provide the required financial disclosure in interactive data format on SECs electronic filing system or post such interactive data our own corporate website each on the date so required, we will not be regarded as current with our reports under the Securities Exchange Act and, as a result, will not be eligible to use the short registration statement forms, such as Form F-3, and will not be deemed to have available adequate current public information for purposes of the resale exemption safe harbor provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business. As of December 31, 2014, our sales were primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, Renminbi and pound sterling. Our costs and capital expenditures are largely denominated in Renminbi. Therefore, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly among the U.S. dollar, Renminbi and pound sterling, affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. The functional currency of our principal operating subsidiaries, which are located in China, is the Renminbi. To the extent these subsidiaries hold assets denominated in U.S. dollars or any other foreign currency, any 31 Table of Contents appreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and/or such foreign currency could result in a charge to our statements of operations and a reduction in the value of their U.S. dollar-denominated and/or foreign currency-denominated assets. Similarly, a depreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar or any foreign currency could reduce the U.S. dollar or foreign currency equivalent amounts of our financial results. We incurred a net foreign currency exchange loss of $6.4 million, $20.7 million and $3.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur additional net foreign currency losses in the future. During 2011, we entered into certain foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the effect of our foreign exchange exposure up to 2014, and have not entered into any other or additional foreign exchange forward contracts. However, we cannot assure you that these types of hedging activities or our omission of hedging activities will be effective in managing our foreign exchange risk exposure. Compliance with environmental and safety regulations is expensive, and noncompliance may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspension of our business operations. The majority of our business operations are located in China, and we are required to comply with all Chinese national and local regulations regarding the protection of the environment and the safety of operations. Our overseas subsidiaries are required to comply with national, federal and local regulations regarding the environmental protection and operational safety for their businesses in their respective jurisdictions. Compliance with environmental and safety regulation is expensive. The Chinese government is adopting more stringent environmental protection and operational safety regulations and the costs of complying with these regulations are expected to increase. See Item 4. Information on the Company  B. Business Overview  Regulatory Framework  Environmental Regulations and  Production Safety and Environment for more detailed information. Although we have obtained all of the necessary approvals and permits for our production facilities currently existing or under construction, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all applicable environmental protection and operational safety requirements, and obtain all of the required governmental approvals and permits that may be or may become applicable to us on a timely basis, or at all, or will be able to complete all our registrations and filings with the government, in time for all of our projects currently under construction or our future projects. The relevant governmental authorities may impose on us fines for any non-compliance, set deadlines for rectification, and order us to cease construction or production if we fail to comply with their requirements. For each of our PV production facilities in China, we are required to conduct an environmental impact assessment, obtain approval of the assessment before commencing construction and complete an examination and obtain an environmental acceptance approval before we begin production. We must also periodically renew the various environmental acceptance approvals that we have obtained to be able to continue our business operations. Our polysilicon production facilities, in particular, use, generate, store, dispose of, and discharge toxic, volatile and otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes. We are therefore subject to licensing requirements, regulations and periodic monitoring by local environmental protection authorities regarding the use, storage, transportation and disposal of such hazardous chemicals and the disposal of other wastes we generate. Discharge of waste water from our production facilities is an example, for which we must file reports with and obtain discharge permits from the relevant Chinese government authorities. We are also subject to the periodic production safety examinations and reviews in order to obtain or renew our operational safety permits. As we disclosed in the risk factor entitled  Unexpected equipment failures or accidents, including any accidental release of hazardous gases or materials, may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, personal injuries, even deaths or damage to properties, our operations, especially wafer manufacturing and polysilicon production, use complex and potentially hazardous equipment, such as CVD reactors, STC thermal converters, and hydrochlorination reactors, DSS furnaces, squarers and wire saws, that requires skill and experience for safe operation. We also use and discharge toxic, volatile and otherwise hazardous chemicals in our polysilicon production processes, for which we must register with the relevant 32 Table of Contents authorities and obtain the relevant safety permits before we may use such hazardous chemicals in our production processes, including a permit for the storage and use of hazardous chemicals and a permit for the use of atmospheric pressure containers. Although we have obtained all the necessary operational safety permits for our current operations, we will not be able to renew such operational safety permits, or obtain them for projects under construction, if we fail to comply with present or future safety regulations in China. Our failure may subject us to substantial fines or damages or the suspension of our production operations, which may harm our reputation and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims or business interruptions. We are exposed to risks associated with product liability claims in the event that the use of our PV products results in injury. Due to our limited historical experience, we are unable to predict whether product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or to predict the effect of any resulting adverse publicity on our business. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages and require us to make significant payments. Moreover, we only carry limited product liability insurance coverage and may not have adequate resources to satisfy a judgment in the event of a successful claim against us. We do not carry any business interruption insurance. Based on the insurance products available in China, even if we decide to take out business interruption coverage, such insurance as currently available offers limited coverage compared to that offered in many other jurisdictions. Any business disruption, industrial accident or natural disaster could result in substantial losses and diversion of our resources. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, know-how and technology may undermine our competitive position. We have developed various production process-related know-how and technologies in the production of polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules. Know-how and technologies of this type play a critical role in our quality control and cost reduction. In addition, we have on-going R&D programs with a view to continually developing techniques and processes that will improve our production efficiency and product quality. Our intellectual property and proprietary rights arising out of these R&D programs will be crucial in maintaining our competitive edge in the PV industry. We currently have 121 issued patents, and 104 patent applications pending globally. In addition, we also have two registered copyrights and three registered trademarks in China. We rely primarily on patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright law and contractual arrangements with employees to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Nevertheless, these afford only limited protection, and the actions that we may take to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequate. Our failure to protect our production process related know-how and technologies and/or our intellectual property and proprietary rights may undermine our competitive position. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property and proprietary rights. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Also, litigation, which can be costly and divert management attention and other resources away from our business, may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. We cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor or that we will be able to effectively enforce any remedies available to us. An adverse determination in any such litigation or failure to enforce our remedies will impair our intellectual property and proprietary rights and may harm our business, prospects and reputation. We may be exposed to intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other claims by third parties and an adverse determination could result in us paying significant damages. Our success depends on our ability to use and develop our technology and know-how, to produce our polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules and to sell our polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules without infringing the intellectual property or other rights of third parties. We may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, 33 Table of Contents in June 2008, an objection was filed against Jiangxi LDK Solar regarding its trademark LDK. The initial decision of the applicable trademark authority on this objection was granted in our favor in November 2010 and the final judgment was granted in our favor in May 2012. The validity and scope of claims relating to PV technology patents involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analyses and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, patent opposition proceedings, trademark disputes and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert our resources and the attention of our technical and management personnel. An adverse ruling in any such litigation or proceedings could subject us to significant liability to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, to pay ongoing royalties, or to redesign our products, or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the production and sale of our products or the use of our technologies. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such dispute. We have granted, and may continue to grant, stock options under our stock incentive plans and our net income could be adversely affected. We adopted a stock incentive plan in 2006 and another in 2013. As of the date of this annual report, we have outstanding stock options under these plans with respect to 7,870,437 shares, all of which were granted to our directors and employees at the time of the grant. During the past few years, as a result of the significant decreases in our share prices, we and some of our optionees agreed to cancel some of the previously granted, but not yet vested, stock options and to replace them with newly granted options with similar terms at lower exercise prices. According to Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 718, Share-Based Payment, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, we are required to recognize share-based compensation as compensation expense in the statement of operations based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of the grant, with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, our non-cash share-based compensation expenses amounted to $8.9 million, $7.5 million and $8.6 million, respectively, with respect to share options granted to our employees. The additional expenses associated with share-based compensation may reduce the attractiveness of issuing stock options under our stock incentive plans. However, if we do not grant stock options or we reduce the number of stock options that we grant, we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor force. If we grant more stock options to attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor force, the expenses associated with share-based compensation may adversely affect our net income. Most of our production, storage, administrative and R&D facilities are located in close proximity to one another in Xinyu City of Jiangxi Province; and any damage or disruption at these facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Most of our production, storage, administrative and R&D facilities are located in close proximity to one another in Xinyu City of Jiangxi Province in China. A natural disaster, such as fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, severe snow storms or other unanticipated catastrophic events, including power interruptions, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, explosions, fires, break-ins, terrorist acts or war, could significantly disrupt our production and business operations. If any of our production facilities or material equipment were to experience any significant damage or downtime, or if any of our storage, administrative and R&D facilities were to suffer any material damage or disruption, we may be unable to meet our production targets and our business would be adversely affected. Moreover, as we have disclosed in the risk factor entitled  We have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims or business interruptions, we do not carry any business interruption insurance. Even if we decide to take out business interruption coverage, such insurance available in China offers limited coverage, which may be insufficient to cover the damage or disruption at these facilities. Any such business disruption or natural disaster could result in substantial losses and diversion of our resources, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 34 Table of Contents Dividends, if any, and the interest and principal payments on intercompany loans or advances paid by our subsidiaries constitute an important source for us to fund our cash and financing requirements, and any limitation on the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay intercompany loans or advances to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. LDK Solar is a holding company with no material operations. We conduct our operations mainly through our Chinese subsidiaries. In addition to financings conducted by LDK Solar, dividends, if any, and the interest and principal payments on intercompany loans or advances from our subsidiaries constitute an important source for LDK Solar, as a holding company, to satisfy its obligations and to pay any dividends LDK Solar may declare. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make payments on intercompany loans or advances to their shareholders is subject to, among other things, distributable earnings, reserve funds, cash flow conditions, restrictions contained in the articles of association of our subsidiaries, applicable laws and regulations, and restrictions contained in the debt instruments or agreements of such subsidiaries. In addition, if any of our subsidiaries raises capital by issuing equity securities to third parties, the dividends declared and paid with respect to such equity securities would not be available to LDK Solar. We incurred a significant amount of indebtedness onshore China and an overwhelming portion of such onshore indebtedness remain unserviced subject to a standstill and forbearance arrangement with our Chinese lenders. It is unforeseeable that our Chinese operating subsidiaries will be able to upstream any net profit for our declaration and distribution of dividends at any time at all. In addition, Chinese laws and regulations permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations, and such profits differ from profits determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP in certain significant respects, including the use of different bases of recognition of revenue and expenses. Our Chinese subsidiaries are also required to set aside a portion of their after-tax profits according to Chinese accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserves that are not distributable as cash dividends. In practice, our Chinese subsidiaries are also required to obtain a required tax clearance with the local tax bureau and complete the corresponding foreign exchange procedures before paying any dividends. In addition, under the Chinese Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementing regulations, Chinese income tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable by Chinese enterprises to non-resident enterprises (enterprises that do not have an establishment or place of business in China or that have such an establishment or place of business in China but for which the relevant dividend income is not effectively connected with such establishment or place of business), subject to any exemption or lower withholding tax rate as may be contained in any income tax treaty or agreement between China and the jurisdictions of incorporation of such non-resident enterprises. According to the Arrangement between Mainland China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, subject to the confirmation of the in-charge local tax authority, dividends paid by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its direct holding company in Hong Kong will be subject to the withholding tax at a rate of no more than 5%, if the direct holding company in Hong Kong is the beneficial owner and owns directly at least 25% the equity interest of the foreign-invested enterprise. The Chinese State Administration of Taxation subsequently provided guidance for determining whether a resident of a contracting jurisdiction is the beneficial owner of an item of income under Chinas tax treaties and tax arrangements. According to the interpretation of the Chinese State Administration of Taxation, a beneficial owner generally must be engaged in substantive business activities. An agent or conduit company will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and, therefore, will not qualify for such treaty benefits. A conduit company normally refers to a company set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits. Thus, dividends payable to us by our subsidiaries in China, if any, will be subject to a 10% income tax if we are considered a non-resident enterprise under the EIT Law. Although some of our Chinese operations are held through Hong Kong entities, such as LDK Solar International Company Limited and LDK Silicon Hong Kong, we are uncertain as to whether and the extent to which these Hong Kong companies meet the beneficial ownership requirements and are eligible for the benefits under this Hong Kong-mainland China double taxation avoidance arrangement when they receive dividends from their subsidiaries in China. We cannot assure you how long it will take to apply for such benefits 35 Table of Contents and, if and when we apply, whether we will be successful in our applications. Neither can we assure you that we will have sufficient cash flow from dividends or repayments on intercompany loans or advances from our Chinese subsidiaries to pay any dividend we may declare. Furthermore, although we currently do not have any offshore shareholder loans to our Chinese subsidiaries that are foreign invested companies, we may resort to such offshore lending in the future, rather than equity contribution, to our Chinese subsidiaries to finance their operations. In such events, the market interest rates that our Chinese subsidiaries can pay with respect to offshore loans generally may not exceed comparable interest rates in the international finance markets. Under the EIT Law, our Chinese subsidiaries are also required to pay a 10% (or 7% if the interest is paid to a Hong Kong resident under certain circumstances) withholding tax on our behalf on the interest paid under any shareholder loan. Prior to payment of interest and principal on any such shareholder loan, the Chinese subsidiaries (as foreign-invested enterprises in China) must present evidence of payment of the withholding tax on the interest payable on any such shareholder loan and evidence of registration with the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, authorities as well as any other documents that the SAFE authorities may require. You may find additional information under Item 10. Additional Information  E. Taxation  Peoples Republic of China Taxation in this annual report. Risks Relating to Business Operations in China Changes in Chinese political and economic policies and conditions could adversely affect our business and prospects. China has been, and will continue to be, our primary production base and currently most of our assets are located in China. While the Chinese government has been pursuing economic reforms to transform its economy from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy since 1978, a significant part of the Chinese economy is still being operated under various controls of the Chinese government. By imposing industrial policies and other economic measures, such as control of foreign exchange, taxation and foreign investment, the Chinese government exerts considerable direct and indirect influence on the development of the Chinese economy. Many of the economic reforms carried out by the Chinese government are unprecedented or experimental and are expected to be refined and improved over time. Recently, the Chinese government has been contemplating and introducing in-depth structural reforms in China in order to further transition the Chinese economy into a market economy. Political, economic and social factors may also lead to further adjustments of the Chinese reform measures, including its fiscal and monetary policies. This reform and adjustment process may not necessarily have a positive effect on our operations and our future business development. Our business, prospects and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by changes in Chinese economic and social conditions and by changes in the policies of the Chinese government, such as measures to control inflation, changes in the rates or method of taxation, changes in government spending, and the imposition or lifting of restrictions on currency conversion. Changes in foreign exchange and foreign investment regulations in China may affect our ability to invest in China and the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to pay dividends and service debts in foreign currencies. The Renminbi is not a freely convertible currency at present. Although the Chinese government has recently been trying to internationalize the Renminbi, it continues to regulate conversion between Renminbi and foreign currencies. Changes in Chinese laws and regulations on foreign exchange may result in uncertainties in our financing and operating plans in China. Over the years, China has significantly reduced the governments control over routine foreign exchange transactions under current accounts, including trade and service related foreign exchange transactions, payment of dividends and service of foreign debts. In accordance with the existing foreign exchange regulations in China, our Chinese subsidiaries may, within the scope of current account transactions, pay dividends and service debts in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, there can be no assurance that the current Chinese foreign exchange policies with respect to debt service and payment of dividends in foreign currencies will continue in the future. Changes in Chinese foreign exchange policies may have a negative impact on our ability to service our foreign 36 Table of Contents currency-denominated indebtedness and to distribute dividends to our shareholders in foreign currencies since LDK Solar, as a Cayman Islands holding company, rely on our operating subsidiaries in China to convert their Renminbi cash flow to service such foreign debt and to make such dividend payments. Foreign exchange transactions by our Chinese subsidiaries under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls. In particular, foreign exchange transactions involving foreign direct investment, foreign debts and outbound investment in securities and derivatives are subject to limitations and require approvals from the relevant SAFE authorities. We have the choice, as permitted by the Chinese foreign investment regulations, to invest our net proceeds from our various offerings in the form of registered capital or a shareholder loan into our Chinese subsidiaries to finance our operations in China. Our choice of investment is affected by the different treatments under the relevant Chinese regulations with respect to capital-account and current-account foreign exchange transactions in China. For example, our transfer of funds to our subsidiaries in China is subject to approval of Chinese governmental authorities in case of an increase in registered capital, or subject to registration with Chinese governmental authorities in case of a shareholder loan. These and other limitations on the flow of funds between us and our Chinese subsidiaries could restrict our ability to act in response to changing market conditions and limit our flexibility in the management of our cash flow and financings. On the other hand, as the Chinese government is striving to internationalize the Renminbi, aiming to make it a trading, investment and reserve currency, we may not necessarily benefit from such efforts in our operations. The quantitative easing initiatives made by various central banks or similar institutions in the past have only made it more difficult for us to manage our foreign exchange risks. Were the Renminbi to become freely convertible, it may undergo unprecedented fluctuations under the market forces of supply and demand, and we may have to devote significantly more human and other resources in managing our assets, finances and cash flow denominated in Renminbi and in foreign currencies. We may, as a result, be confronted with more uncertainties in our financing and business operations, and we cannot assure that our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects will not be adversely affected by such efforts of the Chinese government to internationalize its currency, the Renminbi. The uncertain legal environment in China could have a negative impact on our business and prospects and also limit the legal protections available to you. Our principal operating subsidiaries, Jiangxi LDK Solar, Jiangxi LDK Silicon and LDK Nanchang, are foreign-invested enterprises in China and are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China in general and laws and regulations applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises and sino-foreign joint venture enterprises in particular. The Chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, the civil law system is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value. When the Chinese government started its economic reform in 1978, it began to formulate and promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations to provide general guidance on economic and business practices in China and to regulate foreign investments. China has made significant progress in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, the promulgation of new laws, changes in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may have a negative impact on our business and prospects. In addition, as these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent and because of the limited volume of published cases and their non-binding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, regulations and legal requirements involve significant uncertainties. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to foreign investors, including you. We may be treated as a Chinese resident enterprise for income tax purposes, which may subject us to Chinese income tax on our worldwide income. Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules, enterprises established outside mainland China whose de facto management bodies are located in mainland China are considered Chinese resident enterprises for income tax purposes. The implementation rules define the term de facto management body as a management body that exercises material and overall management control over the business, personnel, accounts and properties of 37 Table of Contents an enterprise. We hold our shareholders meetings and most of our board meetings outside mainland China and keep our register of shareholders outside mainland China. However, most of our directors and members of our senior management are currently based inside mainland China and we keep our books of account inside mainland China. The Chinese tax authorities may consider these circumstances relevant in determining whether we are a Chinese resident enterprise for income tax purposes. Although we have not been notified by any Chinese tax authorities that we are a Chinese resident enterprise under the Chinese tax law, and although it is unclear whether we have a de facto management body located in mainland China for Chinese tax purposes, we intend to take the position that we are not such a Chinese resident enterprise. We cannot assure you however that the Chinese tax authorities will agree with our position. If we are deemed a Chinese resident enterprise for income tax purposes, we will be subject to, among other things, the Chinese enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on our worldwide income excluding, however, the dividend income we receive from our Chinese subsidiaries. If we are treated as a Chinese resident enterprise under the Chinese tax law, we could face significant adverse tax consequences, which could adversely affect the value of our shares and ADSs. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by Chinese labor laws and regulations. The Chinese labor laws and regulations have a direct impact on our business operations. The Labor Contract Law of China, together with its implementation rules and regulations, aims at providing employees with greater protection in their employment relationships. For example, the labor contract law requires employers to enter into written contracts with their employees, and if an employer fails to enter into a written contract with an employee within one month of the commencement of the employment, the employer is required to pay to the employee double salary for the noncompliance period for up to one year. This labor law also calls for open-ended employment contracts rather than fixed-term contracts under specified circumstances. The law further prohibits an employer from entering into a one-year or shorter-term contract with an employee if it constitutes the third consecutive renewal of the employment contract unless it is so requested by the employee. As a result of this more labor-friendly legislation, our discretion in the hiring and termination process has been significantly curtailed, which could in turn affect our overall labor costs and our ability to adjust our labor needs in response to market changes. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could therefore be adversely affected by these Chinese labor laws and regulations. Chinese regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by Chinese residents may subject our Chinese resident shareholders to personal liability and limit our ability to acquire Chinese companies or to inject capital into our Chinese subsidiaries, limit our Chinese subsidiaries ability to distribute profits to us, or otherwise materially and adversely affect us. The SAFE rules and regulations require Chinese residents, both legal and natural persons, to register with the relevant SAFE authorities before they establish or take control of any company outside China for the purpose of acquiring any asset of or equity interest in Chinese companies and raising funds overseas. SAFE refers to such companies outside China as offshore special purpose companies in its notice. In addition, SAFE also requires any Chinese resident that is the shareholder of an offshore special purpose company to amend its SAFE registration with respect to the offshore special purpose company in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in China. If any Chinese shareholder of an offshore special purpose company fails to make the required SAFE registration and amendment, the Chinese subsidiaries of that offshore special purpose company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore special purpose company. Moreover, failure to comply with such SAFE registration and amendment requirements could result in liabilities under the Chinese law for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Our current beneficial owners who are Chinese residents have completed registration with the relevant SAFE authorities as required under the above-mentioned SAFE notice except for updating the registration with SAFE in connection with any change of their equity interests in us from time to time and the change of the assets and liabilities of our company as a result of any equity or debt offerings by us from time to 38 Table of Contents time. The failure of these beneficial owners to amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to the SAFE notice or the failure of our other future beneficial owners who are Chinese residents to comply with the SAFE registration requirements may subject such beneficial owners to fines and legal sanctions, and may also result in restrictions on our Chinese subsidiaries in their abilities to distribute profits to us, or may otherwise materially and adversely interfere with our business. All employee participants in our existing stock incentive plans who are Chinese citizens may be required to register with SAFE. We may also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt or use stock option for our directors and employees under Chinese laws. In March 2007, SAFE issued the Operating Procedures on Administration of Foreign Exchange Regarding Participation by Chinese Individuals in Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Stock Option Plan of Overseas Listed Companies, or the Stock Option Rule. It is not clear whether the Stock Option Rule covers any type of equity compensation plans or incentive plans which provide for the grant of ordinary share options or authorize the grant of restricted share awards. For plans so covered that are adopted by an overseas listed company, the Stock Option Rule requires the employee participants in those plans who are Chinese nationals to register with the relevant SAFE authorities within 10 days of the commencement of each quarter. In addition, the Stock Option Rule also requires the employee participants who are Chinese nationals to follow a series of requirements on making necessary applications for foreign exchange purchase quotas, opening special bank accounts and filings with the SAFE authorities before they exercise their stock options. Although we have assisted our employees in their registration with the SAFE authorities in connection with our stock incentive plans according to the Stock Option Rule, failure to comply with such provisions may subject us and the participants of our stock incentive plans who are Chinese nationals to monetary fines and other legal sanctions. Although, to date, we have not received any notice from any SAFE authorities regarding any legal sanctions applicable to us or our employees, we cannot assure you that we or our Chinese employees will not fail to comply with such provisions in the future or that any such failure will not prevent us from further granting options under our stock incentive plans to our employees, which could adversely affect our business operations as a result. Risks Relating to Our ADSs, Shares and Equity-linked Securities The market price of our ADSs has been and may continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investments to decline. Our ADSs were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, since our SEC-registered initial public offering SEC in June 2007 until March 31, 2014 when the staff of NYSE Regulation Inc. commenced proceedings to delist our ADSs from the NYSE. On September 22, 2014, NYSE Regulation, Inc. Board of Directors Committee for Review affirmed the delisting decision of the staff of NYSE Regulation, Inc. subsequent to a hearing with the Committee for Review. Our ADSs have been quoted on the OTC Pink Limited Information initially under the symbol LDKSY since the NYSE suspended the trading of our ADSs on February 21, 2014 and under the symbol LDKYQ since October 30, 2014. The market price of our ADSs experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. For the period from June 1, 2007 (commencement of trading of our ADSs on the NYSE) to February 21, 2014 (suspension by the NYSE of the trading of our ADSs on the NYSE), the closing price of our ADSs on the NYSE ranged from a high of $73.95 per ADS to a low of $0.71 per ADS. Since our ADSs have been quoted on the OTC market, their closing price has ranged from a high of $0.89 per ADS to a low of $0.07 per ADS up to the date of this annual report. 39 Table of Contents You may find additional information on the historical high and low closing prices of our ADSs under Item 9. The Offer and Listing  A. Offer and Listing Details  4. Information Regarding the Price History of the Stock and  C. Markets in this annual report. Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our ADSs, including, among other things:  prospects of the implementation of our restructuring offshore China;  prospects of continued standstill and forbearance by our creditors onshore China with respect to their lendings to us over the years;  prospects of the restructuring of our indebtedness onshore China;  dilutive effect of the convertible securities we have issued for the offshore restructuring on our capital structure, including potential change of control from time to time;  formulation and implementation of our goals and strategies;  impact and likely consequences of the current and on-going fluctuating PV market and overall global economic development on the PV market and on our businesses;  announcements of technological or competitive developments in the PV industry, solar power industry and renewable energy industry;  regulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, our customers or our competitors;  announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors;  announcements of studies and reports relating to the PV efficiencies of our products or those of our competitors;  our future business development, results of operations and financial condition, including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;  changes in financial estimates or other comments by securities analysts relating to us, our competitors or our industry in general;  release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ordinary shares, ADSs and equity-linked securities, such as our convertible securities;  a breach or default, or the perception of a possible breach or default, under our existing loan agreements, credit facilities or other debt instruments;  announcements by other companies in our industry relating to their operations, strategic initiatives, financial condition or performance or relating to our industry in general;  announcements of acquisitions or consolidations involving industry competitors or industry suppliers or customers;  changes in the market valuations of other PV technology companies;  determination of the fair value of our ordinary shares, ADSs, and equity-linked securities;  addition or departure of our executive officers and key personnel;  any government subsidies and economic incentives to us or to the PV industry;  sales or perceived sales of additional ordinary shares, ADSs or equity-linked securities by us or our shareholders and securities holders, including the conversion of their convertible securities;  pledges or perceived pledges of ordinary shares, ADSs or equity-linked securities by our shareholders and other securities holders, and the foreclosure or perceived foreclosure of such security interests, whether or not potentially resulting in a change of control; and  impact and development of any lawsuit or legal proceedings, currently pending or threatened, or that may be instituted in the future. 40 Table of Contents In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our ADS and equity-linked securities, regardless of our operating performance. The OTC market is a relatively illiquid market as compared to the NYSE, and will not be able to accommodate sales or purchases of any significant amount of our ADSs in any particular trading day. Furthermore, the trading price of our ADSs on the OTC market could be significantly affected by an otherwise relatively insignificant fluctuation of supply and demand relating to our ADSs. These factors, among others, could significantly depress the trading price of our ADSs and equity-linked securities. The offshore restructuring transactions completed under our schemes of arrangement will cause significant dilution to the equity ownership of our shareholders, which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs and equity-linked securities. Because of the limited funding available to the scheme creditors to choose the cash-out option, the restructuring transactions we completed pursuant to our schemes of arrangement have to offer significant amount of equity securities and convertible securities in exchange and satisfaction of claims of our scheme creditors. The issuances of such scale will necessarily cause material dilution of the equity holdings of our shareholders at any relevant time. You should read the information set forth under Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  A. Operating Results  Provisional Liquidation in this annual report for additional information. Because we are not issuing these equity securities or convertible securities for cash in the restructuring transactions, we will not receive any proceeds from these issuances. In addition, as our exit funding arrangements with HRX contain warrants and convertible securities, the issuance of our equity securities pursuant to such instruments may further dilute our shareholders at any relevant time. Such dilution may impose significant risks on us and our shareholders and may cause the value of our shares, ADSs and equity-linked securities to significantly decrease, including the possibility of being reduced to zero. Since quite a few of our convertible holders possess power to convert their convertible securities and cause a change of control in our shareholding structure, whether due to its previous substantial position in our 2014 senior notes or in our LDK Silicon preferred shares, we are placed under a present, constant and significant threat that a change of control may occur as a result from time to time. As we have disclosed in our various submissions of periodic reports on Form 6-K, you should understand that, depending on the volume-weighted average price, or VWAP, at any relevant time that our convertible holders will use for the conversion of their convertible securities, the dilutive effect due to an otherwise insignificant amount of conversions could be significant. In addition, although our convertible securities issued in our offshore restructuring contain some conversion volume restrictions on an annual and quarterly basis, such restrictions will end on March 31, 2016. The potential dilution on the equity interest of our shareholders may significantly increase at any time subsequent to March 31, 2016, and the trading prices of our shares, ADSs and equity-linked securities, including the convertible securities under our schemes of arrangement, will be subject to significant downward pressure. We may not be able to pay any dividends on our shares and ADSs. Under the Cayman Islands law, we may only pay dividends out of our profits or our share premium account subject to our ability to service our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of our business. Our ability to pay dividends will therefore depend on our ability to generate sufficient profits. We cannot give any assurance that we will declare dividends of any amount, at any rate or at all. We have not paid any dividend in the past. Future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital expenditure requirements, general financial condition, legal and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Because LDK Solar is a holding company, it relies principally on dividends, if any, paid by our subsidiaries to fund its dividend payments, if any, to our shareholders, including you, and any limitation on the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to pay dividends to LDK Solar could have a material adverse effect on its ability to pay dividends to you. You should refer to the 41 Table of Contents section entitled Item 8. Financial Information  A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information  Dividend Distribution Policy in this annual report for additional information regarding our current dividend policy. Our future financings, through sales of our ADSs, shares or equity-linked securities in the public market, may cause a dilution in your shareholding, cause the price of our ADSs to decline, or place restrictions on our operations. We may require additional funding to meet our working capital or capital expenditure requirements or in connection with our acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions in the future. If we raise such funding through issuance of new equity or equity-linked securities, it may cause a dilution in the percentage ownership of our then existing shareholders. The offshore restructuring transactions have already required us to issue a significant amount of equity and convertible securities in exchange for the claims of our various creditors, as we have disclosed in the risk factor entitled  The offshore restructuring transactions completed under our schemes of arrangement will cause significant dilution to the equity ownership of our shareholders, which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs and equity-linked securities above. Sales of a substantial number of ADSs or other equity-linked securities in the public market could depress the market price of our ADSs, and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our ADSs or other equity-linked securities would have on the market price of our ADSs. Alternatively, if we decide to meet our funding requirements by way of additional debt financing, to the extent we could do so in compliance with the various covenants and other restrictions contained in our existing financing arrangements, we may cause additional restrictions placed on us through such debt financing arrangements, which may:  limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek consents before we pay dividends;  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limit our ability to pursue our business strategies;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditure, working capital requirements and other general corporate needs; and  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and/or our industry. Sales by our existing shareholders of our ADSs, shares or equity-linked securities in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities held by our significant shareholders or any financial institutions, or the availability of these securities for future sale, will have on the market price of our ADSs. The price of our ADSs may decline as a result. Holders of ADSs have fewer rights than shareholders and must act through the depositary to exercise those rights. Holders of ADSs do not have the same rights as our shareholders and may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying shares in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Upon receipt of voting instructions from ADS holders, the depositary will endeavor to vote the underlying shares in accordance with these instructions. Otherwise, ADS holders will not be able to exercise their right to vote unless they withdraw the shares underlying their ADSs and vote such shares directly. Under our currently effective articles of association, as amended and restated, the minimum notice period required to convene a general meeting is 10 clear days. When a general meeting is convened, ADS holders may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders meeting to permit such holders to withdraw their shares to allow them to cast their vote with 42 Table of Contents respect to any specific matter. If requested in writing by us, the depositary will mail a notice of such a meeting to ADS holders. In addition, the depositary and its agents may not be able to send voting instructions to ADS holders or carry out ADS holders voting instructions in a timely manner. Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote. As a result, you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and you may lack recourse if the ADSs are not voted as you have requested. In addition, in your capacity as an ADS holder, you will not be able to call a general meeting of our shareholders. You may be subject to limitations on transfers of ADSs. The ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement or our articles of association, or for any other reason. You may not receive distributions on shares or any value for them if it is unlawful or impractical to make them available to you. Subject to the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement, the depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the ADS custodian receives on shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of shares your ADSs represent. However, the depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holder of ADSs, in which case it may determine not to make such a distribution. Neither we nor the depositary has any obligation to register ADSs, shares, rights or other securities subject to such distribution under U.S. securities laws. Neither we nor the depositary has any obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of ADSs, shares, rights or anything else to holders of ADSs. This means that you may not receive the distribution we make on our shares or any value for the distribution if it is unlawful or impractical for us to make it available to you. These restrictions may have a material adverse effect on the value of your ADSs. You may not be able to participate in rights offerings or elect to receive stock dividends and may experience dilution of your holdings, and the sale, deposit, cancellation and transfer of our ADSs issued after exercise of rights may be restricted. If we offer our shareholders any rights to subscribe for additional shares or any other rights, the depositary may make these rights available to you after consultation with us. We cannot make rights available to you in the United States unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. In addition, under the deposit agreement, the depositary will not distribute rights to holders of ADSs unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities to which these rights relate are either exempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs, or are registered by us under the provisions of the Securities Act. We can give no assurance that we will be able to establish an exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to these rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have any such registration statement declared effective. Accordingly, you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result. The depositary may allow rights that are not distributed or sold to lapse. In that case, you will receive no value for them. In addition, U.S. securities laws may restrict the sale, deposit, cancellation and transfer of ADSs issued after exercise of rights. 43 Table of Contents Anti-takeover provisions of our articles of association could prevent a change in control even if such takeover is beneficial to our shareholders. Our articles of association contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our company that could be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for our ADSs. These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a price above the then current market price of our ADSs. These provisions provide that our board of directors has authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations, powers, preferences, privileges, and relative participating, optional or special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption (subject to approval of our shareholders if so required under our articles of association) and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our shares, in the form of ADSs or otherwise. Our board of directors may decide to issue such preferred shares quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make the removal of our management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue such preferred shares, the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of holders of our shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. We are a Cayman Islands company and, because judicial precedent regarding the rights of shareholders is more limited under the Cayman Islands law than that under the U.S. law, ADS holders may have less protection for their shareholder rights than such holders would under the U.S. law. We are a Cayman Islands company and our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, as amended, the Cayman Islands companies law and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders to take action against our directors, actions that may be taken by our minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under the Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedents in the Cayman Islands as well as those from the English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under the Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they are under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws than the United States. In addition, some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. Furthermore, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. Substantially all of our assets and a substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. The Cayman Islands courts are also unlikely:  to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws; and  to impose liabilities against us, in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws that are penal in nature. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the Cayman Islands will generally recognize and enforce a non-penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits. As a result of all of these limitations, our shareholders and holders of ADSs may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by our management, board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as shareholders of a public company incorporated and existing under the laws of a jurisdiction in the United States. 44 Table of Contents You may have difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us. As disclosed in this annual report, we are a Cayman Islands company and substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. Most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. In addition, substantially all of our current operations are conducted in China. As a result, it may be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors. It may also be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or officers. Furthermore, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands or China would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any of its states. It is also uncertain whether such Cayman Islands or Chinese courts would be competent to hear original actions brought in the Cayman Islands or China against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any of its states.
