RISK FACTORS We have a history of losses and our future profitability on a quarterly or annual basis is uncertain, which could have a harmful effect on our business and the value of ZAP's common stock. We incurred net losses of $9.8 million, $28 million, $11.9 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. We can give no assurance that we will be able to operate profitably in the future. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE. In the advanced technology vehicle market in the United States, we compete with large manufacturers, including GM, Honda, Toyota, and Chrysler, who have more significant financial resources, established market positions, long-standing relationships with customers and dealers, and who have more significant name recognition, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution, financial and other resources than we do. Each of these companies is currently working to develop, market, and sell advanced technology vehicles in the United States market. The resources available to our competitors to develop new products and introduce them into the marketplace exceed the resources currently available to us. We also face competition from smaller companies with respect to our consumer products, such as our electric bicycle and scooter. This intense competitive environment may require us to make changes in our products, pricing, licensing, services, distribution, or marketing to develop, maintain, and extend our current technology and market position. CHANGES IN THE MARKET FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES COULD CAUSE OUR PRODUCTS TO BECOME OBSOLETE OR LOSE POPULARITY. The electric vehicle industry is in its infancy and has experienced substantial change in the last few years. To-date, demand for and interest in electric vehicles has been sporadic. As a result, growth in the electric vehicle industry depends on many factors, including: o continued development of product technology; o the environmental consciousness of customers; o the ability of electric vehicles to successfully compete with vehicles powered by internal combustion engines; o widespread electricity shortages and the resultant increase in electricity prices, especially in our primary market, California, which could derail our past and present efforts to promote electric vehicles as a practical solution to vehicles which require gasoline; and o whether future regulation and legislation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles is enacted. 8 We cannot assure you that growth in the electric vehicle industry will continue. Our business may suffer if the electric vehicle industry does not grow or grows more slowly than it has in recent years or if we are unable to maintain the pace of industry demands. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY AND, AS A RESULT, MAY SUFFER A DECLINE IN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. Our current products are designed for use with, and are dependent upon, existing electric vehicle technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our products in order to continue to provide products with the latest technology. However, our products may become obsolete or our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in or create necessary technology. As a result, our potential inability to adapt and develop the necessary technology may harm our competitive position. THE FAILURE OF CERTAIN KEY SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE US WITH COMPONENTS COULD HAVE A SEVERE AND NEGATIVE IMPACT UPON OUR BUSINESS. We rely on a small group of suppliers to provide us with components for our products, some of whom are located outside of the United States. If these suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide components, there are a limited number of alternative suppliers who could provide them. Changes in business conditions, wars, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate could affect our ability to receive components from our suppliers. Further, it could be difficult to find replacement components if our current suppliers fail to provide the parts needed for these products. A failure by our major suppliers to provide these components could severely restrict our ability to manufacture our products and prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion. PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHER CLAIMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. The risk of product liability claims, product recalls, and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of electrical vehicles. Although we have product liability insurance for our consumer products for risks of up to an aggregate of $5,000,000, that insurance may be inadequate to cover all potential product claims. We also carry liability insurance on our automobile products. Any product recall or lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates. We cannot assure you that such claims and/or recalls will not be made in the future. WE MUST DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENTING A PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. Our dealers are often hesitant to provide their own financing to contribute to our product distribution network. As a result, we anticipate that we may have to provide financing or other consignment sale arrangements for dealers who would like to participate as our regional distribution centers. The further expansion of our product distribution network will require a significant capital investment and will require extensive amounts of time from our management. A capital investment such as this presents many risks, foremost among them being that we may not realize a significant return on our investment if the network is not profitable. Our inability to collect receivables from our dealers could cause us to suffer losses. Lastly, the amount of time that our management will need to devote to this project may divert them from performing other functions necessary to assure the success of our business. FAILURE TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. We plan to increase sales and expand our operations substantially during the next several years through internally-generated growth and the acquisition of businesses and products. 9 To manage our growth, we believe we must continue to implement and improve our operational, manufacturing, and research and development departments. We may not have adequately evaluated the costs and risks associated with this expansion, and our systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, our management may not be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully offer our products and services and implement our business plan on a profitable basis. The success of our future operating activities will also depend upon our ability to expand our support system to meet the demands of our growing business. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement, and manage changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully operate acquired businesses, become profitable in the future, or effectively manage any other change. An inability to successfully operate recently acquired businesses and manage existing business would harm our operations. THE LOSS OF CERTAIN KEY PERSONNEL COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR BUSINESS. The Company's performance is substantially dependent upon the services of its executive officers and other key employees, as well as on its ability to recruit, retain, and motivate other officers and key employees. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and there are a limited number of people with knowledge of and experience in the advanced technology vehicle industry. The loss of services of any of our officers or key employees, or our inability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, will harm our business. Specifically, the loss of Mr. Schneider, our Chief Executive Officer or Mr. Starr, our founder, who is also head of our R&D efforts, whose specialized knowledge of the electric vehicle industry is essential to our business, would be detrimental. We have employment agreements with Mr. Schneider and Mr. Starr that provide for their continued service to the Company until October 1, 2013. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT UPON OUR BUSINESS. While our products are subject to substantial regulation under federal, state, and local laws, we believe that the products we have sold are materially in compliance with all applicable laws. However, to the extent the laws change, or if we introduce new products in the future, some or all of our products may not comply with applicable federal, state, or local laws. Further, certain federal, state, and local laws and industrial standards currently regulate electrical and electronics equipment. Although standards for electric vehicles are not yet generally available or accepted as industry standards, our products may become subject to federal, state, and local regulation in the future. Compliance with this regulation could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. Our automobile products are subject to environmental and safety compliance with various federal and state regulations, including regulations promulgated by the EPA, NHTSA, and Air Resource Board of the State of California, and compliance certification is required for each new model year. The cost of these compliance activities and the delays and risks associated with obtaining approval can be substantial. Although the Company had marketed its Smart Car product in the United States, the car must be certified by the California Air Resources Board before it can be sold in California, New York, and three other states. In addition, the two models of our OBVIO products will need to satisfy all regulatory requirements before they can be sold in the United States. The risks, delays, and expenses incurred in connection with such compliance could be substantial. MANUFACTURING OVERSEAS MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR US. We have been shifting our manufacturing overseas. There are many risks associated with international business. These risks include, but are not limited to, language barriers, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political and economic instability, regulatory compliance difficulties, problems enforcing agreements, and greater exposure of our intellectual property to markets where a high probability of unlawful appropriation may occur. A failure to successfully mitigate any of these potential risks could damage our business. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTERNET ADDRESS. We currently hold the internet address, http://www.zapworld.com, a portal through which we sell our products. We may not be able to prevent third parties from acquiring internet addresses that are confusingly similar to our address, which could adversely affect our business. Governmental agencies and their designees generally regulate the 10 acquisition and maintenance of internet addresses. However, the regulation of internet addresses in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain relevant internet addresses in all countries where we conduct business. OUR SUCCESS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protections to protect our proprietary technology. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to obtain trademarks and patents. We hold several patents registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. These registrations include both design patents and utility patents. In addition, we have recently submitted provisional patents which may or may not be afforded the limited protection associated with provisional patents. We have also registered numerous trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and have several pending at this time. We cannot assure you that the trademarks and patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted under those registrations will provide competitive advantages to us. We also rely on trade secrets and new technologies to maintain our competitive position. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants, we cannot be certain that others will not gain access to these trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO LIABILITY FOR INFRINGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHER COMPANIES. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Although we have conducted searches and are not aware of any patents and trademarks which our products or their use might infringe, we cannot be certain that infringement has not or will not occur. We could incur substantial costs, in addition to the great amount of time lost, in defending any patent or trademark infringement suits or in asserting any patent or trademark rights, in a suit with another party. RISK OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES OFFERING. In the past, we have had numerous sales of our securities which were not registered under federal or state securities laws. We have strived to comply with all applicable Federal and state securities laws in connection with our issuances of unregistered securities. However, to the extent we have not complied, there may be liability for the purchase price of the securities sold together with interest and the potential of regulatory sanctions. OUR STOCK PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME MAY BE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS. The equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock over the past few years. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations. We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We have not achieved profitable operations and if we do realize a profit in the future, we anticipate that we will retain all future earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of our business. Accordingly, we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends will be at the direction of our board of directors after taking into account many factors, including our operating results, financial conditions, current and anticipated cash needs and plans for expansion. 11 SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS The Company's business is subject to seasonal influences for consumer products. Sales volumes in this industry typically slow down during the winter months, November to March in the U.S. The Company's auto distribution network is affected by the availability of cars ready to sell to dealers. INFLATION Our raw materials and finished products and automobiles are sourced from stable, cost-competitive industries. As such, we do not foresee any material inflationary trends for our product sources. SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF PARTS AND SUPPLIES Materials, parts, supplies and services used in our business are generally available from a variety of sources. However, interruptions in production or delivery of these goods could have an adverse impact on our general operations, or our manufacturer's operations and production of ZAP products. We strive to have dual sources.

We anticipate shipping these units from on hand inventory and future shipments. ZAP has a ready supply of Xebras from our China manufacturer. The backlog for our consumer products on the same date was $18,000. We anticipate shipping the consumer products throughout the year of 2009. COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS The competition to develop and market advanced technology vehicles has been intense and is expected to continue to increase. Our principal competitive advantages over our competitors are our ownership of fundamental technology, our trade name and brand recognition, our ability to be a low cost manufacturer through domestic and international contract manufacturing arrangements and our growing distribution network. We benefit from our high name recognition in the advanced transportation vehicle industry coupled with a rapidly developing consumer sales business on our website. In order to reduce costs, our production activities have been transferred to lower cost contract manufacturers outside the United States, which enables us to offer our products at competitive prices. This also enables us to concentrate on our marketing and sales efforts and the growth of our distribution network. We offer one of the broadest lines of personal electric vehicles currently available, which we believe reinforces our name recognition in the market place. In the advanced technology vehicle market in the United States, we compete with large manufacturers, including Honda and Toyota, who have more significant financial resources, established market positions, longstanding relationships with customers and dealers, and who have more significant name recognition, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources than we do. Each of these companies is currently working to develop, market and sell advanced technology vehicles in the United States market. The resources available to our competitors to develop new products and introduce them into the market place exceed the resources currently available to our Company. We also face competition from smaller companies with respect to our consumer products, such as our electric bicycle and scooter. We expect to face competition from the makers of consumer batteries and small electronics with respect to the ZAP portable energy line. This intense competitive environment may require us to make changes in our products, pricing, licensing, services, distribution or marketing to develop, maintain and extend our current technology and market position. EMPLOYEES As of March 30, 2009, the Company had a total of 48 employees. We have employment agreements with the following: Mr. Schneider (Chief Executive Officer and Director), Mr. Starr (Head of R&D), until 2013, Mr. Hartman (Chief Financial Officer) until August 2009 with annual extensions and Mr. Kazzaz (Chief Operating Officer) until 2010. We believe our employee relations are generally good. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. 13
