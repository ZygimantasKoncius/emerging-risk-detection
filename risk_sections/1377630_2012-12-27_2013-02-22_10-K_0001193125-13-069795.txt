Item 1A. Risk Factors Ownership of the common stock of the Company involves certain risks. Holders of the Companys securities and prospective investors should consider carefully the following risks and other information in this document, including our historical financial statements and related notes included herein. The risks and uncertainties described in this document are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in this document actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps significantly, and you may lose part or all of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Changes in the ESAs with, or lack of support by, NCM LLCs founding members could adversely affect our revenue, growth and profitability The ESAs with NCM LLCs founding members are critical to our business. The three ESAs each have an initial term of 30 years beginning February 13, 2007 and provide us with a five-year right of first refusal, which begins one year prior to the end of the term of the ESA on February 13, 2037. The current term of the ESAs as they relate to the Fathom Consumer division, is approximately five years from December 29, 2011 until 2016 with provisions for automatic renewals for a series of additional five year terms through February 2037, if certain financial performance conditions are met. The financial performance conditions for the Fathom Business division for the period ending December 29, 2011 were not met and certain of the rights and obligations associated with that part of the Fathom business were transferred back to NCM LLCs founding members. NCM LLCs founding 22 Table of Contents members theatres represent approximately 80% of the screens and approximately 84% of the attendance in our network as of December 27, 2012. If any one of the ESAs was terminated, not renewed at its expiration or found to be unenforceable, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and financial condition. The ESAs require the cooperation, investment and support of NCM LLCs founding members, the absence of which could adversely affect us. Pursuant to the ESAs, NCM LLCs founding members must make investments to replace digital network equipment within their theatres and equip newly constructed theatres with digital network equipment. If NCM LLCs founding members do not have adequate financial resources or operational strength, and if they do not replace equipment or equip new theatres to maintain the level of operating functionality that we have today, or if such equipment becomes obsolete, we may have to make additional capital expenditures or our advertising, Fathom Events revenue and operating margins may decline. If NCM LLCs founding members reject advertising or choose not to participate in certain Fathom Consumer events under the terms of the ESAs because they believe it would adversely affect their film attendance levels or the reputation of their company, our revenue from that business would be reduced. If the non-competition provisions of the ESAs are deemed unenforceable, NCM LLCs founding members could compete against us and our business could be adversely affected With certain limited exceptions, each of the ESAs prohibits the applicable NCM LLC founding member from engaging in any of the business activities that we provide in NCM LLCs founding members theatres under the ESA, and from owning interests in other entities that compete with us. These provisions are intended to prevent NCM LLCs founding members from harming our business by providing cinema advertising services directly to their theatres or by entering into agreements with third-party cinema advertising providers. However, under state and federal law, a court may determine that a non-competition covenant is unenforceable, in whole or in part, for reasons including, but not limited to, the courts determination that the covenant:  is not necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement;  unreasonably restrains the party against whom enforcement is sought; or  is contrary to the public interest. Enforceability of a non-competition covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought. For this reason, it is not possible for us to predict whether, or to what extent, a court would enforce the non-competition provisions contained in the ESAs. If a court were to determine that the non-competition provisions are unenforceable, NCM LLCs founding members could compete directly against us or enter into an agreement with another cinema advertising provider that competes against us. Any inability to enforce the non-competition provisions, in whole or in part could cause our revenue to decline. Because we rely heavily on NCM LLCs founding members and our network affiliates ability to attract customers, any reduction in attendance at NCM LLC network theatres could reduce our revenue. Our business is affected by the success of NCM LLCs founding members and to a lesser extent our network affiliates, who operate in a highly competitive industry whose attendance is reliant on the presence of motion pictures that attract audiences. From the late 1990s through 2002, the number of movie screens and the level of theatre attendance in the U.S. increased substantially, as movie theatres began to offer new amenities such as stadium seating, improved projection quality and superior sound systems, and studios began to increase the number of motion pictures produced and increased the budgets to market those films. Annual theatre attendance has fluctuated over the last several years depending on the quality of motion pictures released by the major and independent studios. Over the last 20 years theatre attendance has fluctuated from year to year but on average has grown by an aggregate annual rate of approximately 1%. If future theatre attendance declines significantly over an extended time period, one or more of NCM LLCs founding members or network affiliates 23 Table of Contents may face financial difficulties and could be forced to sell or close theatres or reduce the number of screens it builds or upgrades. Attendance may also decline if NCM LLCs founding members fail to maintain their theatres and provide amenities that consumers prefer, if they cannot compete successfully on pricing or if studios begin to reduce their investments in feature films or reduce the investments made to market those films. NCM LLCs network theatre circuits also may not successfully compete for licenses to exhibit quality films and are not assured a consistent supply of motion pictures since they do not have long-term arrangements with major film distributors. Any of these circumstances could reduce our revenue because our national advertising revenue, and local advertising to a lesser extent, depends on the number of theatre patrons who view our advertising and pre-feature show. If one of NCM LLCs founding members declared bankruptcy, the ESA with that NCM LLC founding member may be rejected, renegotiated or deemed unenforceable Each of NCM LLCs founding members currently has a significant amount of indebtedness, which is below investment grade. In 2000 and 2001, several major motion picture exhibition companies filed for bankruptcy including United Artists, Edwards Theatres and Regal Cinemas (which are predecessor companies to Regal), and General Cinemas and Loews Cineplex (which are predecessor companies to AMC). The industry-wide construction of larger, more expensive megaplexes featuring stadium seating in the late 1990s that rendered existing, smaller, sloped-floor theatres under long-term leases obsolete and unprofitable, were significant contributing factors to these bankruptcies. If a bankruptcy case were commenced by or against an NCM LLC founding member, it is possible that all or part of the ESA with that NCM LLC founding member could be rejected by a trustee in the bankruptcy case pursuant to Section 365 or Section 1123 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or by the NCM LLC founding member, and thus not be enforceable. Alternatively, the NCM LLC founding member could seek to renegotiate the ESA in a manner less favorable to us than the existing agreement. Should the NCM LLC founding member seek to sell or otherwise dispose of theatres or remove theatres from our network through bankruptcy or for other business reasons, if the acquirer did not agree to continue to allow us to sell advertising in the acquired theatres the number of theatres in our advertising networks would be reduced which in turn would reduce the number of advertising impressions available to us and thus could reduce our advertising revenue. The recent and ongoing global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition The financial markets have experienced extreme disruption and the world-wide economy remains fragile. Declining consumer confidence may lead to decreased demand or delay in payments by our advertising customers. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. These challenging economic conditions also may result in:  increased competition for fewer advertising and entertainment programming dollars;  pricing pressure that may adversely affect revenue and gross margin;  reduced credit availability and/or access to capital markets;  difficulty forecasting, budgeting and planning due to limited visibility into the spending plans of current or prospective customers; or  customer financial difficulty and increased risk of doubtful accounts receivable. The markets for advertising and event content are competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully The market for advertising is very competitive. Cinema advertising is a small component of the overall U.S. advertising market and thus we must compete with established, larger and better known national and local media platforms such as cable, broadcast and satellite television networks and newly emerging media platforms including on the internet such as online video services. We compete for advertising directly with all media platforms, including radio and television broadcasting, cable and satellite television services, various local print media, billboards and internet and mobile platforms. 24 Table of Contents We also compete directly with other cinema advertising companies. We expect these competitors to devote significant effort to maintaining and growing their respective market shares. We also expect existing competitors and new entrants to the cinema advertising business to constantly revise and improve their business models in light of challenges from us or competing media platforms. If we cannot respond effectively to advances by our competitors, our business may be adversely affected. Our Fathom Consumer division focuses on the distribution of entertainment programming products. It includes live and pre-recorded concerts, opera, symphony and other types of music events, concert and DVD product releases, theatrical premieres, Broadway plays, as well as live sports and other special events. This business competes for music, sports and other entertainment programming with event venues and other national entertainment networks, some of which offer greater geographic reach and larger audiences. Accordingly, our ability to source a consistent flow of programming is contingent on our ability to develop and sustain relationships with content owners and our ability to continue to expand our network. Significant declines in theatre attendance could reduce the attractiveness of cinema advertising The value of our advertising business could be adversely affected by a long-term multi-year decline in theatre attendance or even the perception by media buyers that our network was no longer relevant to their marketing plan due to the decreases in attendance and geographic coverage. Factors that could reduce attendance at our network theatres include the following:  the shortening of the release window between the release of major motion pictures in the theatres and release to alternative methods for delivering movies to consumers, such as DVD or HD DVD, cable television, downloads via downloads on the internet, video discs, video on demand, satellite and pay-per-view services;  any reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general that reduces the demand for motion pictures or adversely affects the motion picture production industry; and  the success of first-run motion pictures, which depends upon the production and marketing efforts of the major studios and the attractiveness and value proposition of the movies to consumers compared to other forms of entertainment. The loss of any major content partner or advertising customer could significantly reduce our revenue We derive a significant portion of our revenue from our contracts with our content partners, cell phone PSA and NCM LLCs founding members agreements to purchase on-screen advertising for their beverage concessionaires. We currently have marketing relationships with eight content partners. None of these companies individually accounted for over 10% of our total revenue during the year ended December 27, 2012. However, the agreements with the content partners, cell phone PSA and beverage advertising with NCM LLCs founding members in aggregate accounted for approximately 28%, 31% and 27% of our total revenue during the years ended December 27, 2012, December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, respectively. Because we derive a significant percentage of our total revenue from a relatively small number of large companies, the loss of them as a customer could decrease our revenue and adversely affect current and future operating results. We generate a high percentage of our revenue and OIBDA from advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could have a serious adverse effect on our business We generated approximately 91.2% of our total revenue in the year ended December 27, 2012 from advertising sales (80.2% from national and 19.8% from local). A substantial portion of our advertising inventory is covered by contracts with terms of a month or less. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if they believe our advertising medium is ineffective or overly expensive. In addition, large advertisers generally have set advertising budgets, most of which are focused on traditional media platforms like television and recently the 25 Table of Contents internet. Reductions in the size of advertisers budgets due to local or national economic trends, a shift in spending to new advertising mediums like the internet and mobile platforms or other factors could result in lower spending on cinema advertising. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertising clients, they may reduce their advertising purchases or stop placing advertisements with us, which would negatively affect our revenue and ability to generate new business from advertising clients. If we do not maintain our technological advantage, our business could fail to grow and revenue and operating margins could decline Failure to successfully or cost-effectively implement upgrades to our in-theatre advertising network could limit our ability to offer our clients innovative unique and integrated marketing products, which could limit our future revenue growth. Any failure by us to upgrade our technology to remain competitive, which may be adopted by other advertising platforms, could hurt our ability to compete with those companies. Under the terms of the ESAs with NCM LLCs founding members, they are required to provide technology that is consistent with that in place at the signing of the ESA. We may request that NCM LLCs founding members upgrade the equipment or software installed in their theatres, but we must negotiate with NCM LLCs founding members as to the terms of such upgrade, including cost sharing terms, if any. For instance, during 2010 we entered into an amendment to the ESA to allow us to connect our digital network to NCM LLCs founding members new digital cinema projection systems so that we could display our advertising and Fathom Events (including 3-D) on the higher quality systems. As of December 27, 2012 we had 14,464 screens within our network that were connected to digital cinema projection equipment and expect approximately 16,000 screens, or 80% of our total screens and 15,100 screens, or 95% of NCM LLCs founding members screens to be deployed with digital cinema equipment by the end of 2013. If we are not able to come to an agreement on a future upgrade request, we may elect to pay for the upgrades requested which could result in our incurring significant capital expenditures, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the failure or delay in implementation of such upgrades or problems with the integration of our systems and software with the digital cinema systems could slow or prevent the growth of our business. Our business relies heavily on our technology systems, and any failures or disruptions may materially and adversely affect our operations The temporary or permanent loss of our computer equipment and software systems, through sabotage, operating malfunction, software virus, human error, natural disaster, power loss, terrorist attacks, or other catastrophic events, could disrupt our operations and cause a material adverse impact. These problems may arise in both internally developed systems and the systems of third-party service providers. If our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation. Technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements. Our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth, and we may be unable to effectively manage or continue our growth of our network and advertising inventory We have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our management and operational infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our services could suffer which could negatively affect our brand and our relationships with our current advertising clients. Additionally, we may not be able to continue to expand our network and our advertising inventory which could negatively affect our ability to add new advertising clients and providers of content for our Fathom Consumer business. To effectively manage this growth and continue to expand our network and inventory, we will need to continue to improve our DCS software and our internal management systems, including our advertising inventory optimization and financial reporting systems which we are currently upgrading. These enhancements and improvements could require an additional allocation of financial and management resources. If the improvements are not implemented 26 Table of Contents successfully in a timely manner, our ability to manage our limited advertising inventory and continue our growth in the future will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to address these issues. Our plans for developing additional revenue opportunities may not be implemented, may require substantial expenditures and may not be achieved In addition to our strategy to grow our advertising and Fathom Consumer business, we are also considering other potential opportunities for revenue growth, which we describe in BusinessOur StrategyExpand our Internet/Mobile Platform. The development of our internet advertising network and mobile apps and the integration of these marketing products with our core on-screen and theatre lobby production is at an early stage, and may not deliver future benefits we are planning for. Should these networks not continue to grow in importance to advertising clients and agencies, they may not provide a way to help expand our cinema advertising business as it matures and begins to compete with new or improved advertising platforms including online and mobile video services. We depend upon our senior management and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot retain or replace them Our success depends upon the retention of our experienced senior management with specialized industry, sales and technical knowledge and/or industry relationships. We might not be able to find qualified replacements for our senior management if their services were no longer available to us; accordingly, the loss of critical members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy and our relationships with advertisers and content partners. We do not have key-man life insurance covering any of our employees. Our business, services, or technology may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others, which may interfere with our ability to provide services or expose us to increased liability or expense Intellectual property rights of our business include the copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents of our in-theatre, online, and mobile services, including the websites we operate at ncm.com, movienightout.com, firstlookonline.com and FathomEvents.com and the features, functionality, content, and software we make available through those websites. We rely on our own intellectual property rights as well as intellectual property rights obtained from third parties to conduct our business and provide our in-theatre, online, and mobile services. We may discover that our business or the technology we use to provide our in-theatre, online, or mobile services infringes patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights owned by others. In addition, our competitors or others may claim rights in patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to provide our in-theatre, online, or mobile services either in the U.S. or in international markets. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. The content we distribute through our in-theatre, online or mobile services may expose us to liability Our in-theatre, online, and mobile services facilitate the distribution of content. This content includes advertising-related content, as well as movie and television content, music and other media, much of which is obtained from third parties. Our websites also include features enabling users to upload or add their own content to the websites and modify certain content on the websites. As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement, or other claims based on the content that we distribute. We or entities that we license content from may not be adequately insured or indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us. 27 Table of Contents The personal information we collect and maintain through our online and mobile services may expose us to liability In order to take advantage of some of the online and mobile services we provide users are required to establish an account on one of our websites. As a result, we will collect and maintain personal information about those users. We also collect and maintain personal information about users who view certain advertising displayed through our online and mobile services. Our collection and use of information regarding users of our online and mobile services could result in legal liability. For example, the failure, or perceived failure, to comply with federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws or regulations or our posted privacy policies could result in actions against us by governmental entities or others. Changes in regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our online or mobile services may result in the need to alter our business practices or incur greater operating expenses A number of regulations, including those referenced below, may impact our business as a result of our online or mobile services. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, liability for posting, or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights. Portions of the Communications Decency Act are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third-party content. The Child Online Protection Act and the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. The costs of compliance with these regulations, and other regulations relating to our online and mobile services or other areas of our business, may be significant. The manner in which these and other regulations may be interpreted or enforced may subject us to potential liability, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Changes to these and other regulations may impose additional burdens on us or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results because of, for example, increased costs relating to legal compliance, defense against adverse claims or damages, or the reduction or elimination of features, functionality or content from our online or mobile services. Likewise, any failure on our part to comply with these and other regulations may subject us to additional liabilities. Our revenue and Adjusted OIBDA fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be unpredictable, which could increase the volatility of our stock price A weak advertising market or the shift in spending of a major client from one quarter to another, the poor performance of films released in a given quarter or a disruption in the release schedule of films could significantly affect quarter-to-quarter results or even affect results for the entire fiscal year. Because our results may vary from quarter to quarter and may be unpredictable, our financial results for one quarter cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter and may not be indicative of our financial performance in subsequent quarters. These variations in our financial results could contribute to volatility in our stock price. The ESAs allow the founding members to engage in activities that might compete with certain elements of our business, which could reduce our revenue and growth potential The ESAs contain certain limited exceptions to our exclusive right to use the founding members theatres for our advertising business. The founding members have the right to enter into a limited number of strategic cross-marketing relationships with third-party, unaffiliated businesses for the purpose of generating increased attendance or revenue (other than revenue from the sale of advertising). These strategic marketing relationships can include the use of one minute on the LEN and certain types of lobby promotions and can be provided at no cost, but only for the purpose of promoting the products or services of those businesses while at the same time promoting the theatre circuit or the movie-going experience. The use of LEN or lobby promotions by NCM LLCs founding members for these advertisements and programs could result in the founding members creating relationships with advertisers that could adversely affect our current LEN and lobby promotions advertising revenue and profitability as well as the potential we have to grow that advertising revenue in the 28 Table of Contents future. The LEN and lobby promotions represented 4.7% of our total advertising revenue for the year ended December 27, 2012. The founding members do not have the right to use their movie screens (including the FirstLook program or otherwise) for promoting these cross-marketing relationships, and thus we will have the exclusive rights to advertise on the movie screens, except for limited advertising related to theatre operations. The founding members also have the right to install a second network of video monitors in the theatre lobbies in excess of those required to be installed by the founding members for the LEN. This additional lobby video network, which we refer to as the founders lobby network, may be used by the founding members to promote products or services related to operating the theatres, such as concessions and loyalty programs. The presence of the founders lobby network within the lobby areas could reduce the effectiveness of our LEN, thereby reducing our current LEN advertising revenue and profitability and adversely affecting future revenue potential associated with that marketing platform. Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure We are a holding company with no operations of our own, and we depend on distributions and payments under the NCM LLC operating and management services agreements from NCM LLC to meet our ongoing obligations and to pay cash dividends on our common stock We are a holding company with no operations of our own and have no independent ability to generate revenue. Consequently, our ability to obtain operating funds depends upon distributions from NCM LLC. The distribution of cash flows and other transfers of funds by NCM LLC to us are subject to statutory and contractual restrictions based upon NCM LLCs financial performance, including NCM LLCs compliance with the covenants in its senior secured credit facility and indentures, and the NCM LLC operating agreement. The NCM LLC senior secured credit facility and indentures limit NCM LLCs ability to distribute cash to its members, including us, based upon certain leverage tests, with exceptions for, among other things, payment of our income taxes and a management fee to NCM, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the management services agreement (incorporated in the ESA). See the information provided under Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for leverage discussion. Once the NCM, Inc. cash balances and investments ($96.2 million as of December 27, 2012 versus $88.9 million as of December 29, 2011) are extinguished, we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders or pay other expenses outside the ordinary course of business if NCM LLC fails to comply with these covenants and is unable to distribute cash to us. Pursuant to the management services agreement between us and NCM LLC, NCM LLC makes payments to us to fund our day-to-day operating expenses, such as payroll. However, if NCM LLC has insufficient cash flow to make the payments pursuant to the management services agreement, we may be unable to cover these expenses. As a member of NCM LLC, we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of NCM LLC. We have structured the NCM LLC senior secured credit facility and indentures to allow NCM LLC to distribute cash to its members (including us and NCM LLCs founding members) in amounts sufficient to cover their tax liabilities and management fees, if any. To the extent that NCM LLC has insufficient cash flow to make such payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. NCM LLCs substantial debt obligations could impair our financial condition or prevent us from achieving our business goals NCM LLC is party to substantial debt obligations. The senior secured credit facility and indentures contain restrictive covenants that limit NCM LLCs ability to take specified actions and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that NCM LLC must meet. Because NCM LLC is our only operating subsidiary, 29 Table of Contents complying with these restrictions may prevent NCM LLC from taking actions that we believe would help us to grow our business. For example, NCM LLC may be unable to make acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures as a result of such covenants. Moreover, if NCM LLC violates those restrictive covenants or fails to meet the minimum financial requirements, it would be in default, which could, in turn, result in defaults under other obligations of NCM LLC. Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity. For further information, see Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. If NCM LLC is unable to meet its debt service obligations, it could be forced to restructure or refinance the obligations, seek additional equity financing or sell assets. We may be unable to restructure or refinance these obligations, obtain additional equity financing, sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all or make quarterly dividend payments. In addition, NCM LLCs indebtedness could have other negative consequences for us, including without limitation:  limiting NCM LLCs ability to obtain financing in the future;  requiring much of NCM LLCs cash flow to be dedicated to interest obligations and making it unavailable for other purposes, including payments to its members (including NCM, Inc.) and making quarterly dividend payments;  limiting NCM LLCs liquidity and operational flexibility in changing economic, business and competitive conditions which could require NCM LLC to consider deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling assets, restructuring existing debt or deferring acquisitions or other strategic opportunities; and  making NCM LLC more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in our operating performance or decline in general economic conditions. Despite NCM LLCs current levels of debt, it or NCM, Inc. may still incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, which would increase the risks associated with NCM LLCs level of debt The agreements relating to NCM LLCs debt, including the Senior Unsecured Notes, Senior Secured Notes and the senior secured credit facility, limit but do not prohibit NCM LLCs ability to incur additional debt, and do not place any restrictions on NCM, Inc.s ability to incur debt. Accordingly, NCM, Inc. or NCM LLC could incur additional debt in the future, including additional debt under the senior secured credit facility, additional senior or senior subordinated notes and additional secured debt. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the related risks that we now face, including those described above under NCM LLCs substantial debt obligations could impair our financial condition or prevent us from achieving our business goals, could intensify. NCM LLCs founding members or their affiliates may have interests that differ from those of our public stockholders and they may be able to influence our affairs So long as an NCM LLC founding member beneficially owns at least 5% of NCM LLCs issued and outstanding common membership units, approval of at least 90% of the directors then in office (provided that if the board has less than ten directors, then the approval of at least 80% of the directors then in office) will be required before we may take any of the following actions or we, in our capacity as manager of NCM LLC, may authorize NCM LLC to take any of the following actions:  assign, transfer, sell or pledge all or a portion of the membership units of NCM LLC beneficially owned by NCM, Inc.;  acquire, dispose, lease or license assets with an aggregate value exceeding 20% of the fair market value of the business of NCM LLC operating as a going concern;  merge, reorganize, recapitalize, reclassify, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or enter into a similar transaction;  incur any funded indebtedness or repay, before due, any funded indebtedness with a fixed term in an aggregate amount in excess of $15.0 million per year; 30 Table of Contents  issue, grant or sell shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, preferred stock or rights with respect to common or preferred stock, or NCM LLC membership units or rights with respect to membership units, except under specified circumstances;  amend, modify, restate or repeal any provision of NCM, Inc.s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or the NCM LLC operating agreement;  enter into, modify or terminate certain material contracts not in the ordinary course of business as defined under applicable securities laws;  except as specifically set forth in the NCM LLC operating agreement, declare, set aside or pay any redemption of, or dividends with respect to membership interests;  amend any material terms or provisions (as defined in the NASDAQ rules) of NCM, Inc.s equity incentive plan or enter into any new equity incentive compensation plan;  make any change in the current business purpose of NCM, Inc. to serve solely as the manager of NCM LLC or any change in the current business purpose of NCM LLC to provide the services as set forth in the ESAs; and  approve any actions relating to NCM LLC that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse tax effect on NCM LLCs founding members. Pursuant to a director designation agreement, so long as an NCM LLC founding member owns at least 5% of NCM LLCs issued and outstanding common membership units, such NCM LLC founding member will have the right to designate a total of two nominees to our ten-member board of directors who will be voted upon by our stockholders. One such designee by each NCM LLC founding member must meet the independence requirements of the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. If, at any time, any NCM LLC founding member owns less than 5% of NCM LLCs then issued and outstanding common membership units, then such NCM LLC founding member shall cease to have any rights of designation. If any director designee to our board designated by NCM LLCs founding members is not appointed to our board, nominated by us or elected by our stockholders, as applicable, then each of NCM LLCs founding members (so long as such NCM LLC founding member continues to own 5% of NCM LLCs issued and outstanding common membership units) will be entitled to approve specified actions of NCM LLC. For purposes of calculating the 5% ownership threshold for the supermajority director approval rights and director designation agreement provisions discussed above, shares of our common stock held by a founding member and received upon redemption of NCM LLC common membership units will be counted toward the threshold. Common membership units issued to NCM, Inc. in connection with the redemption of common membership units by an NMC LLC founding member will be excluded, so long as such NCM LLC founding member continues to hold the common stock acquired through such redemption or such NCM LLC founding member has disposed of such shares of common stock to another NCM LLC founding member. Shares of our common stock otherwise acquired by NCM LLCs founding members will also be excluded, unless such shares of common stock were transferred by one NCM LLC founding member to another and were originally received by the transferring NCM LLC founding member upon redemption of NCM LLC common membership units. Under these circumstances, our corporate governance documents will allow NCM LLCs founding members and their affiliates to exercise a greater degree of influence in the operation of our business and that of NCM LLC and the management of our affairs and those of NCM LLC than is typically available to stockholders of a publicly-traded company. Even if NCM LLCs founding members or their affiliates own a minority economic interest (but not less than 5%) in NCM LLC, they may be able to continue exerting such degree of influence over us and NCM LLC. 31 Table of Contents Different interests among NCM LLCs founding members or between NCM LLCs founding members and us could prevent us from achieving our business goals For the foreseeable future, we expect that our board of directors will include directors and executive officers of NCM LLCs founding members and other directors who may have commercial or other relationships with NCM LLCs founding members. The majority of NCM LLCs outstanding membership interests also are owned by NCM LLCs founding members. NCM LLCs founding members compete with each other in the operation of their respective businesses and could have individual business interests that may conflict with those of the other founding members. Their differing interests could make it difficult for us to pursue strategic initiatives that require consensus among NCM LLCs founding members. In addition, the structural relationship we have with NCM LLCs founding members could create conflicts of interest among NCM LLCs founding members, or between NCM LLCs founding members and us, in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. There is not any formal dispute resolution procedure in place to resolve conflicts between us and an NCM LLC founding member or between NCM LLC founding members. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts between us and an NCM LLC founding member and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were negotiating with an unaffiliated party. The corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable NCM LLCs founding members to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to both NCM LLCs founding members and us. It provides that if a corporate opportunity is offered to us, NCM LLC or one or more of the officers, directors or stockholders (both direct and indirect) of NCM, Inc. or a member of NCM LLC that relates to the provision of services to motion picture theatres, use of theatres for any purpose, sale of advertising and promotional services in and around theatres and any other business related to the motion picture theatre business (except services as provided in the ESAs as from time to time amended and except as may be offered to one of our officers in his capacity as an officer), no such person shall be liable to us or any of our stockholders (or any affiliate thereof) for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to us. This provision applies even if the business opportunity is one that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and the NCM LLC operating agreement expressly provide that NCM LLCs founding members may have other business interests and may engage in any other businesses not specifically prohibited by the terms of the certificate of incorporation, including the exclusivity provisions of the ESAs. The parent companies of NCM LLCs founding members are not bound by the ESAs and therefore could develop new media platforms that could compete for advertising dollars with our services. Further, we may also compete with NCM LLCs founding members or their affiliates in the area of employee recruiting and retention. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by NCM LLCs founding members to themselves or their other affiliates or we lose key personnel to them. The agreements between us and NCM LLCs founding members were made in the context of an affiliated relationship and may contain different terms than comparable agreements with unaffiliated third parties The ESAs and the other contractual agreements made at the date of our IPO, that we have with NCM LLCs founding members were negotiated in the context of an affiliated relationship in which representatives of NCM LLCs founding members and their affiliates comprised our entire board of directors. As a result, the financial provisions and the other terms of these agreements, such as covenants, contractual obligations on our 32 Table of Contents part and on the part of NCM LLCs founding members and termination and default provisions may be less favorable to us than terms that we might have obtained in negotiations with unaffiliated third parties in similar circumstances. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover protections that may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the NCM LLC operating agreement, provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:  establish supermajority approval requirements by our directors before our board may take certain actions;  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;  establish a classified board of directors;  allow removal of directors only for cause;  prohibit stockholder action by written consent;  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates; and  provide that NCM LLCs founding members will be able to exercise a greater degree of influence over the operations of NCM LLC, which may discourage other nominations to our board of directors, if any director nominee designated by NCM LLCs founding members is not elected by our stockholders. These restrictions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of us or NCM LLC. Any future issuance of membership units by NCM LLC and subsequent redemption of such units for common stock could dilute the voting power of our existing common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock The common unit adjustment agreement and the ESAs provide that we will issue common membership units of NCM LLC to account for changes in the number of theatre screens NCM LLCs founding members operate and which are made part of our advertising network. Historically, each of NCM LLCs founding members has increased the number of screens it operates. If this trend continues, NCM LLC may issue additional common membership units to NCM LLCs founding members to reflect their increase in net screen count. Each common membership unit may be redeemed in exchange for, at our option, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to the market price of one share of our common stock. If a significant number of common membership units were issued to NCM LLCs founding members, NCM LLCs founding members elected to redeem such units, and we elected to issue common stock rather than cash upon redemption, the voting power of our common stockholders could be diluted. Other than the maximum number of authorized shares of common stock in our certificate of incorporation, there is no limit on the number of shares of our common stock that we may issue upon redemption of an NCM LLC founding members common membership units in NCM LLC. For further information, see Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. 33 Table of Contents Our future issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of our common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock The future issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock, either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock. The future issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock. If we or NCM LLCs founding members are determined to be an investment company, we would become subject to burdensome regulatory requirements and our business activities could be restricted We do not believe that we are an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As sole manager of NCM LLC, we control NCM LLC, and our interest in NCM LLC is not an investment security as that term is used in the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we were to stop participating in the management of NCM LLC, our interest in NCM LLC could be deemed an investment security for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Generally, a company is an investment company if it owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding U.S. government securities and cash items). Our sole material asset is our equity interest in NCM LLC. A determination that such asset was an investment security could result in our being considered an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, we would become subject to registration and other burdensome requirements of the Investment Company Act. In addition, the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 could restrict our business activities, including our ability to issue securities. We and NCM LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we are not deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if anything were to occur that would cause us to be deemed an investment company, we would become subject to restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act of 1940. These restrictions, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operations. We also rely on representations of NCM LLCs founding members that they are not investment companies under the Investment Company Act. If any NCM LLC founding member were deemed an investment company, the restrictions placed upon that NCM LLC founding member might inhibit its ability to fulfill its obligations under its ESA or restrict NCM LLCs ability to borrow funds. Our tax receivable agreement with NCM LLCs founding members is expected to reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available to us and will increase our potential exposure to the financial condition of NCM LLCs founding members Our initial public offering and related transactions have the effect of reducing the amounts NCM, Inc. would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities as a result of an increase in its proportionate share of tax basis in NCM LLCs tangible and intangible assets. We have agreed in our tax receivable agreement with NCM LLCs founding members to pay to NCM LLCs founding members 90% of the amount by which NCM, Inc.s 34 Table of Contents tax payments to various tax authorities are reduced as a result of the increase in tax basis. After paying these reduced amounts to tax authorities, if it is determined as a result of an income tax audit or examination that any amount of NCM, Inc.s claimed tax benefits should not have been available, NCM, Inc. may be required to pay additional taxes and possibly penalties and interest to one or more tax authorities. If this were to occur and if one or more of NCM LLCs founding members was insolvent or bankrupt or otherwise unable to make payment under its indemnification obligation under the tax receivable agreement, then NCM, Inc.s financial condition could be negatively impacted. NCM LLCs calendar year 2007 and 2008 tax returns are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is reasonably possible that, should the IRS prevail in its position in the audit, NCM, Inc. may be required to pay additional amounts to NCM LLCs founding members under the tax receivable agreement which would be offset by refunds from various state and federal taxing authorities. However, at this time the amount of any such payments to NCM LLCs founding members or refunds from the various taxing authorities cannot be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. The substantial number of shares that are eligible for sale could cause the market price for our common stock to decline or make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of common stock by NCM LLCs founding members will have on the market price of our common stock from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or make future offerings of our equity securities more difficult. If we are unable to sell equity securities at times and prices that we deem appropriate, we may be unable to fund growth. The founding members may receive up to 57,531,576 shares of common stock upon redemption of their outstanding common membership units of NCM LLC. The resale of these shares of common stock has been registered as required by the terms of the registration rights agreement between NCM Inc. and the NCM LLC founding members. Additionally, once options and restricted stock held by our employees become vested and/or exercisable, as applicable, to the extent that they are not held by one of our affiliates, the shares acquired upon vesting or exercise are freely tradeable.
