ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Statements in this Annual Report under the captions "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", as well as oral statements that may be made by us or by our officers, directors or employees acting on our behalf, that are not historical fact constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WITH NO OPERATING HISTORY AND, ACCORDINGLY, YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY BASIS ON WHICH TO EVALUATE OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. We will not generate any revenues (other than interest income on the cash held in trust) until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination. We cannot assure you as to when or if a business combination will occur. UNDER STATEPLACEDELAWARE LAW, THE REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION MAY BE AMENDED, WHICH COULD REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE PROTECTION AFFORDED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS BY SUCH REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS. Our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and other businesses. This could have a negative effect on our ability to consummate a business combination. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. All of our executive officers are engaged in several other business endeavors and are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours to our affairs. WE MAY ISSUE SHARES OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES TO COMPLETE A BUSINESS COMBINATION WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE EQUITY INTEREST OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND COULD LIKELY CAUSE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR OWNERSHIP. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. There will be 594,494,444 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock available for issuance and all of the 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, a combination of common and preferred stock, or debt securities, to complete a business combination. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock if the holders of our short term debt-due to shareholders exercise the conversion features as described in Note 4 to the financial statements. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or any number of shares of our preferred stock: * may significantly dilute the equity interest of our initial public offering investors; * may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if the preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock; * could likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and most likely also result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and 4 * may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Similarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in: * default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination were insufficient to service our debt obligations; * acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt security contains covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and any such covenant is breached without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; * our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and * our inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding. WE DEPEND ON OUR CURRENT MANAGEMENT TEAM, THE LOSS OF ANY MEMBER OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT CARRY KEY MAN LIFE INSURANCE AND HAVE NOT REQUIRED NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENTS. We depend on the services of management to meet our business development objectives. We would expect to encounter difficulty replacing any of them. The loss of any person on our management team, or the inability of one or more of them to devote sufficient attention to our operations, could materially adversely affect our business and operations. We have not entered into an employment or a non-competition agreement with any member of management. As a result, any such member may discontinue providing his services to us at any time and for any reason, and even thereafter commence competition with us. We do not carry key person life insurance for any member of our management team. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDUSTRY OF THE TARGET BUSINESS. We cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have experience or sufficient knowledge relating to the industry of the target business to make an appropriate acquisition decision. SOME OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE CURRENTLY, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME, AFFILIATED WITH ENTITIES ENGAGED IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE INTENDED TO BE CONDUCTED BY US AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN DETERMINING TO WHICH ENTITY A PARTICULAR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE PRESENTED. Some of our officers and directors are currently, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities, including other "blank check" companies, engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Additionally, our officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities to which they have fiduciary obligations. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. For a complete discussion of our management's business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, see the sections appearing elsewhere in this report entitled "Management - Directors and Officers" and "Management - Conflicts of Interest." We cannot assure you that these conflicts will be resolved in our favor. NONE OF OUR OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS HAVE EVER BEEN A PRINCIPAL OF, OR HAVE EVER BEEN AFFILIATED WITH, A COMPANY FORMED WITH A BUSINESS PURPOSE SIMILAR TO OURS. Our officers and directors have never served as officers or directors of a development stage public company with the business purpose of raising funds to acquire an operating business. Accordingly, you may not be able to adequately evaluate their ability to successfully consummate a business combination. 5 OUR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO EFFECT A BUSINESS COMBINATION USING OUR COMMON STOCK AS CONSIDERATION. To the extent we issue shares of common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of substantial numbers of additional shares upon exercise of these warrants and the option could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business as such securities, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and reduce the value of any shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, our warrants and the option may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of the target business. Additionally, the sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants and the option could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future public financing. If and to the extent these warrants and the option are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings. IF WE ARE DEEMED TO BE AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INSTITUTE BURDENSOME COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR ACTIVITIES MAY BE RESTRICTED, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPLETE A BUSINESS COMBINATION. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, our activities may be restricted, including: * restrictions on the nature of our investments; and * restrictions on the issuance of securities, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including: * registration as an investment company; * adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; * reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance and disclosure requirements; and * complying with other rules and regulations. We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act of 1940. To this end, the proceeds held in trust may only be invested by the trust agent in "government securities" (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940) with specific maturity dates. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we were deemed to be subject to the Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense that we have not allotted for. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2006 fiscal year and that remain unresolved.
