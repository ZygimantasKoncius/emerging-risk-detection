D. Risk Factors and Item 5.A. Operating ResultsEnergy Segment. Dividend Policy It is Mitsuis basic policy to declare dividends twice per year. The record date for year-end dividends is March 31 and the record date for interim dividends is September 30. For a discussion of dividend distribution provisions under the Companies Act of Japan and Mitsuis Articles of Incorporation, see Item 10.B. Memorandum and Articles of Association. In order to maximize shareholder value, we have sought to maintain an optimal balance between (1) achieving sustainable growth through strategic investments in areas of our core strength and growth and (2) paying out cash dividends as direct compensation to shareholders with the target dividend payout ratio of 20% of consolidated net income. For the year ended March 31, 2010, we paid an annual dividend of ¥18 per share including interim dividend of ¥7 per share, or ¥7 per share lower than the previous year, according to the target dividend pay out ratio of 20%. As a result, pay out ratio was 21.9%. When formulating the Medium-term Management Plan and vision for the next three to five years, we reviewed our shareholder return policy. In light of the current business circumstances, we forecast an improvement in earnings reflecting higher prices in commodity prices against a backdrop of high growth of the emerging economies and gradual but steady recovery of the world economy. To resolve the tight global supply of mineral resources and energy we believe that there will continue to be many opportunities to invest in expansion projects of the existing assets and will continue seeking new investment opportunities that may provide us a foundation for our future. At the same time, with a high level of uncertainty still surrounding financial markets as well as the global economy, we believe that it would also be for the benefit of shareholders in the medium- to long-term if we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet. At the same time, we recognize our shareholders are expecting a stable but high level of shareholder compensation. Accordingly, we would like to maintain the target dividend payout ratio of 20% of consolidated net income as a minimum. While we aim to steadily increase dividends from their current levels through improving the performance of the company, we will consider if we should compensate the shareholders in a flexible way provided that we secure the sufficient retained earnings for the future business development. For the year ending March 31, 2011, we intend to make a proposal based on the dividend policy outlined above upon reviewing the operating results. Based on the current earnings forecast of ¥320 billion for the year ending March 31, 2011, our annual dividend per share is calculated to be ¥36 per share, ¥18 per share higher than the previous year. We will continue to review the dividend policy taking into consideration the business environment, future trend of the investing activities, free cash flow level, interest bearing debt level and return on equity.

Share prices on Japanese stock exchanges are determined on a real-time basis by the equilibrium between bids and offers. These exchanges set daily price limits, which limit the maximum range of fluctuation within a single trading day. Daily price limits are set according to the previous days closing price or special quote. Although transactions may continue at the upward or downward limit price if the limit price is reached on a 190 Table of Contents particular trading day, no transactions may take place outside these limits. Consequently, an investor wishing to sell at a price above or below the relevant daily limit may not be able to sell his shares at such price on a particular trading day, or at all. On August 6, 2010, the closing sales price per share of our common stock on the TSE was ¥1,201, and the closing sales price per ADS on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was U.S.$280.31. B.
