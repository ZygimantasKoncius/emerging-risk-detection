Item 1A. Risk Factors contained herein for discussion regarding the potential for increased lending risks to which the Company may be subjected due to its increased emphasis on commercial and construction lending or any downturn in the real estate market. In the event of default, management believes that losses would be offset by funds received through the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral. Real estate and personal property acquired by the Company in settlement of loans is classified within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until such time that it is sold. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair market value less cost to sell at the date of acquisition with any resulting writedowns being taken through the Allowance. Fair market values of such property are reviewed regularly, and writedowns are recorded when it is determined that the carrying value of the property exceeds the fair market value less estimated costs to sell. Gains and losses on the sale of property acquired in settlement of loans and writedowns resulting from periodic reevaluation are charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income. Costs relating to the development and improvement of such property are capitalized within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs relating to holding the property are charged to expense within Other Noninterest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Generally, any interest accrual on such loans would have ceased when the loan became 90 days delinquent. Real estate acquired in settlement of loans decreased to $600 thousand at December 31, 2006 from $2.0 million at December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes the changes in the allowances, including the balance at the beginning and end of each period, provision charged to expense, and losses charged to the Allowance related to the Companys real estate acquired in settlement of loans for the periods indicated (in thousands). At and for the year endedDecember 31, 2006 2005 Real estate acquired in settlement of loans, beginning of period $ 1,954 2,413 Add: New real estate acquired in settlement of loans 294 1,096 Less: Sales / recoveries of real estate acquired in settlement of loans (1,451 ) (1,283 ) Less: Provision charged to expense (197 ) (272 ) Real estate acquired in settlement of loans, end of period $ 600 1,954 40 Table of Contents Management believes that the decrease in property added to the portfolio during 2006 was a direct reflection of economic conditions that directly impact the borrowers ability to service their debt. Relationships within the portfolio declined from 22 at December 31, 2005 to 13 at December 31, 2006. Based on the Companys policies and procedures regarding the regular review of fair market values of real estate acquired in settlement of loans and writedowns taken accordingly, management believes that the properties within the portfolio were properly valued at December 31, 2006. Additionally, management believes that the excess of sales from the portfolio during fiscal year 2006 over additions during the same timeframe indicate that the properties within the portfolio are marketable. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies with regard to real estate acquired in settlement of loans and Note 8 also contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys real estate acquired in settlement of loans portfolio. Management believes that because the Companys loan portfolio is closely monitored. Additionally, management believes that there will always remain a core level of delinquent loans and real estate and personal property acquired in settlement of loans from normal lending operations. Concentrations of Credit Risk. Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of loans, investment securities, federal funds sold and due from bank balances. The Company makes loans to individuals and small to medium-sized businesses for various personal and commercial purposes primarily in Upstate, South Carolina. The Companys loan portfolio is not concentrated in loans to any single borrower or a relatively small number of borrowers. Additionally, management is not aware of any concentrations of loans to classes of borrowers or industries that would be similarly impacted by economic conditions. Management has identified, and the following table summarizes at the dates indicated, concentrations of types of lending that it monitors (dollars in thousands). December 31, 2006 Outstandingbalance As apercentageof totalequity As apercentageof totalloans Loans secured by: Commercial and industrial nonmortgage instruments $ 126,742 126 % 13 % Residential mortgage instruments 171,828 171 18 Nonresidential mortgage instruments 540,869 539 57 December 31, 2005 Outstandingbalance As apercentageof totalequity As apercentageof totalloans Loans secured by: Commercial and industrial nonmortgage instruments $ 143,334 161 % 17 % Residential mortgage instruments 167,693 189 19 Nonresidential mortgage instruments 458,154 515 53 Loans secured by commercial and industrial nonmortgage instruments are typically of higher risk and are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrowers business. Such loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral types, including, but not limited to, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. 41 Table of Contents In addition to monitoring potential concentrations of loans to particular borrowers or groups of borrowers, industries, geographic regions, and loan types, management monitors whether or not the Company has exposure to credit risk from other lending practices such as loans that subject borrowers to substantial payment increases (e.g. principal deferral periods, loans with initial interest-only periods, etc.) and loans with high loan-to-value ratios. Management has determined that, at December 31, 2006, the Company has no concentrations in such loans, as the Company does not typically engage in such lending practices. Additionally, there are industry practices that could subject the Company to increased credit risk should economic conditions change over the course of a loans life. For example, the Company makes adjustable-rate loans and fixed-rate principal-amortizing loans with maturities prior to the loan being fully paid (i.e. balloon-term loans). These loans are underwritten and monitored to manage the associated risks. Therefore, management believes that these particular practices do not subject the Company to unusual credit risk. Allowance for Loan Losses In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determining the related provision for loan losses, if any, management may consider, though not intended to be an all-inclusive list, historical loss experience and change in the size and mix of the overall portfolio composition, specific allocations based on probable losses identified during the review of the portfolio, delinquency trends in the portfolio and the composition of nonperforming loans, including the percent of nonperforming loans with supplemental mortgage insurance or secured by real estate, and subjective factors, including local and general economic business factors and trends, industry and interest rate trends, new lending products, changes in underwriting criteria, and portfolio concentrations. Management is currently using a five year lookback period when computing historical loss rates to determine the allocated component of the Allowance. In addition to the Companys portfolio review process as noted in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLoans, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Companys allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. While the Company uses available information to recognize inherent losses on loans, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and other factors and the impact of such changes on the Banks borrowers. The adequacy of the Allowance is analyzed on a monthly basis using an internal analysis model. On a quarterly basis, the Companys Allowance model and conclusions are reviewed and approved by senior management. The Companys analysis of Allowance adequacy includes consideration for loan impairment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies with regard to the Allowance. The Allowance totaled $8.5 million and $8.4 million, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively representing 0.90% and 0.97% of loans, calculated using loans excluding mortgage loans held for sale, net of unearned income, excluding allowance for loan losses. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value. The fair market value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on prices for outstanding commitments to sell these loans. Typically, the carrying amount approximates fair market value due to the Companys practice of selling these loans within 60 days of origination. Likewise, such instruments are not included in the assumptions related to the Allowance model. 42 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the allocation of the Allowance and the percentage of loans to total loans, excluding net of unearned balances, both by collateral type, at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). Management believes that the Allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the Allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the Allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFinancial ConditionLoans contained herein for discussion regarding the composition of the loan portfolio as well as the fluctuations within the portfolio from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2006. The primary increases with regard to the allocation of the Allowance to specific loan portfolios at December 31, 2005 were within the portfolios secured by other real estate and general consumer collateral. The increase in allocation of the Allowance to the portfolio secured by other real estate was due, in large part, to two impaired loans at December 31, 2005, as discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLoans, both of which were secured by other real estate. As such, the loans were classified as substandard in accordance with the Banks Lending Policy. The loans impaired statuses increased the related Allowance coverage. At December 31, 2005, the principal balance of these loans totaled $7.2 million. The increase in allocation of the Allowance to the loan portfolio secured by general consumer collateral was due, in part, to the increase in the indirect lending portfolio at December 31, 2005 over December 31, 2004 as well as an increase in the potential historical loss percentage with regard to this category. 43 Table of Contents The following table summarizes activity within the Allowance at the dates and for the years indicated (dollars in thousands). Losses and recoveries are charged or credited to the Allowance at the time realized. At and for the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Allowance balance, beginning of year $ 8,431 7,619 7,463 6,402 5,658 Provision for loan losses 1,625 2,400 2,150 3,600 4,288 Loans charged-off Commercial and industrial 453 244 549 786 1,074 Real estate1 - 4 family 247 415 232 561 398 Real estateconstruction      Real estateother 191 242 256 219  Consumer 791 891 1,113 1,181 2,298 Total loans charged-off 1,682 1,792 2,150 2,747 3,770 Recoveries Commercial and industrial 37 35 49 32 105 Real estate1 - 4 family 15    9 Real estateconstruction      Real estateother 6 35 4 46  Consumer 95 134 103 130 112 Total recoveries 153 204 156 208 226 Net loans charged-off 1,529 1,588 1,994 2,539 3,544 Allowance balance, end of year $ 8,527 8,431 7,619 7,463 6,402 Average loans (1) $ 895,062 828,545 725,555 659,683 577,949 Ending loans (1) 945,913 866,181 773,254 693,213 625,542 Net loans charged-offs to average loans (1) 0.17 % 0.19 0.27 0.38 0.61 Allowance for loan losses to ending loans (1) 0.90 0.97 0.99 1.08 1.02 (1) Calculated using loans excluding mortgage loans held for sale, net of unearned income, excluding allowance for loan losses See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEarnings ReviewProvision for Loan Losses contained herein for discussion regarding the decrease in the provision for loan losses from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2006. Total net loans charged-off totaled $1.5 million in fiscal year 2006 down from $1.6 million in fiscal year 2005. When comparing net loans charged-off during fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006, declines were experienced in all portfolios with the exception of the portfolio secured by commercial and industrial collateral. Although management attributes the decline in net loans charged-off to the careful management of the Companys loan portfolio, management believes that the increase in net loans charged-off within the portfolio secured by commercial and industrial collateral was caused by risk factors as explained in See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLoans. The level of the Allowance during fiscal year 2006 was also impacted by growth within the loan portfolio during the period. Management believes that the declining trend of the Allowance to ending loans results from several factors including, but not limited to, managements conservative philosophy regarding its lending mix which impacts risk grades assigned at loan origination, the ongoing management of asset quality, and growth within the portfolio being primarily loans secured by real estate which generally involve less risk that other types of lending, all of which impact Allowance allocations. 44 Table of Contents Based on the current economic environment and other factors that impact the assessment of the Companys Allowance as discussed above, management believes that the Allowance at December 31, 2006 was maintained at a level adequate to provide for estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLoans contained herein for discussion regarding factors inherent in the loan portfolio impacting managements December 31, 2006 assessment of the Allowance. However, assessing the adequacy of the Allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment. Managements judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events believed to be reasonable but which may or may not be valid. Thus, there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current Allowance or that future increases in the Allowance will not be required. No assurance can be given that managements ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio, in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances, will not require future additions to the Allowance, thus adversely impacting the results of operations of the Company. Deposits Retail deposit accounts have traditionally been the primary source of funds for the Company and also provide a customer base for the sale of additional financial products and services. The Company sets targets for growth in traditional deposit accounts annually in an effort to cross sell and increase the number of products per banking relationship. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company emphasized the growth of traditional deposit accounts through internal and external referral programs and targeted promotions. The Company offers a number of traditional deposit accounts including noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, savings, money market, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and certificate of deposit accounts. The Companys deposits are obtained primarily from residents within its market area. The Company experiences fluctuations in deposit flows because of the influence of general interest rates, market conditions, and competitive factors. The AssetLiability Committee meets weekly and makes changes to the mix, maturity, and pricing of assets and liabilities in an effort to minimize the impact on operations from such external conditions. Deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and generally low cost, as compared to other funding sources, and their ability to provide fee income through service charges and cross sales of other services. The Company provides customers with access to their funds using the convenience of an ATM network that incorporates regional and national ATM networks. At December 31, 2006, the Bank had 38 ATM locations (including eight at nonbanking offices) and five limited service banking offices located in various Upstate retirement centers. The Company also provides account access through its Internet and telephone banking products and attracts deposit customers by offering a variety of services and accounts, competitive interest rates, and conveniences such as extended banking office hours, both early and late, all-day deposit credit, and Saturday banking hours. In addition, the Company uses traditional marketing techniques, such as direct mailings and advertising, to attract new customers. Management believes the Company enjoys an excellent reputation for providing products and services that meet the needs of all of the Companys market segments. For example, Seniority Club members benefit from a number of advantageous programs. 45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Companys deposit composition at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Total % of Total Total % of Total Total % of Total Total % of Total Total % of Total Noninterest-bearing transaction deposit accounts $ 133,623 13.4 % 131,157 14.5 124,489 15.0 115,982 15.0 114,573 15.9 Interest-bearing transaction deposit accounts 313,613 31.6 220,472 24.4 185,072 22.4 172,766 22.4 156,665 21.7 Transaction deposit accounts 447,236 45.0 351,629 38.9 309,561 37.4 288,748 37.4 271,238 37.6 Money market deposit accounts 124,874 12.6 111,380 12.3 95,608 11.6 85,077 11.0 79,553 11.0 Savings deposit accounts 41,887 4.2 45,360 5.0 44,972 5.4 41,974 5.5 37,807 5.2 Time deposit accounts 379,584 38.2 395,014 43.8 377,306 45.6 355,949 46.1 333,393 46.2 Total traditional deposit accounts $ 993,581 100.0 % 903,383 100.0 827,447 100.0 771,748 100.0 721,991 100.0 Total traditional deposit accounts increased $90.2 million from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006, up from growth of $75.9 million from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. Core traditional deposit accounts, which include checking, money market, and savings accounts, grew by $105.6 million during fiscal year 2006, or 20.8%. Such accounts grew by $58.2 million, or 12.9%, during fiscal year 2005. The increase in core traditional deposit accounts during both of these periods was primarily a result of the Companys continued ability to attract deposits through pricing adjustments, expansion of its geographic market area, level of quality customer service, and through the Companys reputation in the communities served. Additionally, the Company has made efforts to enhance its deposit mix by working to attract lower cost deposit accounts. The Company believes that the growth in core traditional deposit accounts from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2006 was enhanced by the introduction, continuation, and enhancement of programs and promotions, such as the Seniority Club checking product, a health savings account product, and new business investment money market account, as well as by branch opening promotions and the Banks new customer referral program. In addition, the Company believes that some of the growth within core traditional deposit accounts resulted from additional marketing efforts geared toward the Banks existing Palmetto Index Account which has become more attractive to customers as rates have risen since 2004 as well as growth in health savings accounts which was introduced during the fourth quarter of 2005 to help individuals save for future qualified medical and retiree health expenses on a tax-free basis in an effort to address the underlying problem of the affordability of health care coverage. The Company introduced its Health Savings transaction deposit account during the fourth quarter of 2005. This product was designed to assist customers and their families with the payment or reimbursement of qualified medical expenses. Contributions, although limited, and distributions to and from this account are tax-free provided they such are used for qualified medical expenses. Contributing to the growth in money market deposit accounts during 2006 was a deposit of approximately $14 million from one entity and an increase in money market funds by the Banks trust department of approximately $6 million during the period, offset somewhat by cash outflows during 2006. Time deposit accounts decreased by $15.4 million, or 3.9% during fiscal year 2006 compared with growth of $17.7 million, or 4.7% during fiscal year 2005. 36-month Step Up certificate of deposit promotions were 46 Table of Contents offered during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004. Promotional certificate of deposit accounts offered during 2003 matured during 2006. The Bank offered several specifically targeted programs, as described below, in an effort to retain maturing funds and successfully retained a large portion of these maturing funds. The decline in time deposit accounts during this period is due in large part to the funds that the Bank was unable to retain and the maturing funds that were reinvested by customers into difference Bank deposit products.  36-month Step Up certificate of deposit promotions were offered during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004. Certificate of deposit accounts generated through the 2004 promotion are scheduled to mature during 2007.  15 month certificate of deposit accounts offered by the Bank during December 2005 are scheduled to mature during 2007.  15 month certificate of deposit accounts offered by the Bank in conjunction with the opening of the new Boiling Springs banking office during the second half of 2006 are scheduled to mature during 2007.  13 month certificate of deposit accounts offered by the Bank during June and July 2006 in an effort to retain maturing funds at the Easley banking office opened in 2005 are scheduled to mature during 2007.  13 month certificate of deposit accounts offered by the Bank during July, August, and September 2006 in an effort to retain maturing funds at the Travelers Rest banking office are scheduled to mature during 2007. Additionally, 12 month certificate of deposit accounts offered by the Bank during June 2006 at this banking office in an effort to stimulate new deposit account growth are scheduled to mature during 2007.  12 month certificate of deposit accounts offered by the Bank during July, August, and September 2006 in an effort to retain maturing funds at the Easley and Travelers Rest banking offices are scheduled to mature during 2007. The table set forth below summarizes the Companys weighted average deposit costs for the periods indicated. For the year endedDecember 31, 2006 For the year endedDecember 31, 2005 Average cost of core deposit accounts 2.20 % 0.94 Average cost of time deposit accounts 3.98 2.99 Average cost of total traditional deposit accounts 3.04 1.98 The table set forth below summarizes the Companys interest expense on deposit accounts costs for the periods indicated (in thousands).

At December 31, 2006, traditional deposit accounts as a percentage of liabilities were 94.4% compared with 91.6% at December 31, 2005. The percentage of funding provided by traditional deposit accounts increased during 2006, and accordingly, the Company has not had to rely as heavily on alternative funding sources from which to fund a portion of loan demand. 47 Table of Contents Jumbo Certificates of Deposits. The Company does not rely significantly on large denomination certificate of deposit accounts. Such accounts totaled 12.3% and 12.5% of total liabilities at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. The following table summarizes the Companys jumbo certificate of deposit accounts by time remaining until contractual maturity at December 31, 2006 (in thousands). Jumbo certificate of deposit accounts include those accounts with year-end balances totaling $100,000 or greater. Three months or less $ 32,122 Over three months through six months 33,788 Over six months through twelve months 35,987 Twelve months or less 101,897 Over twelve months 27,285 Total jumbo certificate of deposit accounts $ 129,182 Total jumbo certificate of deposit accounts totaled $123.0 million at December 31, 2005. Although total jumbo certificate of deposit accounts experienced little change from December 31, 2005 to December 31,2006, a shift was experienced with regard to the maturity of such certificate of deposit accounts. At December 31, 2005, 53.0% of jumbo certificate of deposit accounts were to mature within twelve months. At December 31, 2006, 78.9% of jumbo certificate of deposit accounts were to mature within twelve months. Specifically targeted programs offered by the Bank to stimulate new deposit account growth and to retain existing but maturing funds, as previously discussed, contributed to the increase in the twelve months or less category. Although all of the deposits generated by these promotions are not jumbo in size, the deposits that do fall into the jumbo category impact the maturities noted above. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys deposit accounts. Borrowings In addition to traditional deposit accounts, the Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowing to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to assist in meeting deposit withdrawal requirements, and to fund growth of interest-earning assets in excess of traditional deposit growth. Retail repurchase agreements, commercial paper, federal funds purchased, and FHLB borrowings serve as the Companys primary sources of such funds. Borrowings decreased $24.1 million at the end of 2006 when compared with the end of 2005. Borrowings as a percentage of total liabilities were approximately 4.9% and 7.7% at the end of fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2005, respectively. The following table summarizes the Companys borrowings composition at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Total % of Total Total % of Total Retail repurchase agreements $ 14,427 28.1 % 16,728 22.1 Commercial paper 20,988 40.8 17,915 23.7 Federal funds purchased 6,000 11.7 1,000 1.3 FHLB borrowingsshortterm   16,900 22.4 FHLB borrowingslongterm 10,000 19.4 23,000 30.5 Total borrowings $ 51,415 100.0 % 75,543 100.0 Short-term and long-term borrowings are a source of funding that the Company utilizes depending on the current level of deposits, the desirability of raising deposits through market promotions, the Companys unused FHLB borrowing capacity, and the availability of collateral to secure FHLB borrowings. Long-term borrowings have maturities greater than one year when made. 48 Table of Contents The Company offers commercial paper as an alternative investment tool for its commercial customers. Through a master note arrangement between the holding company and the Bank, Palmetto Master Notes are issued as an alternative investment for commercial sweep accounts. These master notes are unsecured but are backed by the full faith and credit of the holding company. The commercial paper is issued only in conjunction with the automated sweep account customer agreement on deposits at the Bank level. Federal funds purchased represent unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions. These borrowings are an important source of funding to the Company. Access to such short-term funding sources allows the Company to meet funding needs without relying on increasing deposits on a short-term basis. Interest rates on such borrowings vary from time to time in response to general economic conditions. FHLB borrowings are an alternative to other funding sources with similar maturities. The FHLB has established an overall credit limit for each member. This limit is designed to mitigate the FHLBs credit exposure to an individual member while encouraging members to diversify their funding sources. Generally, this credit limit is 40 percent of the members total assets. However, a members eligibility to borrow in excess of 30 percent of assets is subject to its meeting eligibility criteria. Under certain circumstances, a member approved for a 40 percent credit limit may request approval to exceed the credit limit. A member may exceed the 40 percent limit for a period not to exceed 12 months. This policy serves to define an upper limit for FHLB advances based on its current approved limit. Qualifying collateral to be pledged to secure advances from the FHLB may include qualifying securities, loans, deposits, and stock of the FHLB owned by the Company. The member has certain obligations to the FHLB for its pledged collateral. These obligations include periodic reporting on eligible, pledged collateral and adherence to the FHLBs collateral verification review procedures. At December 31, 2006, of its approximately $103 million available credit based on qualifying loans to serve as collateral against short-term or long-term borrowings from the FHLB, the Company employed $10.0 million in borrowings, all of which was determined to be long-term when employed and employed $79.0 million in a letter of credit. FHLB letters of credit provide an attractive alternative to using traditional collateral for various transactions. Advantages of FHLB letters of credit include enhancing member liquidity (substituting letter of credit for securities as collateralization of public unit deposits) and utilization of residential mortgage loans as collateral for the letters of credit. However, the utilization of FHLB letters of credit reduces the Companys available credit based on qualifying loans to serve as collateral. The Company uses the FHLB letter of credit for collateralization of public deposits. The FHLB may assess fees and charges to cover costs relating to the receipt, holding, redelivery, and reassignment of the Companys collateral. The FHLB publishes a schedule of such fees and charges on its website. In addition, the FHLB may assess fees to cover collateral verification reviews performed by, or on behalf of, the FHLB. The Company has not yet been charged any such fees and does not anticipate such fees, if assessed, will be significant. Any FHLB advance with a fixed interest rate is subject to a prepayment fee in the event of full or partial repayment prior to maturity or the expiration of any interim interest rate period. Management was not aware of any circumstances at December 31, 2006 that would require prepayment of any of the Companys FHLB advances. 49 Table of Contents The following table summarizes short-term borrowing information at and for the years indicated (dollars in thousands).

The primary reason for the changes in the yields paid on interest-bearing liabilities has been the action of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee. Since the second quarter of 2004, the federal funds rate has increased from 1.0% to 5.25% in a series of seventeen moves. The increases in the Companys borrowings costs from the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2006 is attributed to these increasing rate trends. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies with regard to FHLB borrowings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10 and Note 11 also contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys borrowings. Capital Resources Average shareholders equity was $95.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, or 8.5% of average assets. Average shareholders equity was $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, or 8.2% of average assets. Total shareholders equity increased from $88.9 million at December 31, 2005 to $100.4 million at December 31, 2006. The Companys capital ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets was 8.7% at December 31, 2005 compared with 8.3% at December 31, 2005. During 2006, shareholders equity was increased through the retention of net income, stock option activity, compensation expense related to stock options granted and a slight increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. These increases were offset by an increase in cash dividends when comparing the year ended December 31, 2006 with the year ended December 31, 2005. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders Equity and Comprehensive Income contained herein for further discussion regarding the changes in stockholders equity during the years presented. The Company and the Bank are required to meet regulatory capital requirements that currently include several measures of capital. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company and the Bank were each categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective regulatory action. See Item 1. BusinessSupervision and Regulation and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19 all contained herein for further discussion regarding the Banks and the Companys capital 51 Table of Contents regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2006, there were no conditions or events of which management was aware that would materially change the Companys or the Banks status. During fiscal year 2006, the Companys cash dividend payout ratio was 30.45% compared with a payout ratio of 30.27% in 2005. Cash dividends per common share in 2006 totaled $0.73, an increase of 10.6% over dividends per common share in 2005 of $0.66. The amount of the dividends declared is dependent upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, capital position, and such other factors the Board deems relevant. South Carolina regulations restrict the amount of dividends that the Bank can pay to the holding company and may require prior approval before declaration and payment of any excess dividend.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 and Note 19 all contained herein for further discussion regarding common stock dividend payment determination and restrictions. Management continually reviews opportunities for Upstate expansion that are believed to be in the best interest of the Company, its customers, and its shareholders. During 2006, the Bank began an expansion of its Greenwood county Montague banking office. Construction on this office is anticipated to be completed during the first quarter of 2007. Additionally, during February 2007, the Bank purchased real estate in Anderson County and plans to relocate its existing Pendleton banking office to that site. The Company is currently considering land options with regard to its anticipated Greer banking office relocation. In conjunction with the Companys 100th anniversary celebration on September 21st, the Company announced its plan to relocate its corporate headquarters to downtown Greenville in 2008. Tentative plans project construction of the new leased facility to begin in 2007 with a projected completion date in 2008. Management is currently in negotiations of a build-to-suit ground and building lease with the property owner. The 42,000 square foot, classical bank design will be located at the corner of East North and Church Streets. Additionally, the Company anticipates that furniture and equipment for the new corporate headquarters facility will cost the Company an estimated $2.0 million. During the construction of its new corporate headquarters, the Company will temporarily move its East North Street banking office to a building owned by the Company located directly next to the permanent building site at 105 North Church Street. The Company anticipates that it will incur costs of approximately $350 thousand to upfit the building, and lease various banking office equipment, additional office spaces, and employee parking. Disclosures Regarding Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. The Companys market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure. The Company does not have any market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes. Interest rate sensitivity is managed by matching the repricing opportunities on interest-earning assets to those on interest-bearing liabilities. Management uses various assetliability strategies to manage the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within the Companys guidelines of acceptable levels of risk taking. Interest rate risk is addressed by the Companys AssetLiability Committee, which is comprised of certain members of senior management and a holding company board member. This committee monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact on net interest income from potential changes in interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure. The committee also manages the Companys balance sheet, in part, to maintain the potential impact on net interest income within acceptable ranges despite changes in interest rate. 52 Table of Contents The Companys exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the Companys AssetLiability Committee and Board of Directors. Interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates. If potential changes to net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the Companys guidelines, the Board may direct management to adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within such guidelines. Current guidelines of the Companys AssetLiability Committee include maintaining the projected negative impact on the Companys net interest income for the coming twelve month period at an amount not to exceed 20%. Management adjusts the Companys interest rate risk exposure position primarily through decisions on the pricing, maturity, and marketing of particular deposit and loan products and through decisions regarding the structure and maturities of FHLB advances and other borrowings. Market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as derivatives and other financial instruments. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company had not used any derivatives to alter its interest rate risk profile. The Companys financial instruments include loans, federal funds sold, FHLB stock, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings. At December 31, 2006, the Companys interest-sensitive assets totaled approximately $1.0 billion while interest-sensitive liabilities totaled approximately $879.5 million. At December 31, 2005, the Companys interest-sensitive assets totaled approximately $977.7 million while interest-sensitive liabilities totaled approximately $822.5 million. The yield on interest-sensitive assets and the cost of interest-sensitive liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 7.33% and 3.10%, respectively, compared to 6.42% and 2.10%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in the yield on interest-sensitive assets and the cost of interest-sensitive liabilities resulted from the rising interest rate environment. The Company evaluated the results of its net interest income simulation prepared as of December 31, 2006 for interest rate risk management purposes. Overall, the model results indicate that the Companys interest rate risk sensitivity is within limits set by the Companys guidelines and the Companys balance sheet is liability sensitive. A liability sensitive balance sheet suggests that in falling interest rate environment, net interest margin would increase and during an increasing interest rate environment, net interest margin would decrease. Net Interest Income Simulation In order to measure interest rate risk, the Company uses a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecasted changes in interest rates. This analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario and a net interest income forecast using a base market interest rate derived from the current treasury yield curve. The income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the repricing relationships for each of the Companys products. Many of the Companys assets are floating rate loans, which are assumed to reprice immediately, and to the same extent as the change in market rates according to contracted indexes. Some loans and investment securities include the opportunity of prepayment, and, accordingly, the simulation model uses national indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields. The Companys nonterm deposit products reprice more slowly, usually changing less than the change in market rates and at the Companys discretion. This analysis summarizes the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions. It assumes growth in the balance sheet. It does not account for all factors that impact this analysis, including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to the Companys credit risk profile as interest rates change. Furthermore, loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly. Interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis. Changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on net interest income. 53 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, the following table summarizes forecasted net interest income and net interest margin using a base market rate and the estimated change to the base scenario given upward and downward movement in interest rates of 100 basis points and 200 basis points (dollars in thousands). Interest rate scenario Adjusted netinterestincome Percentagechangefrom base Net interestmargin Net interestmarginchange (inbasis points) Up 200 basis points $ 49,776 (7.57 )% 4.51 % (0.37 ) Up 100 basis points 51,834 (3.75 ) 4.70 (0.18 ) BASE CASE 53,854  4.88  Down 100 basis points 55,602 3.25 5.04 0.16 Down 200 basis points 57,250 6.31 5.19 0.31 The simulation results as of December 31, 2006 indicate the Companys interest rate risk position was liability sensitive as the simulated impact of an downward movement in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in a 3.25% increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12 month period while an upward movement in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in a 3.75% decrease in net interest income over the next 12 months. The simulation results indicate that a 100 basis point downward shift in interest rates would result in a 16 basis point increase in net interest margin, assuming all other variables remained unchanged. Conversely, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would cause a 18 basis point decrease in net interest margin. The projected negative impact on the Companys net interest income for the twelve month period does not exceed the 20% threshold prescribed by the Asset  Liability Committees policy. Liquidity General The term liquidity refers to the ability of the Company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its operating needs. Management determines the desired level of liquidity for the Company in conjunction with the Companys Asset-Liability Committee. Liquidity management ensures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals, fund loan and capital expenditure commitments, maintain reserve requirements, pay operating expenses, provide funds for dividends and debt service, manage operations on an ongoing basis, and capitalize on new business opportunities. Funds are primarily provided by the Bank through customers deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, loan sales, sales of securities available for sale, maturities and paydowns of securities, and earnings. Securities classified as available for sale, which are not pledged, may be sold in response to changes in interest rates or liquidity needs. Approximately 62% of the investment securities portfolio was pledged to secure public deposits as of December 31, 2006 as compared with 83% at December 31, 2005. Of the Companys $116.6 million available for sale investment securities balance at December 31, $44.7 million was available as a liquidity source. The decline in pledged securities between these periods was the result of a diversification of assets pledged to secure public deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and for other purposes as required or permitted by law as noted below with regard to the FHLB line of credit. Management believes that cash flows from investments, in addition to its available borrowing capacity and efforts to grow deposits, are sufficient to provide the necessary funding for 2007. In managing its liquidity needs, the Company focuses on its existing assets and liabilities, as well as its ability to enter into additional borrowings, and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet its needs. The following table summarizes future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands). The table does not include estimated 2007 funding of the pension and other postretirement benefits plans. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys postretirement benefits. The table does not include payments required for interest and income taxes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained herein for further discussion regarding interest and income taxes paid during 2006. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period December 31, 2006 Withinone year Over oneto twoyears Over twoto threeyears Over threeto fiveyears Over fiveyears Total Time deposits $ 300,776 56,133 18,065 4,309 301 379,584 Federal funds purchased 6,000     6,000 FHLB borrowingslongterm 10,000     10,000 Real property operating leases 743 614 467 345 31 2,200 Total future contractual obligations $ 317,519 56,747 18,532 4,654 332 397,784 Net cash provided by operations and deposits from customers have been the primary sources of liquidity for the Company. Competition for deposits is intense in the markets served by the Company. However, the Company has been able to attract deposits through pricing adjustments, expansion of its geographic market area, level of quality customer service, and through the Companys reputation in the communities served. The Company maximizes its liquidity provided through acquiring new deposits through the Banks established branch network and placing less reliance on borrowings. The Company believes its deposit base is diversified with no one deposit or type of customer accounting for a significant portion of the portfolio. Liquidity needs are a factor in developing deposit pricing structure, which may be altered to retain or grow deposits if deemed necessary. Each of the Companys sources of liquidity is subject to various uncertainties beyond the control of the Company. As a measure of protection, additional funding sources have been arranged through federal funds lines at correspondent banks, through the Federal Reserve Discount Window, and through the FHLB. FHLB borrowings are an alternative to other funding sources with similar maturities. At December 31, 2006, of its approximately $103 million available credit based on qualifying loans to serve as collateral against short-term or long-term borrowings from the FHLB, the Company employed $10.0 million in borrowings, all of which was determined to be long-term when employed, and employed $79.0 million in a letter of credit used to secure public deposits as required or permitted by law. At December 31, 2006, the Company had additional funding sources totaling $34 million that were accessible at the Companys option. The Bank enters into agreements, in the normal course of business, to extend credit to meet the financial needs of its customers. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements for further discussion regarding such agreements. Increased demand for funds under these agreements would reduce the Companys available liquidity and could require additional sources of liquidity. As discussed above in Capital Resources, the Company will relocate its corporate headquarters to downtown Greenville in 2008. Management is currently in negotiations of a build-to-suit ground and building lease for the new corporate headquarters. As such, the real property operating lease obligations in the preceding table include the Companys obligations under its current lease with regard to its East North Street banking office. No real property operating lease obligations related to the new corporate headquarters are included in the preceding table due to the fact that the Company is currently in negotiations with regards to such obligations. Additionally, real property operating lease obligations summarized in the preceding table are net of payments to be received under a sublease agreement with a third party with regard to the Companys previous Blackstock Road banking office location. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFinancial ConditionBorrowings for further discussion regarding the Companys borrowings, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies with regard to FHLB borrowings, and Note 10 and Note 11 also contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys borrowings. 55 Table of Contents See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow contained herein to review factors that impacted liquidity during the years presented. Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowing to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to assist in meeting deposit withdrawal requirements, and to fund growth of interest-earning assets in excess of traditional deposit growth. Retail repurchase agreements, commercial paper, federal funds purchased, and FHLB borrowings serve as the Companys primary sources of such funds. Typically, the Companys retail repurchase agreements, commercial paper, federal funds purchased, and short-term FHLB borrowings represent overnight borrowings that mature daily. As such, these borrowings are not included in the contractual obligations table previously presented. Of the $23.0 million in long-term FHLB borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2005, $13.0 million matured during June 2006 leaving a remaining balance of $10.0 million in long-term borrowings with the FHLB at December 31, 2006. See Item 7.

Lease Agreements Obligations under noncancelable real property operating lease agreements are payable over several years with the longest obligation expiring in 2029. Contractual obligations relative to these agreements are noted in the table above. Option periods that the Company has not yet exercised are not included in this analysis as they do not represent contractual obligations of the Company until exercised. See
