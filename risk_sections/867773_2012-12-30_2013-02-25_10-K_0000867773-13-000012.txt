ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including risks related to our sales channels, liquidity, supply chain, operations, intellectual property, and our debt and equity securities. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below certain key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and trading price of our common stock as well as our 4.50% senior convertible debentures, 4.75% senior convertible debentures, and 0.75% senior convertible debentures.Risks Related to Our Sales Channels The increase in the global supply of solar cells and panels, and increasing competition, may cause substantial downward pressure on the prices of such products and cause us to lose sales or market share, resulting in lower revenues, earnings, and cash flow. Global solar cell and panel production capacity has been materially increasing since 2009, and solar cell and solar panel manufacturers continue to have significant excess capacity, particularly in China. Excess capacity and industry competition have resulted, and will continue to result, in substantial downward pressure on the price of solar cells and panels, including SunPower products. Increasing competition could also result in us losing sales or market share. Such price reductions or loss of sales or market share could continue to have a negative impact on our revenue and earnings, and could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and cash flows. In addition, our internal forecasts of pricing may not be accurate in the current market environment, which could cause our financial results to be different than forecasted. See also "If we fail to successfully execute our cost reduction roadmap, and develop and introduce new and enhanced products and services, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenues will suffer." Our operating results will be subject to fluctuations and are inherently unpredictable. We do not know if our revenue will grow, or if it will grow sufficiently to outpace our expenses. We may not be profitable on a quarterly basis. For example, we experienced net losses in each quarter of 2012. Our quarterly revenue and operating results will be difficult to predict and have in the past fluctuated from quarter to quarter. Revenue from our large commercial and, utilities and power plant customers (for example, our California Valley Solar Ranch ("CVSR") project and our Antelope Valley Solar Projects (“AVSP”)) is susceptible to large fluctuations. The amount, timing and mix of sales to our large commercial and utilities and power plant customers, often for a single medium or large-scale project, may cause large fluctuations in our revenue and other financial results as, at any given time, a single large-scale project can account for a material portion of our total revenue in a given quarter. Our inability to monetize our projects as planned, or any delay in obtaining the required government support or initial payments to begin recognizing revenue under the relevant recognition criteria, and the corresponding revenue impact under the percentage-of-completion method of recognizing revenue, may similarly cause large fluctuations in our revenue and other financial results. A delayed disposition of a project could require us to recognize a gain on the sale of assets instead of recognizing revenue. Further, our revenue mix of materials sales versus project sales can fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter, which may adversely affect our margins and financial results in any given period. Any decrease in revenue from our large commercial, utilities and power plant customers, whether due to a loss or delay of projects or an inability to collect, could have a significant negative impact on our business. Our agreements with these customers may be canceled if we fail to meet certain product specifications or materially breach the agreement. In the event of a customer bankruptcy, our customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. In addition, the failure by any significant customer to pay for orders, whether due to liquidity issues or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Sales to our residential and light commercial customers are similarly susceptible to fluctuations in volumes and revenues. Declining average selling prices immediately impact our residential and light commercial sales volumes, and therefore lead to large fluctuations in revenues. Any of the foregoing may cause us to miss any current and future revenue or earnings guidance and negatively impact liquidity. We base our planned operating expenses in part on our expectations of future revenue and a significant portion of our expenses is fixed in the short term. If revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect, we likely will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter, which would harm our operating results for that quarter. This may cause us to miss any earnings guidance announced by us. The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements for our solar power plants, our residential lease program and our customers, and is affected by general economic conditions. 17Table of ContentsThe general economy, the current European debt crisis, and limited availability of credit and liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We often require project financing for development and construction of our solar power plant projects, which require significant investments before the equity is later sold to investors. Many purchasers of our systems projects have entered into third-party arrangements to finance their systems over an extended period of time, while many end-customers have chosen to purchase solar electricity under a power purchase agreement ("PPA") with an investor or financing company that purchases the system from us or our authorized dealers. In addition, under our power purchase business model, we often execute PPAs directly with the end-user customer purchasing solar electricity, with the expectation that we will later assign the PPA to a financier. Under such arrangements, the financier separately contracts with us to build and acquire the solar power system, and then sells the electricity to the end-user customer under the assigned PPA. When executing PPAs with the end-user customers, we seek to mitigate the risk that a financier will not be available for the project by allowing termination of the PPA in such event without penalty. However, we may not always be successful in negotiating for penalty-free termination rights for failure to obtain financing, and certain end-user customers have required substantial financial penalties in exchange for such rights. These structured finance arrangements are complex and may not be feasible in many situations. Due to the general challenging credit markets worldwide, we may be unable to obtain project financing for our projects, customers may be unable or unwilling to finance the cost of our products, we may have difficulties in reaching agreements with financiers to finance the construction of our solar power systems, or the parties that have historically provided this financing may cease to do so, or only do so on terms that are substantially less favorable for us or our customers, any of which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and growth in all segments of our business. We are actively arranging additional third-party financing for our residential lease program; however, due to the general challenging credit markets worldwide, we may be unable to arrange additional financing partners for our residential lease program in future periods, which could have a negative impact on our sales. In the event we enter into a material number of additional leases without obtaining corresponding third-party financing, our cash, working capital and financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, in the United States, with the expiration of the Treasury Grant under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act program, we will need to identify, in the near term, interested financiers with sufficient taxable income to monetize the tax incentives created by our solar systems. In the long term, as we look towards incentive-less markets, we will continue to need to identify financiers willing to finance residential solar systems. Our plans to continue to grow our residential lease program may be delayed if credit conditions prevent us from obtaining or maintaining arrangement(s) to finance the program. The lack of project financing could delay the development and construction of our solar power plant projects, thus reducing our revenues from the sale of such projects. Many customers, especially in the United States, choose to purchase solar electricity under a PPA with a financing company that buys the system from us and the lack of availability of such financing could lead to reduced revenues. If economic recovery is slow in the United States or elsewhere, or if the European debt crisis remains unresolved or worsens, we may experience decreases in the demand for our solar power products, which may harm our operating results. We may in some cases seek to pursue partnership arrangements with financing entities to assist residential and other customers to obtain financing for the purchase or lease of our systems, which would expose us to credit or other risks. In addition, a rise in interest rates would likely increase our customers' cost of financing or leasing our products and could reduce their profits and expected returns on investment in our products. The general reduction in available credit to would-be borrowers or lessees, the poor state of economies worldwide, and the condition of housing markets worldwide could delay or reduce our sales of products to new homebuilders and authorized resellers. The reduction, modification or elimination of government and economic incentives could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results. The market for on-grid applications, where solar power is used to supplement a customer's electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff, depends in large part on the availability and size of government mandates and economic incentives because, at present, the cost of solar power generally exceeds retail electric rates in many locations and wholesale peak power rates in some locations. In addition, on-grid applications depend on access to the grid, which is also regulated by government entities. Incentives and mandates vary by geographic market. Various government bodies in most of the countries where we do business have provided incentives in the form of feed-in tariffs, rebates, and tax credits and other incentives and mandates, such as renewable portfolio standards, to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar power products to promote the use of solar energy in on-grid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. In 2011, some of these government mandates and economic incentives were reduced or fundamentally restructured, including the feed-in tariffs in Germany and incentives offered by other European countries, which has had a materially negative effect on the market size and price of solar systems in Europe and caused our earnings in 2011 and 2012 to decline in Europe and adversely affected our financial results. Governmental decisions regarding the provision of economic incentives often depend on political and economic factors that are largely beyond our control. Because our sales are into the on-grid market, the reduction, modification or elimination of grid access, government mandates and economic incentives in one or 18Table of Contentsmore of our customer markets would materially and adversely affect the growth of such markets or result in increased price competition, either of which could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results. Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services. The market for electric generation products is heavily influenced by federal, state and local government laws, regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry in the United States and abroad, as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation, and could deter further investment in the research and development of alternative energy sources as well as customer purchases of solar power technology, which could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our solar power products. The market for electric generation equipment is also influenced by trade and local content laws, regulations and policies which can discourage growth and competition in the solar industry, create economic barriers to the purchase of solar power products, thus reducing demand for our solar products. We anticipate that our solar power products and their installation will continue to be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to construction, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering, trade, and related matters. It is difficult to track the requirements of individual states or local jurisdictions and design equipment to comply with the varying standards. In addition, the U.S., European Union and Chinese governments have imposed tariffs or are in the process of evaluating the imposition of tariffs on solar panels, solar cells, polysilicon and potentially other components. These tariffs may increase the price of our solar products and adversely impact our cost reduction roadmap, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Any new regulations or policies pertaining to our solar power products may result in significant additional expenses to us, our resellers and our resellers' customers, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar power products. We may incur unexpected warranty and product liability claims that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our current standard product warranty for our solar panels includes a 25-year warranty period for defects in materials and workmanship and a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance. We believe our warranty offering exceeds industry practice. We perform accelerated lifecycle testing that expose our solar panels to extreme stress and climate conditions in both environmental simulation chambers and in actual field deployments in order to highlight potential failures that would occur over the 25-year warranty period. Due to the long warranty period, we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have shipped product and recognized revenue. Although we conduct accelerated testing of our solar panels and have several years of experience with our all-back-contact solar cell architecture, our solar panels have not and cannot be tested in an environment that exactly simulates the 25-year warranty period and it is difficult to test for all conditions that may occur in the field. We have sold solar panels since the early 2000's and have therefore not experienced the full warranty cycle. In our project installations, our current standard warranty for our solar power systems differs by geography and end-customer application and usually includes a limited warranty of 10 years for defects in work and workmanship, after which the customer may typically extend the period covered by its warranty for an additional fee. Due to the long warranty period, we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have completed a project and recognized revenues. Warranty and product liability claims may also result from defects or quality issues in certain third party technology and components that our business incorporates into its solar power systems, particularly solar cells and panels, over which we have little or no control. While we generally pass through to our customers manufacturer warranties we receive from our suppliers, in some circumstances, we may be responsible for repairing or replacing defective parts during our warranty period, often including those covered by manufacturers' warranties, or incur other non-warranty costs. If the manufacturer disputes or otherwise fails to honor its warranty obligations, we may be required to incur substantial costs before we are compensated, if at all, by the manufacturer. Furthermore, our warranties may exceed the period of any warranties from our suppliers covering components, such as third party solar cells, third party panels and third party inverters, included in our systems. In addition, manufacturer warranties may not fully compensate us for losses associated with third-party claims caused by defects or quality issues in their products. For example, most manufacturer warranties exclude many losses that may result from a system component's failure or defect, such as the cost of de-installation, re-installation, shipping, lost electricity, lost renewable energy credits or other solar incentives, personal injury, property damage, and other losses. In certain cases our direct warranty coverage provided by SunPower to our customers, and therefore our financial exposure, may exceed our recourse available against cell, panel or other manufacturers for defects in their products. In addition, in the event we seek recourse through warranties, we will also be dependent on the creditworthiness and continued existence of the suppliers to our business. Some of our suppliers have entered bankruptcy and our likelihood of a successful warranty claim against them is minimal. 19Table of ContentsIncreases in the defect rate of SunPower or third-party products could cause us to increase the amount of warranty reserves and have a corresponding negative impact on our results of operations. Further, potential future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products, and we have agreed in some circumstances to indemnify our customers and our distributors against liability from some defects in our solar products. A successful indemnification claim against us could require us to make significant damage payments. Repair and replacement costs, as well as successful indemnification claims, could materially and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Like other retailers, distributors and manufacturers of products that are used by customers, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of the solar power products into which solar cells and solar panels are incorporated results in injury, property damage or other damages. We may be subject to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our solar power systems fail to perform as expected or if a failure of our solar power systems results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage or other damages. Since our solar power products are electricity producing devices, it is possible that our systems could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. In addition, since we only began selling our solar cells and solar panels in the early 2000's and the products we are developing incorporate new technologies and use new installation methods, we cannot predict whether or not product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or the effect of any resulting negative publicity on our business. Moreover, we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us. We rely on our general liability insurance to cover product liability claims and have not obtained separate product liability insurance. A successful warranty or product liability claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages. In addition, quality issues can have various other ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, loss of future sales opportunities, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, which could also adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to successfully execute our cost reduction roadmap, and develop and introduce new and enhanced products and services, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenues will suffer. Our solar panels are currently competitive in the market compared with lower cost conventional solar cells, such as thin-film, due to their higher efficiency. If our competitors are able to drive down their manufacturing costs faster than us, our products may become less competitive even when adjusted for efficiency. While raw materials costs and other third party component costs have been decreasing, if such costs were to increase, we may not be able to meet our cost reduction targets. If we cannot effectively execute our cost reduction roadmap, our competitive position would suffer, and we could lose market share and our margins would be adversely impacted as we face downward pricing pressure.The solar power market is characterized by continually changing technology requiring improved features, such as increased efficiency and higher power output and improved aesthetics. Technologies developed by our direct competitors, including thin film solar panels, concentrating solar cells, solar thermal electric and other solar technologies, may provide power at lower costs than our products. We also face competition in some markets from other power generation sources, including conventional fossil fuels, wind, biomass, and hydro. In addition, other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems. Companies could also offer other value-added improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners, in which case such companies could compete with us even if the cost of electricity associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems. Our failure to further refine our technology, reduce cost in our manufacturing process, and develop and introduce new solar power products could cause our products or our manufacturing facilities to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which could reduce our market share, cause our sales to decline, and cause the impairment of our assets. This will require us to continuously develop new solar power products and enhancements for existing solar power products to keep pace with evolving industry standards, competitive pricing and changing customer requirements. If we cannot continually improve the efficiency of our solar panels as compared to those of our competitors, our pricing will become less competitive, we could lose market share and our margins would be adversely impacted. We have new products such as our C7 Tracker technology, which has not been mass deployed in the market. We need to prove its reliability in the field as well as drive down its cost in order to gain market acceptance. We also compete with traditional utilities that supply energy to our potential customers. Such utilities have greater financial, technical, operational and other resources than we do. If electricity rates decrease and our products become less competitive by comparison, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. As we introduce new or enhanced products or integrate new technology into our products, we will face risks relating to such transitions including, among other things, technical challenges, acceptance of products by our customers, disruption in customers' ordering patterns, insufficient supplies of new products to meet customers' demand, possible product and technology defects arising from the integration of new technology and a potentially different sales and support environment relating to any new technology. Our 20Table of Contentsfailure to manage the transition to newer products or the integration of newer technology into our products could adversely affect our business's operating results and financial condition. A limited number of customers and large projects are expected to continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from those customers or projects, payment of liquidated damages, or an increase in related expenses, could have a significant adverse effect on us. Even though we expect our customer base and number of large projects to expand and our revenue streams to diversify, a substantial portion of our revenues could continue to depend on sales to a limited number of customers as well as construction of a limited number of large projects (for example, the AVSP and CVSR projects), and the loss of sales to, or construction of, or inability to collect from those customers or for those projects, or an increase in expenses (such as financing costs) related to any such large projects, would have a significant negative impact on our business. For example, if the notice to proceed for AVSP phase 1 project (309 MW) is delayed or not obtained, it would have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. These larger projects create concentrated operating and financial risks. The effect of recognizing revenue or other financial measures on the sale of a larger project, or the failure to recognize revenue or other financial measures as anticipated in a given reporting period because a project is not yet completed under applicable accounting rules by period end, may materially impact our financial results. In addition, if construction, warranty or operational issues arise on a larger project, or if the timing of such projects unexpectedly shifts for other reasons, such issues could have a material impact on our financial results. Our agreements for such projects may be cancelled or we may incur large liquidated damages if we fail to execute the projects as planned, obtain certain approvals or consents by a specified time, meet certain product and project specifications, materially breach the governing agreements, or in the event of a customer's or project entity's bankruptcy, and our customers may seek to cancel or renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. In addition, the failure by any significant customer to pay for orders and the construction process, whether due to liquidity issues, failure of anticipated government support or otherwise, could materially and negatively affect our results of operations. We often do not have long-term agreements with our customers and accordingly could lose customers without warning, which could cause our operating results to decline. Our product sales to residential dealers and components customers are frequently not made under long-term agreements. We also contract to construct or sell large projects with no assurance of repeat business from the same customers in the future. Although we believe that cancellations on our purchase orders to date have been infrequent, our customers may cancel or reschedule purchase orders with us on relatively short notice. Cancellations or rescheduling of customer orders could result in the delay or loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce, or delay the incurrence of, our corresponding inventory and operating expenses. In addition, changes in forecasts or the timing of orders from these or other customers expose us to the risks of inventory shortages or excess inventory. These circumstances, in addition to the completion and non-repetition of large projects, declining average selling prices, changes in the relative mix of sales of solar equipment versus solar project installations, and the fact that our supply agreements are generally long-term in nature and many of our other operating costs are fixed, in turn could cause our operating results to fluctuate and may result in a material adverse effect in our business and financial results. In addition, since we rely partly on our network of dealers internationally for marketing and other promotional programs, if our dealers fail to perform up to our standards, our operating results may decline. Almost all of our engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") contracts are fixed price contracts which may be insufficient to cover unanticipated or dramatic changes in costs over the life of the project. Almost all of our EPC contracts are fixed price contracts. All essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the EPC contract for a particular project, and these are reflected in the overall price that we charge our customers for the project. These cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors, suppliers, and any other parties that may become necessary to complete the project. Thus, if the cost of materials were to rise dramatically as a result of sudden increased demand, or if financing costs were to increase due to use of the Liquidity Support Facility (as defined below) or otherwise, these costs may have to be borne by us. In addition, we require qualified, licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems. Shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs. In several instances in the past, we have obtained change orders that reimburse us for additional unexpected costs due to various reasons. Should miscalculations in planning a project or delays in execution occur, there can be no guarantee that we would be successful in obtaining reimbursement and we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period. Our business could be adversely affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles. 21Table of ContentsOur business is subject to significant industry-specific seasonal fluctuations. Sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends with the largest percentage of total revenues being realized during the last two calendar quarters. Low seasonal demand normally results in reduced shipments and revenues in the first two calendar quarters. There are various reasons for this seasonality, mostly related to economic incentives and weather patterns. For example, in European countries with feed-in tariffs, the construction of solar power systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year, largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum feed-in tariff and the fact that the coldest winter months in the Northern Hemisphere are January through March. In the United States, customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for other budgetary reasons. In addition, sales in the new home development market are often tied to construction market demands which tend to follow national trends in construction, including declining sales during cold weather months. The competitive environment in which we operate often requires us to undertake customer obligations that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations if our customer obligations are more costly than expected. We are often required as a condition of financing or at the request of our end customer to undertake certain obligations such as: System output performance guarantees;System maintenance;Penalty payments or customer termination rights if the system we are constructing is not commissioned within specified timeframes or other construction milestones are not achieved;Guarantees of certain minimum residual value of the system at specified future dates; andSystem put-rights whereby we could be required to buy-back a customer's system at fair value on specified future dates if certain minimum performance thresholds are not met. Such financing arrangements and customer obligations involve complex accounting analyses and judgments regarding the timing of revenue and expense recognition, and in certain situations these factors may require us to defer revenue recognition until projects are completed, which could adversely affect revenue and profits in a particular period. Risks Related to Our Liquidity Due to the general economic environment, the continued market pressure driving down the average selling prices of our solar power products, and other factors, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments as planned. We expect total capital expenditures related to purchases of property, plant and equipment in the range of $70 million to $90 million in fiscal 2013. To develop new products, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technology. We also anticipate increased costs as we make advance payments for raw materials or pay to procure such materials, especially polysilicon, increase our sales and marketing efforts, invest in joint ventures and acquisitions, invest in our residential lease business, and continue our research and development efforts with respect to our products and manufacturing technologies. Our manufacturing and assembly activities have required and will continue to require significant investment of capital and substantial engineering expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop solar power systems and plants for sale to customers. The development and construction of solar power plants can require long periods of time and substantial initial investments. The delayed disposition of such projects could have a negative impact on our liquidity. See "Risk Related to Our Operations-We may make significant investments in building solar power plants without first obtaining project financing, and the delayed sale of our projects would adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations." A significant portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers and large projects, and our inability to execute those projects, or to collect from those customers or for those projects, would have a significant negative impact on our business. See "Risk Related to Our Sales Channels-A limited number of customers and large projects are expected to continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from those customers or projects, payment of liquidated damages, or an increase in related expenses, could have a significant adverse effect on us.”22Table of ContentsOur capital expenditures and use of working capital may be greater than we currently expect if we decide to make additional investments in the development and construction of solar power plants, or if sales of power plants and associated cash proceeds are delayed, or if we decide to accelerate increases in our manufacturing capacity internally or through capital contributions to joint ventures. We require project financing in connection with the construction of solar power plants, which financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, we will in the future make additional investments in certain of our joint ventures or could guarantee certain financial obligations of our joint ventures, which could reduce our cash flows, increase our indebtedness and expose us to the credit risk of our joint ventures. In addition, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, or if the holders of our outstanding 4.50% convertible debentures due 2015 become entitled, and elect, to convert the debentures into cash, we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan or pay cash in connection with the redemption of outstanding 4.50% debentures. See "Our substantial indebtedness and other contractual commitments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to meet any of our payment obligations under the 4.50% and 4.75% debentures and our other debt."Certain of our customers also require performance bonds issued by a bonding agency, or bank guarantees or letters of credit issued by financial institutions, which are returned to SunPower upon satisfaction of contractual requirements. If there is a contractual dispute with the customer, the customer may withhold the security or make a draw under such security, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity position. As of December 30, 2012 letters of credit issued under the Deutsche Bank Trust facility amounted to $17.5 million and were fully collateralized with restricted cash. Our uncollateralized letter of credit facility with Deutsche Bank, which as of December 30, 2012 had an outstanding amount of $725.3 million, is guaranteed by Total S.A. pursuant to the Credit Support Agreement between us and Total S.A. Any draws under this uncollateralized facility would require SunPower to immediately reimburse the bank for the drawn amount. A default under the Credit Support Agreement or the guaranteed letter of credit facility, or if our other indebtedness greater than $25 million becomes accelerated, could cause Total S.A., subject to its obligations under the Liquidity Support Facility (described below), to declare all amounts due and payable to Total S.A. and direct the bank to cease issuing additional letters of credit on behalf of SunPower, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and funds available under our revolving credit facility with Credit Agricole will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and fund our committed capital expenditures over the next 12 months, including the development and construction of solar power plants over the next 12 months. As of December 30, 2012, $275.0 million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility with Credit Agricole. We are also party to a Liquidity Support Agreement with Total S.A. and the DOE, and a series of related agreements with Total S.A. or its affiliates, under which Total S.A. has agreed to provide us with a liquidity facility to a maximum amount of $600 million (the “Liquidity Support Facility”). Total S.A. is required, through its affiliates, to provide liquidity support to us under this facility, and we are required to accept such liquidity support from Total, S.A., if either our actual or projected unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity are reduced below $100 million, or we fail to satisfy any financial covenant under our indebtedness, including the Credit Agricole facility. In either such event, subject to an $600 million aggregate limit, Total S.A. is required to provide us with sufficient liquidity support to increase the amount of our unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity to above $100 million, and to restore our compliance with our financial covenants. In general, our cost of financing under the Liquidity Support Agreement would increase as the aggregate amount of liquidity support we require over time increases. On December 24, 2012, Total S.A. agreed to guarantee our revolving credit facility with Credit Agricole, which reduced the capacity available under the Liquidity Support Facility by $275 million. The lenders under our credit facilities and holders of our debentures may also require us to repay our indebtedness to them in the event that our obligations under other indebtedness or contracts in excess of the applicable threshold amount, such as $25 million, are accelerated and we fail to discharge such obligations. If our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, for example, due to cross acceleration of indebtedness, we may seek to sell additional equity securities or debt securities or obtain other debt financings, including under the Liquidity Support Facility; although the current economic environment could also limit our ability to raise capital by issuing new equity or debt securities on acceptable terms, and lenders may be unwilling to lend funds on acceptable terms. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities, including under the Liquidity Support Facility, may result in additional dilution to our stockholders and may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additional debt would result in increased expenses and could impose new restrictive covenants which may be similar or different than those restrictions contained in the covenants under certain of our current debt agreements and debentures. Financing arrangements, including project financing for our solar power plants and letters of credit facilities, may not be available to us, or may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If additional financing is 23Table of Contentsnot available, we may also seek to sell assets, or reduce or delay capital investments, which could negatively impact our financial results. Under certain circumstances under the Liquidity Support Facility, we are required to issue to Total S.A. or its affiliates, in exchange for the provision of liquidity support, warrants to purchase our common stock. The number of shares of our common stock covered by these warrants will be equal to an agreed percentage of the amount of support provided at a particular time, divided by the volume-weighted average of our stock price over the 30-day trading period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date when the support is provided. The exercise price of these warrants is also set by reference to this volume-weighted average price, and therefore may be set at a discount to our stock price currently or at the time the warrants are issued. Any convertible debt we issue to Total S.A. or its affiliates under the Liquidity Support Facility will be convertible into our common stock at its market price at the time of conversion, which may be lower than our current stock price. Finally, any common stock we issue to Total S.A. under the Liquidity Support Facility will be priced at a 17% discount to the volume-weighted average stock price for the 30-day trading period ending on the trading day preceding the date of issuance. For all these reasons, use of the Liquidity Support Facility could be dilutive to the equity interests of our other stockholders, and the degree of dilution will increase if our stock price decreases. Any other equity financing we may seek would also likely be dilutive to our stockholders' equity interests. In the first half of 2013, $275 million of Credit Agricole revolver and $230 million of 4.75% debentures will have a maturity of less than 12 months and be reclassified to short term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. We are evaluating options to repay or refinance such indebtedness during 2013 or 2014, but there are no assurances that we will have sufficient available cash to repay such indebtedness or we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on similar terms to the expiring indebtedness. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flows, find other sources of capital to fund our operations and solar power plant projects, make adequate capital investments to remain technologically and price competitive, or provide bonding or letters of credit required by our projects, we will need to sell additional equity securities or debt securities, or obtain other debt financings. If adequate funds and other resources are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, develop and construct solar power plants, develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network, maintain our research and development efforts, provide collateral for our projects, meet our debt service obligations, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly impaired. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our substantial indebtedness and other contractual commitments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to meet any of our payment obligations under the 4.50% and 4.75% debentures and our other debt. We currently have a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements that could have material consequences on our future operations, including:making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under the 4.50% and 4.75% debentures and our other outstanding debt;resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements (with certain covenants becoming more restrictive over time), which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable if not cured pursuant to the Liquidity Support Facility;reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, project development, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates;subjecting us to the risk of currency fluctuations and government-fixed foreign exchange rates and the effects of currency hedging activity or inability to hedge currency fluctuation;limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; andplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.24Table of ContentsOur indebtedness may increase if we require liquidity support from Total S.A. under the Liquidity Support Facility, and in general the economic cost of such indebtedness will increase, both in absolute dollars and in our cost per dollar borrowed, if the aggregate amount of liquidity support we require increases. In the event our joint ventures are consolidated with our financial statements, such consolidation could significantly increase our indebtedness. Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the 4.50% and 4.75% debentures and our other debt. In addition, we also have significant contractual commitments for the purchase of polysilicon, some of which involve prepayments, and we may enter into additional, similar long-term supply agreements in the future. Further, if the holders of our outstanding 4.50% debentures have been entitled to, and do convert their debentures, the principal amount must be settled in cash. Future conversions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.Our current tax holidays in the Philippines and Switzerland will expire within the next several years.We currently benefit from income tax holiday incentives in the Philippines in accordance with our subsidiary's registration with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority ("PEZA"), which provide that we pay no income tax in the Philippines for those operations subject to the ruling. Our current income tax holidays were granted as manufacturing lines were placed in service and thereafter expire within this fiscal year, and we are in the process of or have applied for extensions and renewals upon expiration. We currently expect such approvals to be granted. We believe that if our Philippine tax holidays expire, (a) gross income attributable to activities covered by our PEZA registrations will be taxed at a 5% preferential rate, and (b) our Philippine net income attributable to all other activities will be taxed at the statutory Philippine corporate income tax rate, currently 30%. An increase in our tax liability could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.We have an auxiliary company ruling in Switzerland where we sell our solar power products. The auxiliary company ruling results in a reduced effective Swiss tax rate of approximately 11.5%. The current ruling expires in 2015. If the ruling is not renewed in 2015, Swiss income would be taxable at the full Swiss tax rate of approximately 24.2%.Our joint venture AUOSP benefits from a tax holiday granted by the Malaysian government subject to certain hiring, capital spending, and manufacturing requirements. The joint venture partners of AUOSP have decided to postpone the construction of an additional manufacturing facility ("Fab 3B") due to current solar market conditions, which fails to meet certain conditions required to continue to benefit from the tax ruling. Our joint venture is currently in discussions with the Malaysian government to extend the period by which buildout has to be completed. Should AUOSP be unable to renegotiate the tax ruling, they would be subject to statutory tax rates which could negatively impact our share of equity earnings reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.A change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business, and an adverse outcome resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.A number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to our interpretation of transfer pricing standards, changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (for example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform); changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; expiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. A change in our effective tax rate due to any of these factors may adversely impact our future results from operations. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from any examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. An adverse determination of an examination could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - "Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplemental Data."25Table of ContentsWe have significant balances of refundable value added tax outside the U.S., which we believe are fully recoverable, but if the amounts are determined by tax authorities to be nonrefundable, it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. Our insurance for certain indemnities we have made to our officers and directors may be inadequate, and potential claims could materially and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and indemnification agreements require us to indemnify our officers and directors for certain liabilities that may arise in the course of their service to us. Although we currently maintain directors and officers liability insurance for certain potential third-party claims for which we are legally or financially unable to indemnify them, such insurance may be inadequate for specific claims. In addition, in previous years, we have primarily self-insured with respect to potential third-party claims. If we were required to pay a significant amount on account of these liabilities for which we self-insured, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. See also "Risks Related to Our Operations -- We and certain of our current and former officers and directors have been named as parties to various lawsuits relating to our past Audit Committee accounting investigation, and may be named in further litigation, including with respect to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, all of which could require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer." Our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business. We may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing, because our debt agreements, our Credit Support Agreement and our Liquidity Support Agreement with Total S.A., our Affiliation Agreement with Total, foreign exchange hedging agreements and equity derivative agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;create liens;make certain investments or acquisitions;enter into transactions with our affiliates;sell certain assets;redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments;declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders; andmerge or consolidate with any person.Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the 4.50% and 4.75% debentures and our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if the default is not cured pursuant to the Liquidity Support Facility. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.Risks Related to Our Supply Chain Limited competition among suppliers has required us in some instances to enter into long-term, firm commitment supply agreements that could result in excess or insufficient inventory, place us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing, or lead to disputes, each of which could impair our ability to meet our cost reduction roadmap.Due to the industry-wide shortage of polysilicon experienced prior to 2011, we purchased polysilicon that we resold to third-party ingot and wafer manufacturers who deliver wafers to us that we then use in the manufacturing of our solar cells. Without sufficient polysilicon, some of those ingot and wafer manufacturers would not have been able to produce the wafers on 26Table of Contentswhich we rely. To match our estimated customer demand forecasts and growth strategy for the next several years, we have historically entered into multiple long-term supply agreements. Some agreements have long terms and provide for fixed or inflation-adjusted pricing, substantial prepayment obligations, and firm purchase commitments that require us to pay for the supply whether or not we accept delivery. If any long term and fixed commitment agreements require us to purchase more supplies than required to meet our actual customer demand over time, the resulting excess inventory could materially and negatively impact our results of operations. Prices for raw materials and components have been rapidly declining. If we are unable to access spot market pricing of commodities and decrease our dependency on long term or fixed commitment supply agreements, we would be paying more at unfavorable payment terms for such supplies than the current market prices and payment terms available to our competitors. We would then be placed at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who were able to leverage better pricing, we would be unable to meet our cost reduction roadmap, and our profitability could decline. Certain of our long-term supply agreements may also contain other provisions, such as termination rights, that enable us to respond to changes in our requirements for, and market conditions in respect of polysilicon, ingots or wafers. However, our exercise of such rights may give rise to disputes. For example, we are currently engaged in arbitration with First Philec Solar Corporation, one of our suppliers, which is also a joint venture in which we have a minority interest. First Philec Solar is claiming damages for our purported failure to fulfill our purchase commitment under a 2007 wafer supply contract that we believe we validly terminated in August 2012. Additionally, First Solar Electric Corporation, our co-venturer in First Philec Solar, has claimed that our failure to fulfill our purchase agreement also obligates us to purchase its interests in the joint venture at a premium. Although we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims, and that we have made meritorious counterclaims against First Philec Solar and First Solar Electric, the outcome of the arbitration is not certain and an adverse award may adversely affect our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. If our agreements provide insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, or if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide us with the contracted quantities, we could purchase additional supply at available market prices which could be greater than expected and could materially and negatively impact our results of operations. Such market prices could also be greater than prices paid by our competitors, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and leading to a decline in our profitability. Further, we face significant specific counterparty risk under long-term supply agreements when dealing with suppliers without a long, stable production and financial history. In the event any such supplier experiences financial difficulties or goes into bankruptcy, it could be difficult or impossible, or may require substantial time and expense, for us to recover any or all of our prepayments. In the event any such supplier experiences financial difficulties or goes into bankruptcy, we would also be unlikely to collect for warranty claims against such suppliers. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations. We will continue to be dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain raw materials and components for our products, which could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers within required timeframes, which in turn could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments and loss of market share. We rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers, including our joint ventures, for certain raw materials and components for our solar cells, panels and power systems such as polysilicon, inverters and module material. If we fail to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, or if suppliers are unable to meet demand through industry consolidation, we may be unable to manufacture our products or our products may be available only at a higher cost or after a long delay. Such delays could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers within required timeframes and cause order cancellations and loss of market share. To the extent the processes that our suppliers use to manufacture components are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers. In addition, the financial markets could limit our suppliers' ability to raise capital if required to expand their production or satisfy their operating capital requirements. As a result, they could be unable to supply necessary raw materials, inventory and capital equipment to us which we would require to support our planned sales operations which would in turn negatively impact our sales volumes profitability and cash flows. The failure of a supplier to supply raw materials or components in a timely manner, or to supply raw materials or components that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or increase the cost of production. If we cannot obtain substitute materials or components on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we could be prevented from delivering our products to our customers within required timeframes, which could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows.If third-party manufacturers become unable or unwilling to sell their solar cells or panels to us, our business and results of operations may be materially negatively affected.27Table of ContentsIn January 2012, we completed the acquisition of Tenesol S.A. ("Tenesol"), a European-based manufacturer and developer of solar projects with module manufacturing operations in France and South Africa which formerly operated under the common control of Total S.A. Through Tenesol, we purchase a portion of our total product mix from third-party manufacturers of solar cells. Such products increase our inventory available for sale to customers in some markets. However, such manufacturers may not be willing to sell solar cells and panels to us at the quantities and on the terms and conditions we require. Such manufacturers may be our direct competitors. If they are unable or unwilling to sell to us, we may not have sufficient products available to sell to customers and satisfy our sales commitments, thereby materially and negatively affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, warranty and product liability claims may result from defects or quality issues in connection with third party solar cells that we incorporate into our solar power products. See also “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels -- We may incur unexpected warranty and product liability claims that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.” Risks Related to Our Operations We may make significant investments in building solar power plants without first obtaining project financing, and the delayed sale of our projects would adversely affect our business, liquidity, and results of operations. The development and construction of solar power plants require long periods of time and substantial initial investments, which we may make without first obtaining project financing or getting final regulatory clearance. Such costs may never be recovered if the necessary permits and government support and approvals are not obtained, project financing is not obtained, or if a potential project sale cannot be completed on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our efforts in this area may consist of all stages of development, including land acquisition, permitting, financing, construction, operation, and the eventual sale of the projects. We will often choose to bear the costs of such efforts prior to obtaining project financing, prior to getting final regulatory clearance, and prior to our final sale to a customer, if any. This involves significant upfront investments of resources (including, for example, large transmission deposits or other payments, which may be non-refundable), land acquisition, permitting, legal and other costs, and in some cases the actual costs of constructing a project, in advance of the signing of PPAs and EPC contracts, the sale of equity in the project and the receipt of any cash or revenue, much of which may not be recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing. Our ability to monetize solar power plant projects is dependent on successfully executing and selling large scale projects and often a single project can account for a material portion of our total revenue in a given quarter. We have deferred revenue recognition on certain construction projects until the projects have been financed, constructed, and sold to independent third parties. Alternatively, we may choose to build, own and operate certain solar power plants for a period of time, after which the project assets may be sold to third parties. In such cases, the delayed disposition of projects could require us to recognize a gain on the sale of assets instead of recognizing revenue. Our potential inability to obtain regulatory clearance, required government support, project financing, or enter into sales contracts with customers could adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations. Our inability to monetize our projects as planned, or any delay in obtaining the required initial payments to begin recognizing revenue under the relevant recognition criteria, and the corresponding revenue impact under the percentage-of-completion method of recognizing revenue, may cause large fluctuations in our revenue and other financial results. In the event the project is subsequently canceled, abandoned, or is deemed likely to occur, we will charge all prior capital costs as an operating expense in the quarter in which such determination is made, which could materially adversely affect operating results. Our liquidity could also be adversely impacted if we cannot obtain timely project financing or if project sales are delayed. We have significant international activities and customers, and plan to continue these efforts, which subject us to additional business risks, including logistical complexity and political instability. A substantial portion of our sales are made to customers outside of the United States, and a substantial portion of our supply agreements are with supply and equipment vendors located outside of the United States. Currently our solar cell and module production lines are located at our manufacturing facilities in the Philippines, Mexico, France and South Africa, and our joint venture's manufacturing facility in Malaysia. In addition, in January 2012, we completed the acquisition of Tenesol, a European-based manufacturer and developer of solar projects with significant international operations. Risks we face in conducting business internationally include:multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations, export and import restrictions, employment laws, environmental protection, regulatory requirements and other government approvals, permits and licenses;difficulties and costs in staffing and managing foreign operations as well as cultural differences;potentially adverse tax consequences associated with our permanent establishment of operations in more countries;28Table of Contentsrelatively uncertain legal systems, including potentially limited protection for intellectual property rights, and laws, changes in the governmental incentives we rely on, regulations and policies which impose additional restrictions on the ability of foreign companies to conduct business in certain countries or otherwise place them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to domestic companies;repatriation of non-U.S. earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory effective tax rate;inadequate local infrastructure and developing telecommunications infrastructures;financial risks, such as longer sales and payment cycles and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable;currency fluctuations and government-fixed foreign exchange rates and the effects of currency hedging activity or inability to hedge currency fluctuations;political and economic instability, including wars, acts of terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailments of trade and other business restrictions;trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries; andliabilities associated with compliance with laws (for example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws outside of the United States).In addition, we need to manage our international operations with an efficient and scalable organization. If we are unable to effectively manage our international inventory and warehouses, for example, our shipping movements may not map with product demand and flow. If we are unable to successfully manage any such risks, any one or more could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we experience interruptions in the operation of our solar cell production lines, or we are not successful in operating our joint venture AUOSP, our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If our current or future solar cell or module production lines were to experience any problems or downtime, we would be unable to meet our production targets and our business would suffer. Our manufacturing activities have required and will continue to require significant management attention, a significant investment of capital and substantial engineering expenditures. Under a joint venture agreement, we and AU Optronics Corporation ("AUO") jointly own and manage a joint venture, AUO SunPower Sdn. Bhd. (“AUOSP”), that has constructed a manufacturing facility in Malaysia. The success of our joint venture is subject to significant risks including:cost overruns, delays, supply shortages, equipment problems and other operating difficulties;custom-built equipment may take longer and cost more to engineer than planned and may never operate as designed;incorporating first-time equipment designs and technology improvements, which we expect to lower unit capital and operating costs, but this new technology may not be successful;problems managing the joint venture with AUO, whom we do not control and whose business objectives may be different from ours and may be inconsistent with our best interests;the joint venture's ability to obtain or maintain third party financing to fund its capital requirements;difficulties in maintaining or improving our historical yields and manufacturing efficiencies;difficulties in protecting our intellectual property and obtaining rights to intellectual property developed by the joint venture;difficulties in hiring key technical, management, and other personnel;29Table of Contentsdifficulties in integration, implementing IT infrastructure and an effective control environment; andpotential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, financing, or approvals from governmental authorities for operations. If we experience any of these or similar difficulties, our supply from the joint venture may be delayed or be more costly than expected, substantially constraining our supply of solar cells. The joint venture partners of AUOSP have decided to postpone the construction of an additional manufacturing facility ("Fab 3B") due to current solar market conditions, and therefore assessed that additional equity need not be provided to AUOSP at this time. As a result, as of December 31, 2012, AUOSP is in technical breach of a covenant in its $300 million secured loan facility which required the joint venture partners to make equity injections in 2012. AUOSP is currently working with its lenders and will be providing its lenders with 2012 audited financial statements in the second quarter of 2013 to request that the lenders grant a waiver for the technical covenant breach. This default does not create a cross default under SunPower's debt agreements so long as AUOSP remains unconsolidated, is not a "significant subsidiary" as defined by Reg S-X of Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and SunPower's ownership in AUOSP remains no higher than 50%. However, if the lenders were to accelerate payment on the loan or enforce their security interest, the supply of solar cells to SunPower could be interrupted. If we are unable to utilize our manufacturing capacity at the joint venture as planned, or we experience interruptions in the operation of our existing production lines, our per-unit manufacturing costs would increase, we would be unable to increase sales or gross margins as planned, we may need to increase our supply of third party cells, and our results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. If we do not achieve satisfactory yields or quality in manufacturing our solar products, our sales could decrease and our relationships with our customers and our reputation may be harmed. The manufacture of solar cells is a highly complex process. Minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yield and in some cases, cause production to be suspended or yield no output. We have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. As we expand our manufacturing capacity and qualify additional suppliers, we may initially experience lower yields. If we do not achieve planned yields, our product costs could increase, and product availability would decrease resulting in lower revenues than expected. In addition, in the process of transforming polysilicon into ingots, a significant portion of the polysilicon is removed in the process. In circumstances where we provide the polysilicon, if our suppliers do not have very strong controls in place to ensure maximum recovery and utilization, our economic yield can be less than anticipated, which would increase the cost of raw materials to us. Additionally, products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced. For example, our solar cells or solar panels may contain defects that are not detected until after they are shipped or are installed because we cannot test for all possible scenarios. These defects could cause us to incur significant warranty, non-warranty and re-engineering costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts and significantly affect our customer relations and business reputation. If we deliver solar products with errors or defects, including cells or panels of third-party manufacturers, or if there is a perception that such solar products contain errors or defects, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be harmed. In addition, some of our arrangements with customers include termination or put rights for non-performance. In certain limited cases, we could incur liquidated damages or even be required to buy-back a customer's system at fair value on specified future dates if certain minimum performance thresholds are not met. A change in our anticipated 1603 Treasury cash grant proceeds or solar investment tax credits could adversely impact our business, revenues, margins, results of operations and cash flows.We have incorporated into our financial planning and agreements with our customers certain assumptions regarding the future level of U.S. tax incentives, including the §48(c) solar commercial investment tax credit (“ITC”) and the Treasury grant under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the "Cash Grant") program, which is administered by the U.S. Treasury Department ("Treasury") and provides Cash Grant payments in lieu of the ITC. The ITC and Cash Grant allow qualified applicants to claim an amount equal to 30% of the eligible cost basis for qualifying solar energy property. We hold projects and have sold projects to certain customers based on certain underlying assumptions regarding the ITC and Cash Grant, including for CVSR and AVSP. We have also accounted for certain projects and programs in our business using the same assumptions.Owners of our qualifying projects and our residential lease program have applied or will apply for the ITC, and have applied or will apply for the Cash Grant. We have structured the tax incentive applications, both in timing and amount, to be in accordance with the guidance provided by Treasury and Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). Any changes to the Treasury or IRS 30Table of Contentsguidance which we relied upon in structuring our projects, failure to comply with the requirements, including the safe harbor protocols, lower levels of incentives granted, or changes in assumptions including the estimated residual values and the estimated fair market value of financed and installed systems for the purposes of Cash Grant and ITC applications, could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. While we have received notification that certain of our applications will be fully paid by Treasury in 2013, if the IRS or Treasury disagrees, as a result of any future review or audit, with the fair market value of, or other assumptions concerning, our solar projects or systems that we have constructed or that we construct in the future, including any systems for which tax incentives have already been paid, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We also have obligations to indemnify certain of our customers for the loss of tax incentives to such customers. We may have to recognize impairments or lower margins than initially anticipated for certain of our projects, including AVSP, CVSR and our residential lease program. Additionally, if the amount or timing of the Cash Grant or ITC payments received varies from what we have projected, this will impact our revenues, margins and cash flows and we may have to recognize losses, which will adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.Pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, Cash Grants could be subject to sequestration beginning in 2013. The U.S. federal government's Office of Management and Budget, in a report issued in September 2012, outlined the anticipated sequestration, which would result in approximately a 9% reduction in spending for the Cash Grant, with a resulting decrease in Cash Grant received by us. In addition, applicable authorities may adjust or decrease incentives from time to time or include provisions for minimum domestic content requirements or other requirements to qualify for these incentives. Any such reduction or additional requirements could adversely impact our results of operations.There are continuing developments in the interpretation and application of how companies should calculate their eligibility and level of Cash Grant and ITC incentives. There have been recent cases in the U.S. district courts which challenge the criteria for a true lease, which could impact whether the structure of our residential lease program qualifies under the Cash Grant and ITC. Additionally, the Office of the Inspector General of the Treasury has issued subpoenas to a number of significant participants in the rooftop solar energy installation industry. The Inspector General is working with the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the administration and implementation of the Cash Grant program, including possible misrepresentations concerning the fair market value of the solar power systems submitted for Cash Grant under that program. While we have not received a subpoena, we could be asked to participate as a part of the information gathering process. The results of the current investigation could impact the underlying assumption used by the solar industry, including us, in our Cash Grant and ITC applications, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.We obtain certain of our capital equipment used in our manufacturing process from sole suppliers and if this equipment is damaged or otherwise unavailable, our ability to deliver products on time will suffer, which in turn could result in order cancellations and loss of revenue. Some of the capital equipment used in the manufacture of our solar power products has been developed and made specifically for us, is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working. If any of these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or go out of business, or if there were any damage to or a breakdown of our manufacturing equipment, our business would suffer. In addition, a supplier's failure to supply this equipment in a timely manner, with adequate quality and on terms acceptable to us, could delay our future capacity expansion or manufacturing process improvements and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our costs of production. Project development or construction activities may not be successful, which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments. The development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks. We may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being built. Successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:failures or delays in obtaining desired or necessary land rights, including ownership, leases and/or easements;failures or delays in obtaining necessary permits, licenses or other governmental support or approvals, or in overcoming objections from members of the public or adjoining land owners;uncertainties relating to land costs for projects;unforeseen engineering problems;31Table of Contentsaccess to available transmission for electricity generated by our solar power plants;construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls;work stoppages or labor disruptions;cost over-runs;availability of products and components from suppliers;adverse weather conditions;environmental, archaeological and geological conditions; andavailability of construction and permanent financing.If we are unable to complete the development of a solar power plant, or fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates, we may be subject to liquidated damages and/or penalties under the EPC agreement or other agreements relating to the power plant, and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project. We expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects initially owned by us or ultimately owned by third parties. If we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project, we may write-down or write-off some or all of these capitalized investments, which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized. We may be unable to obtain financing for our residential lease program and we may be unable to extend our third party ownership model to other jurisdictions, which could all have an adverse effect on our growth and financial results.We offer a residential lease program in partnership with third-party financial institutions, which allows residential customers to obtain our systems under lease agreements for terms of up to 20 years. We are actively arranging additional third-party financing for our residential lease program; however, due to the general challenging credit markets worldwide, we may be unable to arrange additional financing partners for our residential lease program in future periods, which could limit our sales and our plans to grow the residential lease program. If financing costs were to increase, our lease product will be less attractive to our customers. In the event we enter into a material number of additional leases without obtaining corresponding third-party financing, our cash, working capital and financial results could be negatively impacted. Our residential lease program has been and will be eligible for the ITC and Cash Grant. We have relied on, and will continue to rely on, financing structures that monetize a substantial portion of those benefits. If, for any reason, we were unable to continue to monetize the tax benefits in our financing structures, we may be unable to provide financing or pricing that is attractive for our customers. Under current law, the ITC will be reduced from approximately 30% of the cost of the solar systems to approximately 10% for solar systems placed in service after December 31, 2016. In addition, Cash Grants are no longer available for new solar systems. Changes in existing law and interpretations by the IRS, Treasury and the courts could reduce the willingness of fund investors to invest in funds associated with our residential lease program. Additionally, if the amount or timing Cash Grant payments or ITC received in connection with the residential lease program varies from what we have projected, this will impact our revenues, cash flows and margins and we may have to recognize losses, which will adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. See also “A change in our anticipated 1603 Treasury cash grant proceeds or solar investment tax credit could adversely impact our business, revenues, margins, results of operations and cash flows.”We have to quickly build infrastructure to support the residential lease program, and any failure or delay in implementing the necessary processes and infrastructure could adversely impact our financial results. We establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of the customers. We may not be able to collect from rent payments from our residential lease customers in the event they enter into bankruptcy or otherwise fail to make payments when due after the period in which the third-party financial institution has agreed to assume this risk ends. We make certain assumptions in accounting for the solar lease program, including, among others, the residual value of the leased systems. As the residential lease program grows, if the residual value of leased systems does not materialize as assumed, it will adversely impact our results of operations. At the end of the term of the lease, our customers have the option to purchase at fair market value, extend the lease or return the leased systems to us. Should there be a large number of returns, we may incur de-installation costs in excess of amounts reserved. Our leases are third-party ownership arrangements. Sales of electricity by third parties face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. Other challenges pertain to whether third-party owned systems qualify for the same levels of rebates or other non-tax incentives available for customer-owned solar energy systems. Reductions in, or eliminations of, this 32Table of Contentstreatment of these third-party arrangements could reduce demand for our residential lease program. As we look to extend the third party ownership model outside of the U.S., we will be faced with the same risks and uncertainties we have in the U.S. Our growth outside of the U.S. could depend on our ability to expand the third party ownership model, and our failure to successfully implement a third-party ownership model globally could adversely impact our financial results.We act as the general contractor for many of our customers in connection with the installations of our solar power systems and are subject to risks associated with construction, cost overruns, delays and other contingencies tied to performance bonds and letters of credit, or other required credit and liquidity support guarantees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We act as the general contractor for many of our customers in connection with the installation of our solar power systems. Some customers require performance bonds issued by a bonding agency or letters of credit issued by financial institutions, or may require other forms of liquidity support. Due to the general performance risk inherent in construction activities, it has become increasingly difficult recently to attain suitable bonding agencies willing to provide performance bonding. Obtaining letters of credit may require collateral. In the event we are unable to obtain bonding or sufficient letters of credit or other liquidity support, we will be unable to bid on, or enter into, sales contracts requiring such bonding. See also "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels--Almost all of our engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") contracts are fixed price contracts which may be insufficient to cover unanticipated or dramatic changes in costs over the life of the project." In addition, the contracts with some of our larger customers require that we would be obligated to pay substantial penalty payments for each day or other period a solar installation for any such customer is not completed beyond an agreed target date, up to and including the return of the entire project sale price. This is particularly true in Europe, where long-term, fixed feed-in tariffs available to investors are typically set during a prescribed period of project completion, but the fixed amount declines over time for projects completed in subsequent periods. We face material financial penalties in the event we fail to meet the completion deadlines, including but not limited a full refund of the contract price paid by the customers. In certain cases we do not control all of the events which could give rise to these penalties, such as reliance on the local utility to timely complete electrical substation construction. Furthermore, investors often require that the solar power system generate specified levels of electricity in order to maintain their investment returns, allocating substantial risk and financial penalties to us if those levels are not achieved, up to and including the return of the entire project sale price. Also, our customers often require protections in the form of conditional payments, payment retentions or holdbacks, and similar arrangements that condition its future payments on performance. Delays in solar panel or other supply shipments, other construction delays, unexpected performance problems in electricity generation or other events could cause us to fail to meet these performance criteria, resulting in unanticipated and severe revenue and earnings losses and financial penalties. Construction delays are often caused by inclement weather, failure to timely receive necessary approvals and permits, or delays in obtaining necessary solar panels, inverters or other materials. Additionally, we sometimes purchase land in connection with project development and assume the risk of project completion. All such risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Acquisitions of other companies or investments in joint ventures with other companies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and dilute our stockholders' equity. To increase our business and maintain our competitive position, we have and may continue to acquire other companies or engage in joint ventures in the future. For example, in March 2010, we completed our acquisition of SunRay, in July 2010, we formed AUOSP as a joint venture with AUO, and in January 2012, we acquired Tenesol. In December 2012, we entered into a joint venture agreement with partners in China to manufacture our C-7 Tracker systems for the Chinese market. Acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of risks that could harm our business and result in the acquired business or joint venture not performing as expected, including:insufficient experience with technologies and markets in which the acquired business or joint venture is involved, which may be necessary to successfully operate and/or integrate the business or the joint venture;problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, IT infrastructure, technologies or products with the existing business and products;diversion of management time and attention from the core business to the acquired business or joint venture;33Table of Contentspotential failure to retain or hire key technical, management, sales and other personnel of the acquired business or joint venture;difficulties in retaining or building relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business or joint venture, particularly where such customers or suppliers compete with us;potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality and development or legal and financial liabilities, among other things;potential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities or work councils, which could delay or prevent acquisitions, delay our ability to achieve synergies, or our successful operation of acquired companies or joint ventures;potential necessity to re-apply for permits of acquired projects;problems managing joint ventures with our partners, meeting capital requirements for expansion, and reliance upon joint ventures which we do not control; for example, our ability to effectively manage our joint venture with AUO;subsequent impairment of the acquired assets, including intangible assets; andassumption of liabilities including, but not limited to, lawsuits, tax examinations, warranty issues, and liabilities associated with compliance with laws (for example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act).Additionally, we may decide that it is in our best interests to enter into acquisitions or joint ventures that are dilutive to earnings per share or that negatively impact margins as a whole. In an effort to reduce our cost of goods sold, we have and may continue to enter into acquisitions or joint ventures involving suppliers or manufacturing partners, which would expose us to additional supply chain risks. Acquisitions or joint ventures could also require investment of significant financial resources and require us to obtain additional equity financing, which may dilute our stockholders' equity, or require us to incur additional indebtedness. Such equity or debt financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, we could in the future make additional investments in our joint ventures or guarantee certain financial obligations of our joint ventures, which could reduce our cash flows, increase our indebtedness and expose us to the credit risk of our joint ventures. To the extent that we invest in upstream suppliers or downstream channel capabilities, we may experience competition or channel conflict with certain of our existing and potential suppliers and customers. Specifically, existing and potential suppliers and customers may perceive that we are competing directly with them by virtue of such investments and may decide to reduce or eliminate their supply volume to us or order volume from us. In particular, any supply reductions from our polysilicon, ingot or wafer suppliers could materially reduce manufacturing volume. Moreover, our joint venture arrangements may lead to disputes with our co-venturers. For example, we are currently engaged in arbitration with First Solar Electric Corporation, our co-venturer in First Philec Solar Corporation, a Philippines wafer manufacturing joint venture in which we hold a minority interest. See also “Risks Related to Our Supply Chain-Limited competition among suppliers has required us in some instances to enter into long-term, firm commitment supply agreements that could result in excess or insufficient inventory, place us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing or lead to disputes, each of which could impair our ability to meet our cost reduction roadmap.”We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may not be able to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. We plan to continue to improve our manufacturing processes and build additional cell manufacturing production capacity in 2016, which will require successful execution of:expanding our existing manufacturing facilities and developing new manufacturing facilities, which would increase our fixed costs and, if such facilities are underutilized, would negatively impact our results of operations;ensuring delivery of adequate polysilicon and ingots;enhancing our customer resource management and manufacturing management systems;34Table of Contentsimplementing and improving additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls, including the need to centralize, update and integrate our global financial internal control;hiring additional employees;expanding and upgrading our technological capabilities;managing multiple relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties;maintaining adequate liquidity and financial resources; andcontinuing to increase our revenues from operations.Improving our manufacturing processes, expanding our manufacturing facilities or developing new facilities may be delayed by difficulties such as unavailability of equipment or supplies or equipment malfunction. Ensuring delivery of adequate polysilicon and ingots is subject to many market risks including scarcity, significant price fluctuations and competition. Maintaining adequate liquidity is dependent upon a variety of factors including continued revenues from operations, working capital improvements, and compliance with our indentures and credit agreements. If we are unsuccessful in any of these areas, we may not be able to achieve our growth strategy and increase production capacity as planned during the foreseeable future. In addition, we need to manage our organizational growth, including rationalizing reporting structures, support teams, and enabling efficient decision making. For example, the administration of the residential lease program requires processes and systems to support this new business model. If we are not successful or if we delay our implementation of such systems and processes, we may adversely affect the anticipated volumes in our residential lease business. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, develop new solar cells and other products, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. As a result of fluctuations in the demand for our products, our project assets and other long-lived assets may be impaired, or we may write off equipment or inventory, and each of these events would adversely affect our future financial results.We have tangible project assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to capitalized costs incurred in connection with the development of solar power systems. Project assets consist primarily of capitalized costs relating to solar power system projects in various stages of development that we incur prior to the sale of the solar power system to a third party. These costs include costs for land and costs for developing and constructing a solar power system. These project assets could become impaired if there are changes in the fair value of these capitalized costs. If these project assets become impaired, we may write-off some or all of the capitalized project assets, which would have an adverse impact on our financial results in the period in which the loss is recognized.In addition, if the demand for our solar products decreases, our manufacturing capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to record an impairment on our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, which would increase our expenses. In improving our manufacturing processes consistent with our cost reduction roadmap, we could write off equipment that is removed from the manufacturing process. In addition, if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, and cause us to accelerate depreciation. Each of the above events would adversely affect our future financial results.Fluctuations in Solar Renewable Energy Credit prices may adversely impact our results of operations.We acquire Solar Renewable Energy Credits ("SRECs") in the ordinary course of business in New Jersey by agreeing in certain cases to purchase SRECs generated by a solar system we install for a specified period at specified pricing. We then sell the SRECs to utilities to help them meet their state renewable energy portfolio requirements, or to other third parties. SREC prices have decreased significantly in recent years as the supply of SRECs has increased. If SREC prices continue to fluctuate or remain lower than our purchase commitment prices, we may have to recognize losses, which will adversely impact our results of operations.A change in our anticipated foreign exchange transactions could affect the accounting of our foreign currency hedging program and adversely impact our revenues, margins, and results of operations.Our hedging program is designed to reduce our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. As a part of this program, we designate certain derivative transactions as effective cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency 35Table of Contentsrevenues and record the effective portion of changes in the fair value of such transactions in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the anticipated revenues have occurred, at which point the associated income or loss would be recognized in revenue. If we conclude that we have a pattern of determining that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur, we may no longer be able to continue to use hedge accounting in the future to reduce our exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. Such a conclusion and change in our foreign currency hedge program could adversely impact our revenue, margins and results of operations.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could adversely impact our business and results of operations. We have significant sales globally, and we are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily related to sales to European customers that are denominated in Euros. A depreciation of the Euro would adversely impact our margins on sales to European customers. When foreign currencies appreciate against the U.S. dollar, inventories and expenses denominated in foreign currencies become more expensive. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our solar power products more expensive for international customers, thus potentially leading to a reduction in demand, our sales and profitability. As a result, substantial unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we seek to reduce our currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where we deem it appropriate, we do not know whether our efforts will be successful. Because we hedge some of our expected future foreign exchange exposure, if associated revenues do not materialize, we could experience losses. In the past, we have experienced an adverse impact on our revenue, gross margin, cash position and profitability as a result of foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, any break-up of the Eurozone would disrupt our sales and supply chain, expose us to financial counterparty risk, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt financing to purchase our solar power systems. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our customers to obtain the financing necessary to purchase our solar power systems on favorable terms, or at all, and thus lower demand for our solar power products, reduce revenue and adversely impact our operating results. An increase in interest rates could lower a customer's return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems, which, in each case, could cause our customers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns or demand higher returns from our solar power systems, which could reduce our revenue and gross margin and adversely impact our operating results. Our interest expense would increase to the extent interest rates rise in connection with our variable interest rate borrowings. In addition, lower interest rates have an adverse impact on our interest income. See also Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels-The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements for our solar power plants, our residential lease program and our customers, and is affected by general economic conditions.” We are exposed to the credit risk of our financial counterparties, customers and suppliers. We have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk. These consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, notes receivable, advances to suppliers, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, bond hedge and warrant transactions, and purchased options. We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments. We enter into agreements with suppliers that specify future quantities and pricing of polysilicon to be supplied for periods up to 10 years. Under certain agreements, we are required to make significant prepayments to the vendors over the terms of the arrangements. We may be unable to recover such prepayments if the credit conditions of these suppliers materially deteriorate. In addition, we may not be able to collect from our customers in the event of the deterioration of their credit or if they enter into bankruptcy. Any of the preceding could materially and adversely impact our financial conditions, results of operations and liquidity. See also Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” We depend on third-party contract manufacturers to assemble a significant portion of our solar cells into solar panels and any failure to obtain sufficient assembly and test capacity could significantly delay our ability to ship our solar panels and damage our customer relationships. We outsource a portion of module manufacturing to contract manufacturers in the United States and China. As a result of outsourcing this final step in our production, we face several significant risks, including limited control over assembly and testing capacity, delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs. If the operations of our third-36Table of Contentsparty contract manufacturers were disrupted or its financial stability impaired, or if they were unable or unwilling to devote capacity to our solar panels in a timely manner, our business could suffer as we might be unable to produce finished solar panels on a timely basis. We also risk customer delays resulting from an inability to move module production to an alternate provider or to complete production internationally, and it may not be possible to obtain sufficient capacity or comparable production costs at another facility in a timely manner. In addition, migrating our design methodology to third-party contract manufacturers or to a captive panel assembly facility could involve increased costs, resources and development time, and utilizing additional third-party contract manufacturers could expose us to further risk of losing control over our intellectual property and the quality of our solar panels. Any reduction in the supply of solar panels could impair our revenue by significantly delaying our ability to ship products and potentially damage our relationships with new and existing customers, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.While we believe we currently have effective internal control over financial reporting, we may identify a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Our management is responsible for maintaining internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. While the Company had material weaknesses in fiscal 2009, management remediated these material weaknesses, and concluded that as of January 1, 2012 and December 30, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. We need to continuously maintain our internal control processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes. This process is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Furthermore, as we grow our business or acquire other businesses, our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, either in our existing business or in businesses that we may acquire, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline.Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or The Nasdaq Global Select Market. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. We and certain of our current and former officers and directors have been named as parties to various lawsuits relating to our past Audit Committee accounting investigation, and may be named in further litigation, including with respect to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, all of which could require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer. Three securities class action lawsuits were filed against our Company and certain of our current and former officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a class consisting of those who acquired our securities from April 17, 2008, through November 16, 2009. The actions arise from our announcement on November 16, 2009, that our Audit Committee commenced an internal investigation regarding certain unsubstantiated accounting entries. The complaints allege that the defendants made material misstatements and omissions concerning our financial results for 2008 and 2009, seek an unspecified amount of damages, and allege violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. These cases were consolidated as In re SunPower Securities Litigation, Case No. CV-09-5473-RS (N.D. Cal.), and an amended complaint was filed on April 18, 2011. The amended complaint added two former employees as defendants. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and on December 19, 2011, the court dismissed the claims brought pursuant to sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and the claims brought against the two newly added former employees. In addition, derivative actions purporting to be brought on our behalf have also been filed in state and federal courts against several of our current and former officers and directors based on the same events alleged in the securities class action lawsuits described above. The California state derivative complaints assert state-law claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, unjust enrichment, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. The federal derivative complaints assert state-law claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate 37Table of Contentsassets, and unjust enrichment. The Delaware state derivative complaint asserts state-law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and contribution and indemnification. The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages. On December 14, 2012, we announced that an agreement in principle was reached to settle the consolidated securities class action lawsuit for $19.7 million. On February 1, 2013, the parties filed a stipulation of settlement and a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. The motion is noticed to be heard on March 14, 2013. The settlement is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the court after members of the proposed settlement class receive notice and an opportunity to be heard. Until the conditions to the settlement have been satisfied, there can be no assurance that the settlement will become final. Other risks and uncertainties include the extent to which individual claimants opt out of the settlement class and pursue individual claims; our ability to overcome any objections or appeals regarding the settlement; and our ability to absorb the cost of the settlement and the timing of the impact on financial statements.We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits. The matters which led to our Audit Committee's investigation and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. We and our current and former officers and directors may, in the future, be subject to additional private and governmental actions relating to such matters. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former officers and directors in connection with such lawsuits and governmental investigations and any related litigation or settlements amounts. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits, and any other litigation that may be brought against us or our current or former officers and directors, could be time-consuming, result in significant expense and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees. An unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could exceed coverage provided under potentially applicable insurance policies, which is limited. Any such unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we could be required to pay damages or additional penalties or have other remedies imposed against us, or our current or former directors or officers, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, our Company is largely self insured for these claims so that expenses, settlements or damages in excess of $5 million in these actions will not be recoverable under the primary coverage insurance policies. Moreover, such policies are subject to several terms, conditions and exclusions. See also "Risks Related to Our Liquidity - Because we self-insure for certain indemnities we have made to our officers and directors, potential claims could materially and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations." We may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our relationship with Total.We and Total S.A., parent of Total Gas & Power USA SAS ("Total"), have entered into a Credit Support Agreement under which Total S.A. has agreed to enter into one or more guarantee agreements with banks providing letter of credit facilities to us in support of certain of our businesses and other permitted purposes. Total S.A. will guarantee the payment to the applicable issuing bank of our obligation to reimburse a draw on a letter of credit and pay interest thereon in accordance with the letter of credit facility between such bank and us. In consideration for the commitments of Total S.A., we are required to pay Total S.A. a guarantee fee for each letter of credit that is the subject of a guaranty, starting at 1% and increasing to 2.35% in the fifth year following the completion of the tender offer. We entered into a letter of credit facility agreement with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch in August 2011 supported by a Total S.A. guarantee. We have also entered into the Liquidity Support Facility, under which Total S.A. has agreed to provide up to $600 million of liquidity support in the event that our then-current or projected unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity is reduced below $100 million or we are not in compliance with any financial covenant contained in our indebtedness.We and Total have also entered into a Research & Collaboration Agreement that establishes a framework under which we engage in long-term research and development collaboration with Total. The Research & Collaboration Agreement is expected to encompass a number of different projects, with a focus on advancing technologies in the area of photovoltaics. We may not realize the expected benefits of these agreements in a timely manner, or at all. The Credit Support Agreement can provide guarantees to our letter of credit facility, but not our other indebtedness. As the guarantee fee goes up over time, it may not be price competitive for us to continue to utilize the guarantee under the Credit Support Agreement and we may choose not to do so, which may cause our lenders to seek cash collateral. If the credit quality of Total S.A. were to deteriorate, then the guarantees would not be as beneficial to our lenders, which could reduce their willingness to lend to us and raise our costs of borrowing. We could incur additional expenses related to the Credit Support Agreement, especially relating to the guarantee fee. The Liquidity Support Facility may cause potential dilution to our other stockholders through the issuance of equity, warrants, and convertible debt securities to Total S.A. and its affiliates. The amount of support Total S.A. must provide under the Liquidity Support Facility is limited to $600 million. On December 24, 2012, Total S.A. agreed to guarantee our revolving credit facility with Credit Agricole, which reduced the capacity available under the Liquidity Support Facility by $275 million. Finally, the Liquidity Support Facility will no longer be available, and all outstanding debt under the Liquidity 38Table of ContentsSupport Facility (excluding the guarantee provided by Total S.A. under the revolving credit facility with Credit Agricole) will become due, upon the completion of CVSR, which we expect to occur before the end of fiscal 2013. We may have difficulties in fully leveraging the research and development efforts of Total while protecting our intellectual property rights and our long term strategic interests. Further, the collaboration envisioned by the parties from the Research & Collaboration Agreement could be subject to governmental controls that could limit the full set of benefits. In addition, we are a U.S.-based, high growth, technology and alternative energy company, while Total S.A. is a more mature and much larger French diversified energy company. The resulting differences in our organizational cultures may prevent us from fully realizing the anticipated benefits from our relationship. If we have a potential conflict with Total, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. Such disagreements may relate to any determination with respect to mergers and other business combinations, our acquisition or disposition of assets, our financing activities, allocation of business opportunities, employee retention or recruiting.Our agreements with Cypress Semiconductor Corporation ("Cypress") require us to indemnify Cypress for certain tax liabilities. These indemnification obligations and related contractual restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain business initiatives. On October 6, 2005, while a subsidiary of Cypress, our former parent company, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Cypress providing for each party's obligations concerning various tax liabilities. The tax sharing agreement is structured such that Cypress would pay all federal, state, local and foreign taxes that are calculated on a consolidated or combined basis while we were a member of Cypress's consolidated or combined group for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes. Our portion of tax liabilities or benefits was determined based upon our separate return tax liability as defined under the tax sharing agreement. These tax liabilities or benefits were based on a pro forma calculation as if we were filing a separate income tax return in each jurisdiction, rather than on a combined or consolidated basis, subject to adjustments as set forth in the tax sharing agreement. On June 6, 2006, we ceased to be a member of Cypress's consolidated group for federal income tax purposes and certain state income tax purposes. On September 29, 2008, we ceased to be a member of Cypress's combined group for all state income tax purposes. To the extent that we become entitled to utilize our separate portion of any tax credit or loss carryforwards existing as of such date, we will distribute to Cypress the tax effect, estimated to be 40% for federal and state income tax purposes, of the amount of such tax loss carryforwards so utilized, and the amount of any credit carryforwards so utilized. We will distribute these amounts to Cypress in cash or in our shares, at Cypress's option. As of December 30, 2012, we have a potential future liability of approximately $2.2 million that may be due under this arrangement. In both fiscal 2012 and 2011, we did not make any cash payments to Cypress related to this arrangement. We were jointly and severally liable for any tax liability during all periods in which we were deemed to be a member of the Cypress consolidated or combined group. Accordingly, although the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities between Cypress and all its consolidated subsidiaries, for any period in which we were included in Cypress's consolidated or combined group, we could be liable in the event that any federal or state tax liability was incurred, but not discharged, by any other member of the group. We will continue to be jointly and severally liable to Cypress until the statute of limitations runs or all appeal options are exercised for all years in which we joined in the filing of tax returns with Cypress. If Cypress experiences adjustments to their tax liability pursuant to tax examinations, we may incur an incremental liability. We would also be liable to Cypress for taxes that might arise from the distribution by Cypress of our former class B common stock to Cypress's stockholders on September 29, 2008, or "spin-off". In connection with Cypress's spin-off of our former class B common stock, we and Cypress, on August 12, 2008, entered into an amendment to our tax sharing agreement (“Amended Tax Sharing Agreement”) to address certain transactions that may affect the tax treatment of the spin-off and certain other matters. Subject to certain caveats, Cypress obtained a ruling from the IRS to the effect that the distribution by Cypress of our former class B common stock to Cypress's stockholders qualified as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”). Despite such ruling, the distribution may nonetheless be taxable to Cypress under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more of the voting power or value of our stock was or is later acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution of our stock. The Amended Tax Sharing Agreement requires us to indemnify Cypress for any liability incurred as a result of issuances or dispositions of our stock after the distribution, other than liability 39Table of Contentsattributable to certain dispositions of our stock by Cypress, that cause Cypress's distribution of shares of our stock to its stockholders to be taxable to Cypress under Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the Amended Tax Sharing Agreement, we also agreed that, until October 29, 2010, we would not effect a conversion of any or all of our former class B common stock to former class A common stock or any similar recapitalization transaction or series of related transactions (a “Recapitalization”). On November 16, 2011, we reclassified our former class A common stock and class B common stock into a single class of common stock. In the event this reclassification does result in the spin-off being treated as taxable, we could face substantial liabilities as a result of our obligations under the Amended Tax Sharing Agreement.Any future agreements with Total S.A. regarding tax indemnification and certain tax liabilities may adversely impact our financial position.We currently believe that we will not join in tax filings on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with Total S.A. Accordingly, no tax sharing arrangement is currently in place. If we and Total join in a tax filing in the future, a tax sharing agreement will be required, which would allocate the tax liabilities among the parties and may adversely impact our financial position. Our headquarters and manufacturing facilities, as well as the facilities of certain subcontractors and suppliers, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters, and climate change and climate change regulation could have an adverse effect on our operations. Our headquarters and research and development operations are located in California, and our manufacturing facilities are located in the Philippines, France, South Africa and Mexico. The facilities of our joint venture for manufacturing is located in Malaysia. Any significant earthquake, tsunami or other natural disaster in these countries or countries where our suppliers are located could materially disrupt our management operations and/or our production capabilities, and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery, or substantial shortage, of our products and services. In addition, legislators, regulators, and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce green-house gas emissions. Further regulation could be forthcoming at the federal or state level with respect to green-house gas emissions. Such regulation or similar regulations in other countries could result in regulatory or product standard requirements for our global business, including our manufacturing operations. Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations may include changes in weather patterns (including floods, tsunamis, drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, production, sales and financial performance of our operations. We could be adversely affected by any violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and foreign anti-bribery laws. The U.S. FCPA generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Other countries in which we operate also have anti-bribery laws, some of which prohibit improper payments to government and non-government persons and entities. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We continue to acquire businesses outside of the United States and operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In addition, due to the level of regulation in our industry, our entry into new jurisdictions through internal growth or acquisitions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from U.S. standards. While we implement policies and procedures and conduct training designed to facilitate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, thereby mitigating the risk of violations of such laws, our employees, subcontractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and anti-bribery laws. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. We sell our solar products to agencies of the U.S. government, and as a result, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations, and our business could be adversely affected by an audit by the U.S. government if it were to identify errors or a failure to comply with regulations. We have sold and continue to sell our solar power systems to various U.S. government agencies. In connection with these contracts, we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, which may impose added costs on our business. We are expected to perform in 40Table of Contentscompliance with a vast array of federal laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Federal False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Act of 1986, the Trade Agreements Act, the Buy American Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, and the Davis Bacon Act. A violation of specific laws and regulations, even if prohibited by our policies, could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, reductions of the value of our contracts, contract modifications or termination, or suspension or debarment from government contracting for a period of time. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. government may terminate any of our government contracts either at its convenience or for default based on performance. A termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts. U.S. government agencies may audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, we could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines. We are required to comply with all foreign, U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding pollution control and protection of the environment. In addition, under some statutes and regulations, a government agency, or other parties, may seek recovery and response costs from operators of property where releases of hazardous substances have occurred or are ongoing, even if the operator was not responsible for such release or otherwise at fault. We use, generate and discharge toxic, volatile and otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our research and development and manufacturing activities. Any failure by us to control the use of, or to restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions in our business operations. In addition, if more stringent laws and regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations could be substantial. To date such laws and regulations have not had a significant impact on our operations, and we believe that we have all necessary permits to conduct operations as they are presently conducted. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental laws and regulations, however, we may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. In addition, new U.S. legislation includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of "conflict" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict” minerals. The implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of solar products. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free minerals, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products. Our success depends on the continuing contributions of our key personnel. We rely heavily on the services of our key executive officers and the loss of services of any principal member of our management team could adversely impact our operations. In addition, we anticipate that we will need to hire a number of highly skilled technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing, administrative and accounting personnel. Due to the current economic environment, we have conducted several restructurings, which may negatively affect our ability to execute our strategy and business model. The competition for qualified personnel is intense in our industry. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to support our anticipated growth. We cannot guarantee that any employee will remain employed with us for any definite period of time since all of our employees, including our key executive officers, serve at-will and may terminate their employment at any time for any reason. We may in the future be required to consolidate the assets, liabilities and financial results of certain of our existing or future joint ventures, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, gross margin and operating results. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued accounting guidance regarding variable interest entities ("VIEs") that affects our accounting treatment of our existing and future joint ventures. We have variable interests in AUOSP, our joint venture with AUO. To ascertain if we are required to consolidate these entities, we determine whether these entities are VIEs and if we are the primary beneficiary in accordance with the accounting guidance. Factors we consider in determining whether 41Table of Contentswe are the VIE's primary beneficiary include the decision making authority of each partner, which partner manages the day-to-day operations of the joint venture and each partner's obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the joint venture in relation to that of the other partner. Changes in the financial accounting guidance, or changes in circumstances at each of these joint ventures, could lead us to determine that we have to consolidate the assets, liabilities and financial results of such joint ventures. The consolidation of AUOSP would significantly increase our indebtedness. Consolidation of our VIEs could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, gross margin and operating results. In addition, we may enter into future joint ventures or make other equity investments, which could have an adverse impact on us because of the financial accounting guidance regarding VIEs. Risks Related to Our Intellectual PropertyWe are dependent on our intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in the loss of significant rights.From time to time, we, our respective customers, or third parties with whom we work may receive letters, including letters from various industry participants, alleging infringement of their patents. Although we are not currently aware of any parties pursuing or intending to pursue infringement claims against us, we cannot assure investors that we will not be subject to such claims in the future. Additionally, we are required by contract to indemnify some of our customers and our third-party intellectual property providers for certain costs and damages of patent infringement in circumstances where our products are a factor creating the customer's or these third-party providers' infringement liability. This practice may subject us to significant indemnification claims by our customers and our third-party providers. We cannot assure investors that indemnification claims will not be made or that these claims will not harm our business, operating results or financial condition. Intellectual property litigation is very expensive and time-consuming and could divert management's attention from our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, our customers or our third-party intellectual property providers, we may be required to pay substantial damages to the party claiming infringement, stop selling products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Parties making infringement claims may also be able to bring an action before the International Trade Commission that could result in an order stopping the importation into the United States of our solar products. Any of these judgments could materially damage our business. We may have to develop non-infringing technology, and our failure in doing so or in obtaining licenses to the proprietary rights on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.We have filed, and may continue to file, claims against other parties for infringing our intellectual property that may be very costly and may not be resolved in our favor.To protect our intellectual property rights and to maintain our competitive advantage, we have, and may continue to, file suits against parties who we believe infringe our intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management's attention from our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition, and our enforcement efforts may not be successful. In addition, the validity of our patents may be challenged in such litigation. Our participation in intellectual property enforcement actions may negatively impact our financial results.We rely substantially upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenue could suffer.We seek to protect our proprietary manufacturing processes, documentation and other written materials primarily under trade secret and copyright laws. We also typically require employees, consultants, and third parties such as our vendors and customers, with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements. The steps taken by us to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology. Our systems may be subject to intrusions, security breaches, or targeted theft of our trade secrets. In addition, our proprietary rights may not be adequately protected because:people may not be deterred from misappropriating our technologies despite the existence of laws or contracts prohibiting it;policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, the remedy obtained may be inadequate to restore protection of our intellectual property, and moreover, we may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use;42Table of Contentsthe laws of other countries in which we market our solar products, such as some countries in the Asia/Pacific region, may offer little or no protection for our proprietary technologies; andreports we file in connection with government-sponsored research contracts are generally available to the public and third parties may obtain some aspects of our sensitive confidential information.Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without compensating us for doing so. We also have formed the joint venture to manufacture our solar cells at AUOSP, and signed a joint venture agreement with partners in China with respect to our C-7 Tracker technology. Our joint venture partners may not be deterred from misappropriating our proprietary technologies despite contractual and other legal restrictions. Legal protection in countries where our joint ventures are located may not be robust and enforcement by us of our intellectual property rights may be difficult. As a result, our joint venture partners could directly compete with our business. Any such activities or any other inabilities to adequately protect our proprietary rights could harm our ability to compete, to generate revenue and to grow our business.We may not obtain sufficient patent protection on the technology embodied in the solar products we currently manufacture and market, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses.Although we substantially rely on trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect the technology in the solar products we currently manufacture and market, our success and ability to compete in the future may also depend to a significant degree upon obtaining patent protection for our proprietary technology. We currently own multiple patents and patent applications which cover aspects of the technology in the solar cells and mounting systems that we currently manufacture and market. Material patents that relate to our systems products and services primarily relate to our rooftop mounting products and ground-mounted tracking products. We intend to continue to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs, and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages.Our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and even if they result in issued patents, the patents may not have claims of the scope we seek or we may have to refile patent applications due to newly discovered prior art. In addition, any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated, or declared unenforceable, or even if we obtain an award of damages for infringement by a third party, such award could prove insufficient to compensate for all damages incurred as a result of such infringement. The earliest term of any issued patents would be 20 years from their earliest priority date and if our applications are pending for a long time period, we may have a correspondingly shorter term for any patent that may issue. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may be insufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. For example, competitors could develop similar or more advantageous technologies on their own or design around our patents. Also, patent protection in certain foreign countries may not be available or may be limited in scope and any patents obtained may not be as readily enforceable as in the United States, making it difficult for us to effectively protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by other companies in these countries. Our inability to obtain and enforce our intellectual property rights in some countries may harm our business. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.We may not be able to prevent others from using the term SunPower or similar terms in connection with their solar power products which could adversely affect the market recognition of our name and our revenue."SunPower" and the "SunPower" logo are our registered trademark in certain countries, including the United States, for uses that include solar cells and solar panels. We are seeking registration of the "SunPower" trademark in other countries but we may not be successful in some of these jurisdictions. We hold registered trademarks for SunPower®, SunPower Electric®, Maxeon®, Oasis®, PowerGuard®, PowerLight®, Serengeti®, and SunTile®, in certain countries, including the United States. We have not registered, and may not be able to register, these trademarks in other key countries. In the foreign jurisdictions where we are unable to obtain or have not tried to obtain registrations, others may be able to sell their products using trademarks compromising or incorporating "SunPower," or a variation thereof, or our other chosen brands, which could lead to customer confusion. In addition, if there are jurisdictions where another proprietor has already established trademark rights in marks containing "SunPower," or our other chosen brands, we may face trademark disputes and may have to market our products with other trademarks or without our trademarks, which may undermine our marketing efforts. We may encounter trademark disputes with companies using marks which are confusingly similar to the SunPower mark, or our other marks, which if not resolved favorably, could cause our branding efforts to suffer. In addition, we may have difficulty in establishing strong brand recognition with consumers if others use similar marks for similar products. 43Table of ContentsOur past reliance on government programs to partially fund our research and development programs could impair our ability to commercialize our solar power products and services.Government funding of some of our research and development efforts imposed certain restrictions on our ability to commercialize results and could grant commercialization rights to the government. In some funding awards, the government is entitled to intellectual property rights arising from the related research. Such rights include a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced each subject invention developed under an award throughout the world by or on behalf of the government. Other rights include the right to require us to grant a license to the developed technology or products to a third party or, in some cases, if we refuse, the government may grant the license itself, if the government determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give the United States industry preference. Accepting government funding can also require that manufacturing of products developed with federal funding be conducted in the United States.We may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions that could damage our business operations, financial conditions, or reputation.We may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could result in delayed or canceled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing, and financial reporting.We may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could lead to disclosure of our internal information, or could damage our reputation or relationships with dealers and customers, or could disrupt access to our online services. Such breaches could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.Our business requires us to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information ("PII"). This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. Malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many companies across various industries, including ours.We use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. We devote resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. We may experience a breach of our systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. We could also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which could result in a detrimental effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.We are subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between one company and its subsidiaries, and among the subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices. Noncompliance could result in penalties or legal liability.A failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with a posted privacy policies or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, which could have a detrimental effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.44Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Debt and Equity SecuritiesTotal's majority ownership of our common stock may adversely affect the liquidity and value of our common stock. As of December 30, 2012, Total owned approximately 66% of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the Affiliation Agreement between us and Total, the Board of Directors of SunPower includes five designees from Total, giving Total majority control of our Board. As a result, subject to the restrictions in the Affiliation Agreement, Total possesses significant influence and control over our affairs. Our non-Total stockholders have reduced ownership and voting interest in our company and, as a result, have less influence over the management and policies of our company than they exercised prior to Total's tender offer. As long as Total controls us, the ability of our other stockholders to influence matters requiring stockholder approval is limited. Total's stock ownership and relationships with members of our Board of Directors could have the effect of preventing minority stockholders from exercising significant control over our affairs, delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, limiting our financing options. These factors in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price of our common stock. The Affiliation Agreement limits Total and any member of the Total affiliated companies ("Total Group") from effecting, seeking, or entering into discussions with any third party regarding any transaction that would result in the Total Group beneficially owning our shares in excess of certain thresholds during a standstill period. The Affiliation Agreement also imposes certain limitations on the Total Group's ability to seek to affect a tender offer or merger to acquire 100% of our outstanding voting power. Such provisions may not be successful in preventing the Total Group from engaging in transactions which further increase their ownership and negatively impact the price of our common stock. In connection with our acquisition of Tenesol and our entry into the Liquidity Support Facility, we agreed to exempt the shares issued in connection with those transactions from the ownership limitations imposed by the Affiliation Agreement, so that Total may own up to the stated limits plus any such shares. In return for providing certain guarantees or other support, as was the case with the Liquidity Support Agreement, Total may request additional equity to be issued to it or its affiliates, or it may convert previously issued convertible debt into equity or exercise previously granted warrants, potentially at a discount or at a smaller premium than our other stockholders would prefer, which may lead to additional dilution to our stockholders. Due to the pricing of the equity compensation elements of the Liquidity Support Facility, the degree of dilution to our other stockholders will tend to increase to the extent that we require more support and to the extent that our stock price decreases. See also "Risks Related to Our Liquidity--Due to the general economic environment, the continued market pressure driving down the average selling prices of our solar power products, and other factors, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments as planned." Finally, the market for our common stock has become less liquid and more thinly traded as a result of the Total tender offer. The lower number of shares available to be traded could result in greater volatility in the price of our common stock and affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms in the capital markets. Conversion of our outstanding 4.75% debentures, our warrants related to our outstanding 4.50% and 4.75% debentures, and future substantial issuances or dispositions of our common stock or other securities, could dilute ownership and earnings per share or cause the market price of our stock to decrease. To the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of our outstanding 4.75% debentures, the conversion of some or all of such debentures will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their debentures. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Sales of our common stock in the public market or sales of any of our other securities could dilute ownership and earnings per share, and even the perception that such sales could occur could cause the market prices of our common stock to decline. In addition, the existence of our outstanding debentures may encourage short selling of our common stock by market participants who expect that the conversion of the debentures could depress the prices of our common stock. We issued warrants to affiliates of the underwriters of our 4.50% and 4.75% debentures, which are exercisable for a total of approximately 11.1 million shares and 8.7 million shares of our common stock, respectively. The warrants, together with certain convertible hedge transactions, are meant to reduce our exposure upon potential conversion of our 4.50% and 4.75% debentures. If the market price of our common stock exceeds the respective exercise prices of the warrants, such warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, and could dilute the ownership interests for existing stockholders if exercised. The price of our common stock, and therefore of our outstanding 0.75%, 4.50%, and 4.75% debentures, may fluctuate significantly. 45Table of ContentsOur common stock has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to further wide fluctuations due to many factors, including the factors discussed in this risk factors section. In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the securities of technology companies and solar companies in particular, have experienced severe price and volume fluctuations. These trading prices and valuations, including our own market valuation and those of companies in our industry generally, may not be sustainable. These broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Because the 0.75%, 4.50%, and 4.75% debentures are convertible into our common stock (and/or cash equivalent to the value of our common stock), volatility or depressed prices of our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of these debentures. Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions, our outstanding 0.75%, 4.50%, and 4.75% debentures provide for a right to convert upon certain events, and our Board of Directors entered into a rights agreement and declared a rights dividend, any of which could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable. Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:the right of the Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors;the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;the requirement for advance notice for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting;the ability of the Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 10.0 million shares of preferred stock with terms set by the Board of Directors, which rights could be senior to those of common stock;our Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors, with the classes to be as nearly equal in number as possible;stockholders may not call special meetings of the stockholders, except by Total under limited circumstances;our Board of Directors is able to alter our by-laws without obtaining stockholder approval.Certain provisions of our outstanding debentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, including an entity becoming the beneficial owner of 75% of our voting stock (such as Total), holders of our outstanding debentures will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase, at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the debentures, all or a portion of their debentures. We may also be required to issue additional shares of our common stock upon conversion of such debentures in the event of certain fundamental changes. In addition, we entered into a Rights Agreement with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., commonly referred to as a "poison pill," which could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.46Table of ContentsITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.
