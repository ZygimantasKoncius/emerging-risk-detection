Industry Background Growth in the semiconductor industry is driven by the global demand for semiconductor devices that are incorporated in a broad array of electronics devices such as personal computers, network servers, digital televisions, audio systems including MP3 players, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, GPS devices and other wireless communications devices. The market for semiconductor equipment used to fabricate semiconductor devices has also experienced significant growth, driven by greater demand for, and increasingly higher performance of, semiconductor devices. Though subject to a high degree of cyclicality due to periods of excess supply or demand for semiconductor equipment, semiconductor devices and semiconductor fab capacity utilization, the market for semiconductor equipment is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation. As a result, to meet new technological advancements, semiconductor device manufacturers may purchase new semiconductor equipment despite the timing of the market cycle. Semiconductor Manufacturing Process Overview Semiconductor devices consist of millions of microscopic transistors and other components that electronically store information and allow the execution of instructions used to operate electronic devices. Fabrication of ICs involves hundreds of complex and repetitive process steps, involving an array of sophisticated manufacturing equipment, chemical media, and materials. The fabrication process includes, among others, the deposition of multiple layers of dielectric or insulating films and electrically conducting metal films. After the deposition of each film layer, the fabrication process continues with repeated cleaning, stripping and etching processes to prepare the surface for the next process. When completed, the wafer may contain several hundred ICs, which are traditionally then separated by a dicing process. The ICs are then packaged by connecting them to pins using metal wires or contacts and encapsulating the ICs in a polymer. In an effort to reduce the size of packaged ICs, some manufacturers are using newer packaging processes such as wafer level packaging, which allows for packaging of ICs before they are singularized. The packaged semiconductor devices can then be placed into an electronic product, such as a cellular phone or other portable electronic device. Cleaning, stripping, etching or otherwise preparing the wafer surface are steps repeated throughout the semiconductor fabrication process as well as in the wafer level packaging process. These processes are important, since the integrity of the next process depends on the effectiveness of prior cleaning, stripping, or etching steps. Immersion and spray are two fundamental means by which surface preparation wet process steps are performed. Immersion processes, or wet benches, are a series of liquid-filled tanks in which wafers are immersed. The wafers are transported from one tank to another tank by robots or human operators. Spray delivery systems subject wafers to sequential spray applications of chemicals inside an enclosed process chamber, where the chemical is brought to the wafers while the wafers rotate on axis. Spray systems can be configured to process wafers in a batch or single-wafer mode. Single-wafer processor systems can provide a combination of spray and immersion processes. 4 An ICs interconnect wiring establishes the connections between transistors within an IC to external devices. Interconnects are formed by the deposition of metal film layers, such as copper, on the surface of a wafer. The deposition step occurs numerous times throughout the manufacturing process, with advanced ICs possessing seven or more metal film layers. As device dimensions continue to shrink, the connections between transistors add noticeably more delay to IC processing speeds, due to the intrinsic resistance and capacitance of the interconnect material. Copper is the material of choice in such situations and practically all 300mm fabs use copper plating equipment. However, copper, unlike aluminum, is difficult to handle due to a negative reaction in direct contact with silicon, which leads to lower yield and potentially contaminates other manufacturing processes. As a result, copper-based manufacturing requires more critical surface preparation steps and special processing techniques to provide complete isolation of the copper material. Trends in Semiconductor Manufacturing There are several key trends in the semiconductor manufacturing industry driving growth in demand for wafer surface preparation, ECD and other advanced semiconductor equipment: Smaller Device Features for Lower Cost and Higher Performance. Semiconductor device size has followed Moores Law which states that on average every 18 months a device doubles in power and shrinks 50%. The continuing trend towards more advanced electronics applications has spurred the industrys transition to smaller device features, enabling lower cost per IC, as more ICs can be fabricated on each wafer. Additionally, smaller device features operate at higher speeds and require less power. As the industry moves to 65 nanometer feature sizes and below, the IC fabrication process becomes significantly more complex, requiring more stringent manufacturing specifications and lower acceptable margins of error. In particular, the fabrication process becomes more susceptible to ever smaller particles, requiring the use of more advanced surface preparation equipment. Also, manufacturing smaller IC interconnects often requires the use of equipment specifically designed for copper processing. New Materials to Fabricate More Advanced Semiconductor Devices. The need to fabricate increasingly advanced semiconductor devices has led to more complex manufacturing processes that use new materials, such as low-k dielectrics and copper to form an ICs interconnect. The use of copper, in particular, presents significant processing challenges to prevent copper contamination measured in quantities at the atomic level. To address these challenges, dedicated processes have been developed to provide better isolation of copper materials on an IC, including dual-damascene, barrier layer formation, and new cleaning processes to remove unwanted copper. These complex, dedicated processes require the use of equipment for the precise deposition of copper material. Additionally, the introduction of new materials requires a higher number of surface preparation steps, as well as more advanced cleaning processes that are tailored to handle these new materials. Increased Use of 300mm Wafers to Reduce Manufacturing Costs. Leading semiconductor device manufacturers are investing in 300mm wafer fabs. The 125% more surface area of 300mm compared to 200mm wafers has led to higher manufacturing efficiency and lower cost per IC due to the economies of scale that IC manufacturers achieve by processing additional die per wafer. Processing a larger surface area requires an additional level of control and precision, which necessitates the purchase of semiconductor equipment that is specifically targeted for the processing of 300mm wafers. Move to Single-Wafer Spray and Immersion Processing Technologies for Enhanced Surface Preparation. The industry shift towards smaller device dimensions, new materials and 300mm wafer processing has driven the need for more advanced surface preparation technologies and process equipment. In particular, 300mm is causing a move to single-wafer processing as the process can be controlled more precisely compared to wet bench technology. For example, single-wafer spray processing is increasingly being used instead of wet benches due to its greater process control, reduced footprint and reduced chemical consumption. Wafer Level and Other Advanced Packaging Enable Smaller Portable Products. New packaging technologies, including wafer level packaging, are being developed by the industry to enable smaller portable products such as GPSs, MP3 players, mobile phones and radio frequency identification, or RFID, tags. Advanced packaging is an enabling technology for the semiconductor industry, as it allows the integration of more computing and information processing power in a smaller space than conventional packaging technology. Advanced packaging uses fabrication processes similar to IC fabrication and includes, among others, ECD for connective solder or gold bumps, photoresist stripping and under-bump metal etching. Emerging Need for Thinner Wafers Driven by the Demand for Smaller Portable Devices. The desire for smaller, lighter and more power efficient devices has led to the need for thinning the device prior to packaging. Another emerging trend is 3-D device stacking for more functionality in a smaller space. This process is also enhanced by first thinning the device. The main problem with wafer thinning is yield loss due to stress caused by mechanically grinding the wafer surface. This process is also labor intensive. Chemically milling the wafer, which can be automated, has emerged as a method to achieve stress-free thin wafers. 5 Semitools Solution We are a leading provider of wet chemical processing equipment, targeting wafer surface preparation and ECD plating applications.

For electroplating applications, we leverage our advanced techniques in the design of our proprietary copper pellet anode assemblies and membrane technology to provide low cost copper to the flash and memory markets. Our multiple anode assemblies enable radially controlled current density during the electroplating process, leading to a more controllable process for depositing copper film on the surface of a wafer allowing the optimal match of the copper film to the planning characteristics of the downstream CMP process step. Products Our broad product suite of highly-sophisticated, innovative processing systems leverages our core wet chemical processing expertise and our years of experience in manufacturing and supporting production-proven semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Our primary wet chemical processing solutions are single-wafer and batch cleaning, stripping and etching equipment and single-wafer plating equipment, primarily for the deposition of copper, lead or lead-free solder. Surface Preparation Products Our multi-chamber, single-wafer processing systems for wet cleaning, stripping and etching are designed with a linear arrangement of the processing chambers for high volume production and, like our ECD chambers, utilize the Raider platform. The platform modularity reduces downtime and increases wafer throughput providing the customer with an overall lower cost of ownership. These systems are available to accommodate 200mm and 300mm wafer sizes. During the year, we shipped Raider SP units with our Nano-Megs technology, which allows the use of a megasonic device to clean the wafer surface without damage to the nano-sized features of the ICs. We also shipped single-wafer tools capable of providing our HydrOzone process for more cost effective cleans of the wafer surface.

The following is a representative list of our largest customers in fiscal 2006: Advanced Micro Devices Amkor Anadigics Atmel Casio Cree Cypress Semiconductor Freescale Semiconductor Hitachi Infineon Intel Magic Technologies Micron/IM Flash/Tech National Semiconductor Nepes Qimonda Semiconductor Mfg. Intl. Corp Spansion STMicroelectronics Texas Instruments United Microelectronics Corporation Our top ten customers accounted for 54.0%, 58.2% and 56.9% of net sales in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Advanced Micro Devices accounted for 13.8% and 16.7% of net sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. No customer accounted for over 10% of net sales in fiscal 2004. International sales, primarily in Europe, Asia and Japan, accounted for approximately 62.5%, 72.7 % and 51.8% of net sales for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The relative proportion of international sales to total net sales increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to increasing shipments of our Raider systems to Asia after declining in fiscal 2004 because initial shipments of the Raider systems, and our licensing fees, were in North America. We have direct sales and customer support organizations located in the United States, Europe, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan and China, and for some products, we utilize on a selective basis both independent representatives and distributors. We are currently expanding our direct sales and service organizations in Taiwan and China. Field service personnel and process engineers located in the United States, Europe, Japan and Asia provide warranty service, post-warranty service and equipment installation. We also provide service and maintenance training, as well as process application training for our customers personnel, on a fee basis. Spare parts inventories are maintained in outsourced locations throughout the world, which allows us to offer same day or overnight delivery in many instances. Backlog and Deferred Revenue Consolidated orders backlog was $85.3 million as of September 30, 2006. We include in backlog those customer orders for which we have written customer authorization and for which shipment is scheduled within the next 12 months. Orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers with limited or no cancellation fees. During periods of downturns in the semiconductor industry, we have experienced significant cancellations and delays. Our deferred revenue primarily relates to equipment shipped to customers that has not been accepted by the customer. Revenue on those shipments is recognized as sales when acceptance is received. As of September 30, 2006, deferred revenue was $14.4 million. As a result of systems ordered and shipped in the same quarter, possible changes in customer delivery dates, cancellations and shipment delays, and acceptances of shipped equipment carried in deferred revenue, the backlog at any particular date and the orders bookings for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any succeeding period. Manufacturing Most of our manufacturing is conducted at our facilities located near Kalispell, Montana. Our manufacturing operations are selectively vertically integrated to include metals and plastics fabrication and finishing capabilities, component parts and final product assembly, and extensive product development capabilities. Manufacturing personnel work closely with product development engineers to enhance manufacturability and facilitate the transition from prototype to full-scale production. Our high-volume manufacturing lines provide responsive lead time delivery of our products. Component and product prototyping typically is performed internally, reducing the time to market for new products and product enhancements. During the year we increased our manufacturing ability with the purchase of a 72,000 square foot facility near Kalispell. This building contains our fabrication departments and provides more space for the assembly area in our main facility. We also completed our facility in Salzburg, Austria which has space for light manufacturing and a repair facility. Research and Development We believe that timely development of products is necessary to remain competitive in an equipment market characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation. We devote significant resources to programs directed at developing new and enhanced products, as well as new applications for existing products. We maintain extensive demonstration and process development laboratories at our facilities in Montana, including three lab areas for demonstrating, testing and developing products. Research and development personnel work directly with customers, vendors, and research institutes to develop new processes and to design and evaluate new equipment. 9 Research and development, which is expensed as incurred, was approximately $24.5 million, $19.7 million and $15.1 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As a percentage of our net sales, these expenses represented approximately 10.1%, 10.4% and 10.8% in each of these fiscal years, respectively. Our research and development efforts were focused on the following projects which include FEOL cleaning applications, edge cleaning processes and equipment and integrated megasonic cleans. ECD R&D focused on the development of proprietary processes and power supply hardware to provide arbitrary wave form and dynamic current control for damascene plating, direct-on-barrier and thin seed layer processes, porous silicon processes and equipment and deep via applications. R&D projects also included mini-batch vacuum furnace/anneal and Thru Silicon Via (TSV) plating required for three dimensional chip stacking. During fiscal 2006, we and other semiconductor equipment companies and research institutes formed a consortium called EMC 3D, whose mission is to develop the processes and equipment needed for TSV technology. Competition The semiconductor equipment industry is an intensively competitive market place marked by constant technological change. Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment and related markets in which we compete include: system performance, quality and reliability, cost of using our equipment, ability to ship products to meet customer schedules, timeliness and quality of technical support service, our success in developing new and enhanced products, pricing and payment terms. We face substantial competition from established companies, some of which have greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources, broader and integrated product lines, more extensive customer support capabilities, larger sales organizations and greater installed customer bases. Our primary competitors in ECD include Applied Materials, Inc. and Novellus Systems, Inc. In wet surface preparation applications, our competition includes Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co., FSI International, Inc., SEZ Holding, AG and Tokyo Electron, Ltd. We believe that we compete favorably with these manufacturers. We may also face competition from new market entrants. Patents and Other Intellectual Property The semiconductor industry in general is very active in pursuing patent applications for both equipment and processes used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. Patents are considered important to the protection of intellectual property resulting from a companys research and development programs and are viewed as a means of gaining market advantages over competitors because the industry often differentiates competitors on the basis of technological criteria. We place a strong emphasis on the innovative features of our products and, where available, we generally seek patent protection for those features. We currently hold 322 U.S. patents, some with pending foreign counterparts, have approximately 193 U.S. patent applications pending and intend to file additional patent applications, as we deem appropriate. We have had an active patent program since the Companys inception; consequently, the duration of our patent portfolio is staggered due to various initial filing dates for individual patents. Our patent portfolio is not dominated by any particular patents. We consider the strength of the overall portfolio to be more important than the strength of any particular patent. In fact, many patents are part of our patent families and it is difficult, if not impossible, to make any assessment regarding the materiality of one patent in that family over another. Even if a patent is not used offensively to prevent a competitor from practicing the same art, it may still provide a deterrent against a competitors potential patent infringement claim against us. Employees As of September 30, 2006, we had 1,312 full-time and temporary employees worldwide. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike. We consider our employee relations to be good. Environmental Matters We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous waste. Our compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, and the remedial actions we have taken with respect to environmental regulations, have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 10 Executive Officers of the Registrant The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the executive officers of the Company: Name Age Position Raymon F.

Risk Factors Set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could also cause our stock price to decline. We have incurred significant net losses in the past, our future revenues are inherently unpredictable, and we may be unable to maintain profitability. We have incurred significant net losses in the past. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain the profitability that we achieved in the past three fiscal years. It is possible that in future quarters our operating results will decrease from the previous quarter or fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In this event, the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline. 11 Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will continue to vary significantly in the future, causing volatility in our stock price. Our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future, which will continue to cause our common stock price to fluctuate in the future. Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our common stock to price and volume fluctuations include: changes in customer demand for our systems, which is influenced by economic conditions, technological developments in the semiconductor industry, and the announcement or release of enhancements to existing products or new product offerings by our competitors; demand for products that use semiconductors; market acceptance of our systems and changes in our product offerings; size and timing of orders from customers; customer cancellations or delays in orders, shipments, and installations; customer delays or rejections of final acceptance of our shipments; changes in average selling price and product mix; failure to ship an anticipated number of systems in the quarter; product development costs, including research, development, engineering and marketing expenses associated with our introduction of new products and product enhancements; sudden changes in component prices or availability; manufacturing inefficiencies caused by uneven or unpredictable order patterns, reducing our gross margins; costs associated with protecting our intellectual property; level of our fixed expenses relative to our net sales; and fluctuating costs associated with our international organization and international sales; including currency exchange rate fluctuations. During any quarter, a significant portion of our net sales may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems. The selling prices of our systems range from under $700,000 to in excess of $4.7 million. Accordingly, a small change in the number and/or mix of tools we sell may cause significant changes in our operating results. Variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 (SAB 104) Revenue Recognition provides guidance on the recognition of revenue for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and product installation commitments. Timing of revenue recognition from the sale of new systems, sales to new customers and installation services is subject to the length of time required to achieve customer acceptance after shipment, which could cause our operating results to vary from period to period. In light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results. Moreover, many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term which, together with the need for continued investment in research and development, marketing and customer support, limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to declines in sales. As a result, net sales could decline and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could cause our operating results to be below the public market analysts or investors expectations and the market price of our stock could decline. Cyclicality in the semiconductor industry and the semiconductor equipment industry has historically led to substantial variations in demand for our products and consequently our operating results, and will continue to do so. Our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industrys business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which are difficult to predict. Our business depends upon the capital spending of semiconductor manufacturers, which, in turn, depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and manufacturing capacity, including capacity utilizing the latest technology. The rate of changes in demand, including end-user demand, is accelerating, and the effect of these changes on us is occurring sooner, exacerbating the volatility of these cycles. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology, and continue to affect our net sales, gross margin and results of operations. During downturns, the semiconductor equipment industry typically experiences a more pronounced percentage decrease in revenues than the semiconductor industry. A prolonged downturn can seriously affect our net sales, gross margin and results of operations. In addition, during downturns, it is critical to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, to minimize the effect of such downturns on our operations, and in particular, to continue to maintain our core research and development programs. If we are unable to align our cost structure in response to such downturns on a timely basis, or if such implementation has an adverse impact on our business, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected to an even larger extent during industry downturns. 12 Conversely, during an upturn or periods of increasing demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, we may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand. During an upturn we would be unable to predict the sustainability of a recovery, if any, and/or the industrys rate of growth in such a recovery, both of which will be affected by many factors. If we are unable to effectively manage our resources and production capacity during an industry upturn, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have experienced periods of rapid growth and decline in operating levels, and if we are not able to successfully manage these significant fluctuations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed. We have experienced periods of significant growth and decline in net sales. Our net sales increased 27.7% from approximately $190.4 million in fiscal 2005 to approximately $243.2 million in fiscal 2006. However, there have been periods of significant declines in net sales; for example, our net sales decreased 51.8% from approximately $256.5 million for fiscal 2001 to approximately $123.7 million for fiscal 2002. In addition, our consolidated orders backlog increased 39.2% from approximately $61.3 million at September 30, 2005 to $85.3 million at September 30, 2006. If we are unable to effectively manage periods of rapid decline or sales growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be significantly harmed. Our deferred revenue and orders backlog may not result in future net sales. Revenue recognition guidance requires that revenue and the associated profit from the sale of newly introduced systems, systems sales into new customer environments and substantive installation obligations that are subject to contractual customer acceptance provisions are deferred until the customer has acknowledged their acceptance of the system. If the system does not meet the agreed specifications and the customer refuses to accept the system, the deferred revenue and associated deferred profit will not be realized and we may be required to refund any cash payments previously received from the customer, which may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Order backlog does not necessarily include all sales needed to achieve net revenue expectations for a subsequent period. We schedule the production of our systems based in part upon order backlog. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. In addition, while we evaluate each customer order to determine qualification for inclusion in backlog, there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog will ultimately result in future sales. A reduction in backlog during any particular period, or the failure of our backlog to result in future sales, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our continued high spending levels on research and development and the need to maintain a high level of customer service and support may, under certain circumstances, harm our results of operations. In order to remain competitive, we must maintain a high level of investment in research and development, marketing and customer service while controlling operating expenses. Our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development as well as a high level of worldwide customer service and support. As a result of our need to maintain spending levels in these areas, our operating results could be materially harmed if our net sales fall below expectations. In addition, because of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation, our operating costs may increase further in the future, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flow in any given period. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make a high level of investment in research and development, marketing and customer service while controlling operating expenses or that our products will continue to be viewed as competitive as a result of technological advances by competitors or changes in semiconductor processing technology. Such competitive pressures may necessitate significant price reductions by us or result in lost orders, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We depend on our key customers with which we do not have long-term contracts. Any loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by, or failure to collect receivables from these customers could harm our business. Typically, we do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales. Sales are made pursuant to purchase orders, which can be cancelled or delayed by our customers at any time. Our customers are not required to make minimum purchases from us, or make purchases at any particular time; our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors; and our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty. 13 Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 54.0%, 58.2% and 56.9% of net sales in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There is a limited number of mostly large companies operating in the highly concentrated, capital intensive semiconductor industry. Accordingly, we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of large companies for a significant portion of our net sales. Although the composition of the group of largest customers may change from year to year, the loss of, or a significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of our key customers or the delay or cancellation of a large order could cause our net sales to decline significantly, which would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Similarly, delays in payments by large customers could have a significant impact on our cash flows. Intense competition in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our market share and reduce demand for our products. We face substantial competition from established competitors, some of which have: greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources; broader and integrated product lines; more extensive customer support capabilities; and larger sales organizations and customer bases. We may also face competition from new market entrants. Our ability to compete successfully in the future depends on a number of factors, including: system performance, quality and reliability; upfront price and maintenance costs of using our products; ability to ship products on time to meet customers' demands; timeliness and quality of technical support service; and our success in developing new and enhanced products. Due to intense competitive conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry, we have from time to time selectively reduced prices on our systems in order to protect our market share, and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions. Periodically, our competitors announce the introduction of new products or lower prices which can affect our customers decisions to purchase our systems, the prices we can charge for our systems and the level of discounts we grant our customers. Moreover, there has been significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors. These combinations may provide our competitors and potential competitors with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to more rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs. Many of our customers and potential customers are relatively large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Our larger competitors have more extensive infrastructures, which could place us at a disadvantage when competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop enhancements to, or future generations of, competitive products that will offer superior price, performance and/or cost of ownership features, or that new processes or technologies will not emerge that render our products less competitive or obsolete. As a result of the substantial investment required to evaluate and select capital equipment and integrate it into a production line, we believe that once a manufacturer has selected certain capital equipment from a particular vendor, there is a tendency for the manufacturer to rely upon that vendor to provide equipment for the specific production line application and may seek to rely upon that vendor to meet other capital equipment requirements. Accordingly, we may be at a competitive disadvantage for a protracted period of time with respect to a particular customer if that customer utilizes a competitors manufacturing equipment. Our Raider platform accounts for a substantial portion of current and anticipated sales. We have leveraged our Raider platform to address both surface preparation and ECD applications. In fiscal year 2006, the Raider platform accounted for approximately 70% of our tool revenues. We expect that revenue from our Raider platform will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. Accordingly, if the Raider platform was adversely affected by its own performance, price or total cost of ownership, or the availability, functionality and price of competing products and technologies, that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 14 Rapid technological change could make our products and inventories obsolete or unmarketable for specific applications. We operate in an industry that is subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in customer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles. For example, recent trends in semiconductor manufacturing include the move towards smaller device features to lower cost and improve performance, the use of new materials, such as copper, to achieve higher speed and performance of an integrated circuit, and the migration to 300mm diameter wafers from 200mm diameter wafers to increase productivity and reduce costs. As a result of these and other trends in our industry, we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development. Although, historically, we have had adequate funds from operations to devote to research and development, there can be no assurance that we will have funds available, and in sufficient quantities, in the future for such research and development activities. Introductions of new products by us or our competitors could adversely affect sales of our existing products and may cause these existing products and related inventories to become obsolete or unmarketable, or otherwise cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products. We may be unable to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis or in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves widespread market acceptance. Any significant delay in releasing new systems could adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share. These effects of rapid technological change could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventories or are required to write down our inventories due to changing market demands for our products. To achieve commercial success with our products, we need to manage our inventory of component parts and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer product and volume requirements. Some of our products and supplies, have in the past and may in the future, become obsolete, while in inventory, due to rapidly changing customer specifications or slowdowns in demand for existing products ahead of new product introductions by us or our competitors. If we are not successfully able to manage our inventory, including our spare parts inventory, we may need to write off unsaleable or obsolete inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we wrote down inventory by $19.1 million primarily due to a change in forecasted demand for certain of our products due to the introduction of our new Raider platform. Our dependence on key suppliers could delay shipments and increase our costs. Some components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. The loss of, or disruption in, shipments from these sole or limited source suppliers could, in the short-term, adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our future success depends on international sales. Our net sales attributable to customers outside the United States as a percentage of our total net sales were approximately 62.5%, 72.7% and 51.8% in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We expect net sales outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales. Sales to customers outside the United States are subject to various risks, including: exposure to currency fluctuations and related derivatives used to hedge such fluctuations; exposure of foreign accounts to foreign exchange translations; political and economic instability, including terrorism; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; tariffs and other market barriers; potentially adverse tax consequences; outbreaks of hostilities, particularly in Israel, Korea, Taiwan or China; difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and distributors; and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations. A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States. Such conditions could negatively impact our international sales. Although we endeavor to meet technical standards established by foreign standards setting organizations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with changes in foreign standards in the future. 15 Variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline. Variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our net sales, and thus our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period. This variation could cause our stock price to decline. Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate many of our products before committing to a purchase. We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems. The length of time it takes us to make a sale depends upon many factors, including: the efforts of our sales force and our independent sales representatives and distributors; the complexity of our customers' fabrication processes; the internal technical capabilities and sophistication of the customer; and capital spending by our customers. Because of the number of factors influencing the sales cycle, the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time when we recognize revenue from our customer, if ever, varies widely in length. Our sales cycle typically ranges from one month to two years. Occasionally our sales cycle can be even longer, particularly with our international customers and new technologies. The subsequent build cycle, or the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order, typically ranges from one to six months. During these cycles, we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue, and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts. When a customer purchases one of our systems, that customer often evaluates the performance of the system for a lengthy period before considering the purchase of more systems. The number of additional products a customer may purchase from us, if any, depends on many factors, including the customers capacity requirements. The period between a customers initial purchase and subsequent purchases, if any, often varies from two to twelve months or longer, and variations in length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and possibly our stock price. If we deliver systems with defects, our credibility may be harmed, sales and market acceptance of our systems may decrease and we may incur liabilities associated with those defects. Our systems are complex and sometimes have contained errors, defects and software bugs when introduced. If we deliver systems with errors, defects or software bugs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed. Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or software bugs, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems. Defects could also lead to commercial and/or product liability as a result of lawsuits against us or against our customers. We have agreed to product liability indemnities. Our product and commercial liability insurance policies currently provide only limited coverage per claim. In the event of a successful product liability and/or commercial claim, we could be obligated to pay damages that may not be covered by insurance or that are significantly in excess of our insurance limits. Failure of our products to gain market acceptance would adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to provide customer service and support. We believe that our growth prospects depend upon our ability to gain customer acceptance of our products and technology. Market acceptance of products depends upon numerous factors, including compatibility with existing manufacturing processes and products, perceived advantages over competing products and the level of customer service available to support such products. Moreover, manufacturers often rely on a limited number of equipment vendors to meet their manufacturing equipment needs. As a result, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected to the extent potential customers utilize a competitors manufacturing equipment. There can be no assurance that growth in sales of new products will continue or that we will be successful in obtaining broad market acceptance of our systems and technology. We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new products and refine existing products. In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of any new systems. Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market any new products is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle, including start up delays, design defects and other matters that could delay the introduction of these systems to the marketplace. As a result, if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products, we may not be able to realize sufficient sales of our systems in order to recoup research and development expenditures. The failure of any of our new products to achieve market acceptance would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 16 We manufacture substantially all of our equipment at two facilities and any prolonged disruption in the operations of either facility could have a material adverse effect on our net sales. We manufacture substantially all of our equipment in our manufacturing facilities located near Kalispell, Montana. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility. As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of either of our manufacturing facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, destruction or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason, could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines. If we cannot provide timely delivery of our systems, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected to a significant extent. If we require additional capital in the future, it may not be available, or if available, may not be on terms acceptable to us. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our cash flow from operations, and a revolving credit facility we finalized in November 2004 and amended in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, require additional financing to fund our operations in the future. Although we expect existing debt financing arrangements and cash flows generated from operating activities to be sufficient to fund operations at the current and projected levels in the future, there is no assurance that our operating plan will be achieved. We may need to take actions to reduce costs, seek alternative financing arrangements or pursue additional placement of our common stock. A significant contraction in the capital markets, particularly in the technology sector, may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital in the future, if and when it is required, especially if we are unable to maintain profitability. If adequate capital is not available to us as required, or is not available on favorable terms, our shareholders may be subject to significant dilution in their ownership if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, or we could be required to significantly reduce or restructure our business operations. The above mentioned revolving credit facility provides for up to $30 million in borrowings. There is no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs. Compliance with environmental regulations may be very costly, and the failure to comply could result in liabilities, fines and cessation of our business. We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. Current or future regulations could require us to purchase expensive equipment or to incur other substantial expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure by us to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of, hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities, result in fines being imposed on us, or result in the suspension of production or cessation of our manufacturing operations. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate, our business could be harmed. We place a strong emphasis on the technically innovative features of our products and, where available, we generally seek patent protection for those features. We currently hold 322 U.S. patents, some with pending foreign counterparts, have approximately 193 U.S. patent applications pending and intend to file additional patent applications, as we deem appropriate. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of our pending applications or that existing or future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. While we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights and non-disclosure agreements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology, or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Furthermore, certain types of intellectual property are country-specific; for example, U.S. patents provide protection in the U.S. but generally do not provide protection outside the U.S. Moreover, there can be no assurance that our existing or future patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide meaningful competitive advantages to us. In any of such events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in semiconductor-related industries. Although we are not aware of any potential infringement by our products of any patents or proprietary rights of others, further commercialization of our technology could provoke claims of infringement from third parties. In addition, we rely on trade secret protection for our technology, in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. These agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In any case, others may come to know about or determine our trade secrets through a variety of methods. 17 Now and in the future, litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could cause us to accrue substantial cost or divert our management or resources, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, adverse determinations in such litigation could result in our loss of proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities and damages to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States. In fiscal 2006, approximately 62.5% of our net sales were derived from sales in foreign countries, including certain countries in Asia such as Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, China and Korea. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell systems. For example, in many countries other than the U.S., the public disclosure of an invention prior to the filing of a patent application for the invention would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent. Similarly, in contrast to the United States where the contents of patent applications may remain confidential during the patent prosecution process in certain cases, the contents of a patent application may be published before a patent is granted, which provides competitors an advanced view of the contents of applications prior to the establishment of patent rights. For these and other reasons, we also have not filed patent applications in these countries to the same extent that we file in the U.S. There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate in these countries. Our competitors in these countries may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our systems. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in those countries. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designations of such series, without further vote or action by the shareholders. We have no present plans to issue any preferred stock in order to deter a takeover and/or adopt additional anti-takeover measures. If such actions are taken in the future, they may make a change of control difficult, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders. Any anti-takeover provisions, including any issuance of preferred stock, could have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control of us. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. We must attract and retain key personnel to help direct and support our future growth. Competition for such personnel in our industry can be high. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel. The loss of any of these key personnel, particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Raymon F. Thompson, or our President and Chief Operating Officer, Larry E. Murphy, could harm our business and operating results. We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives. Further, to support future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees. The pool of qualified applicants is limited and it can be difficult to hire and relocate personnel from other areas. Competition for such personnel can be intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified senior executives and other employees. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. 18
