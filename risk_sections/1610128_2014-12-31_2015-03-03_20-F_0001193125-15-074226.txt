Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and Our IndustryWe will need additional capital to finance our growth and refinance our existing debt, and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms, or at all, which may limit our ability to grow and compete in the commercial aircraft leasing market. We believe that funds will be available to support our growth strategy. However, future deterioration in our performance or our markets could limit our ability to access these sources of financing and/or increase our cost of capital, which may negatively impact our ability to raise additional funds and grow our business. As of December 31, (in thousands) 2012 2013 2014 Unrestricted cash $ 53,844 $ 177,924 $ 111,392 Undrawn unsecured revolving credit facilities  150,000 250,000 Available liquidity $ 53,844 $ 327,924 $ 361,392 Restricted cash $ 182,233 $ 256,426 $ 195,095 Our net cash provided by operating activities increased to $284.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $242.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is due to the growth in our Owned Portfolio over the intervening periods. This increase was offset in part by interest expense of $7.5 million incurred on the extinguishment of debt associated with the disposal of flight equipment, one-time costs incurred relating to a one-time discretionary bonus payment to our Chief Executive Officer and the costs of preparation and structuring of our IPO, which in the aggregate amounted to $11.7 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities increased to $242.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $179.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This growth in operating cash flow was primarily due to the growth of our Owned Portfolio, in addition to the full year benefit of aircraft which delivered in the preceding years. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $2,368.0 million of debt financings. This included $1,251.9 million of bank term facilities, $296.2 million of warehouse facility debt, $180.0 million of ECA and EXIM backed facilities and $639.9 million of other lines of credit. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we repaid $1,356.0 million of debt financings. This included $495.2 million of bank term facilities, $39.8 million in securitization debt, $247.0 million of warehouse facility debt, $49.4 million of ECA and EXIM backed facilities, $10.7 million of capital lease obligations and $513.9 million of other lines of credit. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $2,209.0 million of debt financings. This included $649.1 million of bank term facilities, $636.2 million in securitization debt, $523.5 million of warehouse facility debt, $186.9 million of ECA and EXIM backed facilities and $213.3 million of other lines of credit. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we repaid $1,477.2 million of debt financings. This included $599.2 million of bank term facilities, $6.6 million in securitization debt, $490.0 million of warehouse facility debt, $37.6 million of ECA and EXIM backed facilities, $137.5 million of capital lease obligations and $206.3 million of other lines of credit. See Indebtedness for additional details regarding our outstanding debt. Indebtedness Since our launch in May 2010, we have raised debt capital to support our growth from diverse sources, including both recourse and non-recourse secured commercial bank debt, export credit agency supported financing, 52 Table of Contents asset-backed securitization and unsecured revolving credit facilities. Since inception, we have sought to minimize our exposure to external market risk and liquidity risk. In accordance with this strategy, we seek to minimize our exposure to long-term interest rates through the use of fixed rate funding and interest rate derivatives, to maximize the duration of our debt and to actively manage the availability of committed financing to match our committed pipeline of acquisitions with available cash balances, cash generated from operations (including aircraft sales) and debt financings. We expect to continue the diversification of our capital base as our credit profile continues to evolve. As of December 31, 2014, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding indebtedness was 3.8% (not including the effect of upfront fees, undrawn fees, issuance cost amortization or fair value gains/losses on derivative financial instruments) and the weighted average remaining maturity was 4.6 years. Our fixed rate debt accounted for 71.0% of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date and we also used interest rate derivatives to further hedge our position. We had $1,176.2 million in undrawn debt facilities, including $250.0 million of unsecured facilities, as of December 31, 2014. As of such date, $926.2 million of the secured facilities was available for borrowing, subject to the Company acquiring (and granting the required security over) the aircraft subject to such secured facilities, and the full amount of the unsecured facilities was available for borrowing, in each case without violating any of our debt covenants. As of December 31, 2014, $4,423.4 million of our outstanding indebtedness was secured by pledged assets and/or cash collateral. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.

All of the loans contain provisions that require the payment of principal and interest on a quarterly or monthly basis throughout the terms of the loans. The interest rates on the fixed rate loans are based on rates of between 3.87% and 5.81% and, on the floating rate loans, 3 month and 6 month LIBOR plus margins ranging from 2.83% to 4.44%. Our bank term debt loans contain customary financial covenants, such as minimum cash balances, minimum tangible net worth and maximum debt to equity ratio, and, in some cases, also include loan to value covenants, and customary events of default. Full Recourse Term Facilities and Capital Lease Obligations As of December 31, 2014, 53 aircraft were financed by full recourse term facilities and capital lease obligations. All of the loans contain provisions that require the payment of principal and interest throughout the terms of the 53 Table of Contents loans. The interest rates on the fixed rate loans are between 3.61% and 5.84% and the interest rates on the floating rate loans are based on 1, 3 or 6 month LIBOR plus margins ranging from 1.8% to 3.94%. Our capital lease obligations amortize quarterly over the period of 12 years from drawdown with interest accruing at an average fixed rate of 4.07%. Securitization In October 2013, Emerald Aviation Finance (Emerald), our asset-backed securitization vehicle (incorporated in the Cayman Islands and tax resident in Ireland), issued $636.2 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate asset-backed notes (the Emerald Notes) which comprised $546.0 million aggregate principal amount of Class A-1 Notes carrying a fixed coupon rate of 4.65% and $90.2 million of Class B-1 Notes carrying a fixed coupon of 6.35%. The Class A-1 Notes rank higher than Class B-1 Notes in order of priority of payment. The proceeds of the Emerald Notes were used to refinance 20 aircraft. The Emerald Notes are secured by ownership interests in aircraft-owning subsidiaries of Emerald and the individual aircraft leases, any cash or other assets held by the security trustee and rights under the service provider agreements with us and certain other agreements and assets. The Emerald Notes amortize on a monthly basis, with a margin step-up beginning in 2020. The Emerald Notes are neither obligations of nor are they guaranteed by Avolon, and impose no loan to value covenants or other covenants on Avolon. The Emerald Notes contain customary covenants and events of default with respect to Emerald. Avolon retains the residual equity in Emerald and acts as the servicer for the aircraft owned by Emerald for which it receives servicing fees. As of December 31, 2014, a total of 20 aircraft were being financed with the proceeds from these Notes. ECA and EXIM Backed Facilities As of December 31, 2014, 17 aircraft were financed with the proceeds of ECA or EXIM backed facilities under which the subject loan is amortized quarterly over the period of 12 years from drawdown with interest accruing at fixed rates between 2.40% and 3.27% and on the floating rate loan 3 month LIBOR plus a margin of 0.43%. The loan documentation contains covenants and events of default customary for export credit agency supported financings, including financial covenants, such as minimum cash balances, minimum tangible net worth and maximum debt to equity ratio covenants. Warehouse Facility As of December 31, 2014, we had in place a $550.0 million revolving credit facility, which is a full recourse revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of aircraft. The warehouse facility has an availability period until January 2017. As of December 31, 2014, $170.9 million was outstanding under the warehouse facility and it accrued interest at LIBOR plus 2.45% on drawn balances and at 0.70% on undrawn balances. Borrowings under the warehouse facility are secured by collateral including mortgages over the aircraft assets and pledges of ownership interests in the aircraft. At December 31, 2014, four aircraft were financed by this facility. The warehouse facility includes customary financial covenants, such as minimum cash balances, minimum tangible net worth and customary events of default. Lines of Credit As of December 31, 2014, we had in place two pre-delivery payment (PDP) facilities, with maturities ranging from 2014 through 2016. The total commitment value of these facilities is $73.0 million, of which $73.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2014. These facilities are used in funding pre-delivery payments for aircraft we have ordered and are secured by security assignments of our right under the related purchase agreements to purchase the aircraft which are subject to the financing. Tranches of the PDP facilities bear interest at floating rates based on 3 month LIBOR plus margins ranging from 2.00% to 3.00%. As of December 31, 2014, our PDP facilities have been utilized to finance payments relating to eight aircraft. Our PDP facilities include customary financial covenants, such as minimum cash balances, minimum tangible net worth and customary events of 54 Table of Contents default. We also have three unsecured revolving credit facilities, with aggregate commitments of $375.0 million and availability periods until April 2017, May 2017 and June 2017, respectively. $125.0 million of these unsecured facilities was drawn at December 31, 2014. The unsecured facilities accrue interest monthly at LIBOR plus 2.00% or an alternate base rate plus 1.00% on drawn balances and 0.50% on undrawn balances. The unsecured facilities contain customary financial covenants, including minimum cash balance, minimum tangible net worth, interest coverage ratio, debt incurrence limitations and customary events of default.

Comparative Results from Operations Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2013 2014 (in thousands) Revenue Lease revenue $ 415,006 $ 537,547 Management fee revenue 2,468 3,366 Net gain on disposal of flight equipment 31,051 64,409 Interest income 1,248 696 Total revenue $ 449,773 $ 606,018 Expenses Depreciation 145,615 182,437 Interest expense 154,360 206,580 Maintenance expense  9,785 Selling, general and administrative expenses 36,748 110,147 Total expenses $ 336,723 $ 508,949 Income before income tax and interest in earnings from unconsolidated equity investees 113,050 97,069 Income tax benefit (expense) (204 ) (6,273 ) Earnings from unconsolidated equity investees, net of tax (46 ) 307 Net income $ 112,800 $ 91,103 55 Table of Contents Revenue Lease Revenue Lease revenue increased by $122.5 million, or 29.5%, to $537.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $415.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in the size of our portfolio and an increase in Annualized Lease Rates from 10.6% as of December 31, 2013 to 11.0% as of December 31, 2014. Our Owned Portfolio continued its expansion during the year ended December 31, 2014, building from 99 aircraft delivered as of December 31, 2013 to 126 aircraft as of December 31, 2014. As a result, our Aggregate Net Book Value rose from $4,260.4 million at December 31, 2013 to $5,606.6 million at December 31, 2014. Lease revenue benefited from 26 new aircraft deliveries in 2013 and 36 new aircraft deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2014, which together resulted in an increase in lease revenue of $155.2 million. This increase was offset in part by the disposal of 14 aircraft (including one constituting an insured total loss) during 2013 and nine aircraft during the year ended December 31, 2014, which together resulted in a decrease in lease revenue of $40.4 million and a $2.6 million decrease due to amendments to lease rentals, an early terminated lease and the reduced lease revenue for aircraft on floating rate leases. All of the aircraft in our fleet were on lease during the year ended December 31, 2013. In respect of one aircraft which was on lease during 2014, the Company, on a consensual basis with the lessee, early terminated the lease during the year ended December 31, 2014 and was off lease as of December 31, 2014. Our lease revenues included supplemental maintenance rent of $16.4 million (including $9.6m of supplemental maintenance rent recognized as lease revenue for one aircraft where the lease early terminated during 2014) in the year ended December 31, 2014 and $6.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. Management Fee Revenue Management fee revenue increased by $0.9 million, or 36.0%, to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the recognition of $1.3 million of a termination fee generated following an early termination of a lease on a consensual basis with the lessee during the year ended December 31, 2014, which had been on lease throughout the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, $1.0 million of origination fees was generated from the placement of five aircraft in our Managed Portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.5 million of arrangement fees generated from the placement of one aircraft in our Managed Portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was offset in part by recognition of $1.0 million of fees generated from the sale of two aircraft prior to delivery during the year ended December 31, 2013. Net Gain on Disposal of Flight Equipment Net gain on disposal of flight equipment increased by $33.3 million, or 107.1%, to $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the sale of nine aircraft. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we sold seven single-aisle aircraft and two twin-aisle aircraft compared to thirteen single-aisle and one twin-aisle aircraft sold (including one constituting an insured total loss) during the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net gain on disposal of flight equipment on a per aircraft basis was primarily due to the more favourable market conditions for selling aircraft that existed for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, two of the seven single-aisle aircraft sold in 2014 had a lower cost on a per aircraft basis compared to the thirteen single-aisle aircraft sold in 2013. See -ExpensesInterest Expense below for the interest costs incurred with respect to the extinguishment of debt associated with the disposal of flight equipment during the year ended December 31, 2014. Expenses Depreciation Depreciation expense increased by $36.8 million, or 25.3%, to $182.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $145.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in depreciation was 56 Table of Contents attributable to 26 new aircraft deliveries in 2013 and 36 new aircraft deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2014, which resulted in an increase in depreciation of $51.4 million. This increase was offset in part by the disposal of 14 aircraft (including one constituting an insured total loss) during 2013 and nine aircraft during the year ended December 31, 2014, which resulted in a decrease in depreciation of $14.6 million. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $52.2 million, or 33.8%, to $206.6 million (including $12.0 million adverse fair value adjustment on derivative financial instruments) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $154.4 million (including $8.2 million positive fair value adjustment on derivative financial instruments) for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in debt outstanding to $4,548.4 million as of December 31, 2014 from $3,536.8 million as of December 31, 2013 and $7.5 million of costs incurred with respect to the extinguishment of debt associated with the disposal of flight equipment during the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was offset in part by the reduction in the weighted average interest rate (not including the effect of upfront fees, undrawn fees, issuance cost amortization or fair value gains/losses on derivative financial instruments) from 4.4% at December 31, 2013 to 3.8% at December 31, 2014. This reduction in the weighted average interest rate was primarily driven by additional drawdowns of debt at lower interest rates in addition to repayment of debt at higher interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2014. Maintenance Expenses Maintenance expenses increased by $9.8 million, or 100%, to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $Nil million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due to maintenance expenses being incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014 in respect of one aircraft where the Company, on a consensual basis with the lessee, early terminated the lease and undertook to have maintenance work performed on the aircraft. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $73.4 million, or 200.0%, to $110.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due to both increased variable costs associated with a larger delivered fleet and an increase in headcount. In addition, we incurred a one-time share-based compensation expense at the time of the Share Exchange in respect of the founder shares subscribed for by the management investment vehicles and the Trustee in connection with the formation of Avolon Holdings. The charge was determined based on the difference between the amounts initially subscribed per share and the initial public offering price. The aggregate charge in respect of the founder shares equals $49.3 million. In 2013, options were granted to certain of our employees to acquire shares of Avolon S.à r.l. These options vested in connection with the IPO in 2014 and a share-based compensation expense of $2.1 million was incurred in 2014. In addition, a one-time discretionary bonus payment to our Chief Executive Officer and the cost involved in the preparation and structuring of our IPO, which in the aggregate amounted to $11.7 million, were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding the one-off expenses outlined above) as a percentage of total revenue remained constant at approximately 8% in the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 6.5% compared to 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effective tax rate differs from the Ireland statutory rate due to certain non-taxable income items in Luxembourg and Ireland, as well as the effect of foreign tax rates and the relative amount amounts of income earned in foreign jurisdictions. The increase to the effective tax rate in the current period was due to an increase in pretax income in Irish taxable entities while the tax benefit of non-taxable income stayed relatively constant. 57 Table of Contents Net Income Net income decreased by $21.7 million, or 19.2%, to $91.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to the adverse fair value adjustment on derivative financial instruments, interest costs incurred with respect to the extinguishment of debt associated with the disposal of flight equipment and one-time expenses incurred in relation to the preparation and structuring for the IPO and share based compensation expense. This decrease was offset in part by the acquisition and leasing of additional aircraft, an increase in the net gain on disposal of flight equipment and an increase in Annualized Lease Rates.

Our owned portfolio continued its expansion in 2013, building from 87 aircraft delivered as of December 31, 2012 to 99 aircraft as of December 31, 2013. As a result, our Aggregate Net Book Value rose from $3,576.0 million at December 31, 2012 to $4,260.4 million at December 31, 2013. Lease revenue benefited from 38 new deliveries in 2012 and 26 new deliveries in 2013, which together resulted in an increase in lease revenue of $112.6 million. This increase was offset in part by the disposal of four aircraft during 2012 and 14 aircraft (including one constituting an insured total loss) during 2013, which together resulted in a decrease in lease revenue of $7.5 million, and a $2.0 million decrease due to amendments to lease rentals and the reduced lease revenue for aircraft on floating rate leases. All of the aircraft in our fleet were on lease in the year ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2013. Our lease revenues included supplemental maintenance rent of $6.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 and $6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. 58 Table of Contents Management Fee Revenue Management fee revenue increased by $1.8 million, or 257.1%, to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of the growth in our Managed Portfolio from four aircraft at December 31, 2012 to 10 aircraft at December 31, 2013 and the recognition of $1.0 million of fees generated from the sale of two aircraft prior to delivery. Net Gain on Disposal of Flight Equipment Net gain on disposal of flight equipment increased by $19.8 million, or 175.2%, to $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as a result of our program of aircraft sales. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold 14 aircraft (including one constituting an insured total loss), which included 13 single-aisle and one twin-aisle aircraft, compared to four single-aisle aircraft sold during the year ended December 31, 2012. Net gain on disposal of flight equipment in 2013 included net insurance proceeds relating to one insured total loss. The increase in net gain on disposal of flight equipment resulted primarily from the increase in the number of aircraft sold. Expenses Depreciation Depreciation expense increased by $34.6 million, or 31.2%, to $145.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $111.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in depreciation was attributable to 38 new deliveries in 2012 and 26 new deliveries in 2013, which together resulted in an increase in depreciation of $37.7 million. This increase was offset in part by the disposal of four aircraft during 2012 and 14 aircraft during 2013 (including one constituting an insured total loss), which together resulted in a decrease in depreciation of $3.1 million. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $29.1 million, or 23.2%, to $154.4 million (including $8.2 million positive fair value adjustment on derivative financial instruments) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $125.3 million (including $3.2 million adverse fair value adjustment on derivative financial instruments) for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in debt outstanding to $3,536.8 million as of December 31, 2013 from $2,804.8 million as of December 31, 2012. This increase was offset in part by a reduction in the weighted average interest rate (not including the effect of upfront fees, undrawn fees, issuance cost amortization or fair value gains/losses on derivative financial instruments) from 4.5% at December 31, 2012 to 4.4% at December 31, 2013, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $4.4 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $6.9 million, or 23.2%, to $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The change is due to both increased variable costs associated with a larger delivered fleet and an increase in headcount. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 8% in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 9% in the year ended December 31, 2012. Taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 0.2% compared to (2.3)% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The effective tax rate differs from the Luxembourg statutory rate due to certain non-taxable income items in Luxembourg and the taxing of a significant portion of our activities in Ireland at lower tax rates. 59 Table of Contents Net Income Net income increased by $51.6 million, or 84.3%, to $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $61.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the acquisition and leasing of additional aircraft, an increase in the net gain on disposal of flight equipment and an increase in Annualized Lease Rates. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not established any unconsolidated entities for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We have, however, from time to time established subsidiaries, entered into joint ventures or created other partnership arrangements or trusts with the limited purpose of leasing aircraft or facilitating borrowing arrangements. See Note 21 Variable interest entities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 contained elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information regarding our involvement with variable interest entities. Critical Accounting Policies This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. While we believe that the estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures, and may require subjective and complex estimates and judgments. Flight Equipment Flight equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred in the acquisition of flight equipment or related leases are included in the cost of the flight equipment. We generally depreciate flight equipment on a straight-line basis over a 25 year life from the date of manufacture to a salvage value initially estimated at 15% of original equipment cost. Salvage values are determined based on estimated values at the end of the useful lives of the flight equipment assets, which are supported by historical data and experience within the industry. Changes in the assumption of useful lives or salvage values for flight equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. At the time flight equipment are retired or sold, the cost, accumulated depreciation and other related balances are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated income statement. We apply ASC 360 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and requires that all long lived assets be evaluated for impairment where circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Management evaluates recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Indicators may include, but are not limited to, a significant lease restructuring or early lease termination, decrease in appraiser values, significant air traffic decline, the introduction of newer technology flight equipment or engines, a flight equipment type is no longer in production or a significant airworthiness directive is issued. We group our assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. In relation to flight equipment, the impairment assessment is performed on each individual flight equipment. 60 Table of Contents Recoverability of a flight equipments carrying amount is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the flight equipment to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the flight equipment. The undiscounted cash flows consist of cash flows from currently contracted leases, future projected lease rates and estimated residual or scrap values for each flight equipment. We develop assumptions used in the recoverability analysis based on knowledge of active experience in the flight equipment leasing market and aviation industry, as well as information received from third party industry sources. The factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are affected by changes in future periods due to changes in contracted lease rates, economic conditions, technology and demand for a particular flight equipment type. In the event that carrying value of the flight equipment exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. This becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over its remaining useful life. We have not incurred impairment charges since our inception. As of December 31, 2014, the Aggregate Net Book Value of our flight equipment was $5,606.6 million. We estimate that the current market value of our portfolio as of such date exceeded the Aggregate Net Book Value by $568.0 million and the base value exceeded the Aggregate Net Book Value by $749.5 million. Current market value is our estimate of the most likely sales price that may be generated for an aircraft under the market circumstances that are perceived to exist at the time. Base value is our estimate of the underlying economic value of an aircraft in a stable market environment. Base value determinations are founded in the historical trend values and the projection of value trends of the underlying assets. Our estimates are based on the value opinions for our portfolio that we have received from independent aircraft appraisers, reports by industry analysts and data providers that focus on our industry and related dynamics affecting aircraft values, and news and industry reports of similar aircraft sales. Our estimates include a valuation of the redelivery condition included in our leases as assessed by an independent appraiser. These estimates assume that our flight equipment is in good and airworthy condition, without need for repair. Although we believe our estimated values are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates, estimated value determinations are inherently subjective. In addition, aircraft values can be volatile. As a result, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future market value, base value or lease encumbered value of our portfolio or of prices that we could achieve if we were to sell the portfolio. Rental of Flight Equipment We lease flight equipment principally under operating leases and report rental income ratably over the life of each lease. At lease inception we review all necessary criteria under ASC 840-10-25 to determine proper lease classification including the criteria set forth in ASC 840-10-25-14. Our lease contracts normally include default covenants, and the effect of a default by a lessee is generally to oblige the lessee to pay damages to the lessor to put the lessor in the position one would have been had the lessee performed under the lease in full. There are no additional payments required which would increase the minimum lease payments under ASC 840-10-25-1. Lease agreements for which base rent is based on floating interest rates are included in minimum lease payments based on the floating interest rate existing at the inception of the lease; any increases or decreases in lease payments that result from subsequent changes in the floating interest rate are contingent rentals and are recorded as increases or decreases in lease revenue in the period of the interest rate change. Rentals received, but unearned, under the lease agreements are recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until earned. In addition, if collection is not reasonably assured, we do not recognize rental income for amounts due under our lease contracts and recognize revenue for such lessees on a cash basis. In all contracts, the lessee is required to redeliver the flight equipment in a particular maintenance condition, with reference to major life-limited components of the flight equipment. 61 Table of Contents To the extent that such components are redelivered in a condition different to that outlined in the contract, there is normally an end-of-lease compensation adjustment for the difference at redelivery. Amounts received as part of these redelivery adjustments are recorded as lease rental income at lease termination. Flight Equipment Maintenance In all of our flight equipment leases, the lessees are responsible for maintenance and repairs of our flight equipment and related expenses during the term of the lease. In many operating lease and capital lease contracts, the lessee has the obligation to make a periodic payment of supplemental maintenance rent which is calculated with reference to the utilization of airframes, engines and other major life-limited components during the lease. We record as revenue all maintenance rent receipts not expected to be repaid to lessees. We estimate the total amount of maintenance reimbursements for the entire lease and only record revenue after we have received enough maintenance rent under a particular lease to cover the estimated total amount of revenue reimbursements. In these leases, upon lessee presentation of invoices evidencing the completion of qualifying maintenance on the flight equipment, we make a payment to the lessee to compensate for the cost of the maintenance, up to the maximum of the supplemental maintenance rental payments made with respect to the lease contract. In most lease contracts not requiring the payment of supplemental maintenance rent, the lessee is required to redeliver the flight equipment in a similar maintenance condition (normal wear and tear excepted) as when accepted under the lease, with reference to major life-limited components of the flight equipment. To the extent that such components are redelivered in a different condition than at acceptance, there is an end-of-lease compensation adjustment for the difference at redelivery. We recognize receipts of end-of-lease compensation adjustments as lease revenue when received and payments of end-of-lease adjustments as leasing expenses when we are obligated to make an end-of-lease payment and can reasonably estimate the amount of such payment. In addition, we may be obligated to make additional payments to the lessee for maintenance related expenses (lessor maintenance contributions or top-ups) primarily related to usage of major life-limited components occurring prior to entering into the lease. We capitalize lessor contributions as lease incentives, amounts paid by it to lessees or other parties in connection with the lease transactions. These amounts include the actual maintenance reimbursement we pay in excess of overhaul rentals. We amortize the lease incentives as a reduction of lease revenue. For all lease contracts, any amounts of accrued maintenance liability existing at the end of a lease are released and recognized as lease revenue at lease termination. When flight equipment is sold, the portion of the accrued maintenance liability which is not specifically assigned to the buyer is released from the balance sheet and recognized as part of the net gain on disposal of flight equipment. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. 62 Table of Contents We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. The assumptions made in forecasting future income require significant judgment, and if forecasts change or the level of future income differs from the forecasts, this may significantly impact the income tax expense in future periods. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. We determine fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. Assets Held for Sale Flight equipment are classified as held for sale when we commit to and commence a plan of sale that is reasonably expected to be completed within one year. Flight equipment held for sale are stated at the lesser of carrying value or fair value less estimated cost to sell. Flight equipment held for sale are not depreciated. Subsequent changes to the assets fair value, either increases or decreases, are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the flight equipment. However, any such adjustment will not exceed the original carrying value of the flight equipment held for sale. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards using the fair value method. For time-based share awards, the Company recognizes compensation cost ratably using the straight-line attribution method over the expected vesting period or to the retirement eligibility date, if less than the vesting period, when vesting is not contingent upon any future performance. For performance-based share awards, the Company generally recognizes compensation cost ratably using the straight-line attribution method over the expected vesting period based on the probability of the performance condition being achieved. If all or a portion of the performance condition is not expected to be met, the appropriate amount of previously recognized compensation expense will be reversed and future compensation expense adjusted accordingly. For market-based share awards, the Company recognizes compensation cost ratably using the straight-line attribution method over the expected vesting period. If the target market conditions are not expected to be met, compensation expense will still be recognized. In addition, the Company estimates the amount of expected forfeitures based on historical forfeiture experience when calculating compensation cost. If the actual forfeitures that occur are significantly different from the estimate, then estimates are revised accordingly. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is not permitted. The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The new standard will be effective January 1, 2017 and the Company is currently evaluating the effects of adoption on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 63 Table of Contents Item 6.

Board Composition Our memorandum and articles of association provide that each director is elected to hold office for a one-year term, expiring at the next-following annual general meeting or their earlier resignation, removal or vacation of office. Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Our Board is comprised of 11 members consisting of two members appointed by each of Cinven, CVC and Oak Hill Capital Funds pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement; two members of management, Messrs. Slattery and Higgins; and Ms. Cannella and Messrs. Biglari and Perlin, who are independent directors within the meaning of NYSE rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, for the purpose of audit committee membership. In addition, our Board has determined that Mr. Perlin qualifies as an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of the applicable rules of the SEC and the NYSE. See Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsShareholders Agreement for additional information regarding board nomination and observer rights. Our memorandum and articles of association provide that, unless otherwise determined by special resolution of our shareholders or by the Board, our Board consists of a number of directors not less than one and not more than 15. Subject to any other special rights applicable to the shareholders, including pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, any vacancies on our Board may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present and voting at the meeting of our Board or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. 66 Table of Contents Director Independence In general, under NYSE rules, foreign private issuers, as defined under the Exchange Act, are permitted to follow home country corporate governance practices instead of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. A foreign private issuer that follows home country corporate governance practices must disclose each requirement that it does not follow and must describe the home country practices it follows in lieu of such requirements. We rely on this exemption by following Cayman Islands corporate governance practices, which do not require director independence. Accordingly, we do not have a majority of independent directors on our Board nor do we have a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors as defined under the rules of the NYSE. Further, compensation for our executives and selection of our director nominees is not determined by a majority of independent directors or by a remuneration committee that is composed entirely of independent directors as defined under the rules of the NYSE. However, we comply with the audit committee requirements of the SEC and the NYSE, which require that our audit committee have at least one independent member upon the listing of our common shares on the NYSE, a majority of independent members within 90 days of listing and all independent members within one year of listing. If at any time we cease to be a foreign private issuer under the rules of the NYSE, and no other exemptions apply, or if we otherwise so elect, our Board will take all action necessary to comply with NYSE corporate governance rules, including appointing a majority of independent directors to the Board and establishing certain committees composed entirely of independent directors, subject to a permitted phase-in period. Because we follow our home country corporate governance practice, our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the benefits of independent directors. Board Leadership Structure Denis Nayden serves as Chairman of our Board. We support separating the position of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman to allow our Chief Executive Officer to focus on our day-to-day business, while allowing the Chairman to lead our Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to, and oversight of, management. Our Board recognizes the time, effort and energy that the Chief Executive Officer is required to devote to his position in the current business environment, as well as the commitment required to serve as our Chairman, particularly as our Boards oversight responsibilities continue to grow. Our Board also believes that this structure ensures a greater role for the non-management directors in the oversight of the Company and active participation of the independent directors in setting agendas and establishing priorities and procedures for the work of our Board. While our memorandum and articles of association do not require that our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions be separate, our Board believes that having separate positions and having a non-employee director serve as Chairman is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance. Family Relationships There is no family relationship between any director and any executive officer. Committees of our Board Our Board has established an audit committee, a remuneration committee, a nominating and corporate governance committee and a risk management committee. In addition, the Board has established three executive risk committees that will report to the Boards risk management committee. See 
