Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. As such, you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. In addition, although for ease of reading we have categorized our risk factors as relating to pending governmental investigations and litigation, business, being a regulated entity, and our common stock, it is important to recognize that as a regulated entity, many of these risks are necessarily related to each other and should not be viewed as separate and distinct. 22 Table of Contents Risks Related to Pending Governmental Investigations and Litigation Any resolution of the ongoing investigations being conducted by certain federal and state agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In 2009 we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the “DPA”) with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida (the “USAO”) and the Florida Attorney General’s Office. The DPA resolved previously disclosed investigations by those offices. In 2009 we also consented to the entry of a final judgment against us in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the “Consent and Final Judgment”) to resolve the previously disclosed informal investigation conducted by the SEC. However, we remain under investigation by the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Civil Division”) and the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “OIG”). For more information regarding the DPA and the Consent and Final Judgment, please see “Part I – Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.” We remain engaged in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the Civil Division and the OIG. Any resolution of the ongoing investigations being conducted by these agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. As previously disclosed, we have paid the USAO a total of $80.0 million pursuant to the terms of the DPA. Pursuant to the Consent and Final Judgment, we agreed to pay a penalty of $10.0 million to the SEC. Based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date, management estimates that we have a liability of approximately $60.0 million plus interest associated with the matters remaining under investigation. We anticipate these amounts will be payable in installments over a period of four to five years. In accordance with fair value accounting guidance, we discounted the liability and recorded it at its current fair value of approximately $55.9 million. This amount remains accrued in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 within the short and long term portions of Amounts accrued related to investigation resolution line items. The final timing, terms and conditions of a resolution of these matters may differ from those currently anticipated, which may result in an adjustment to our recorded amounts. These adjustments may be material. We cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts, if any, nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing, terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the Civil Division or the OIG. In addition, we have responded to subpoenas issued by the State of Connecticut Attorney General’s Office involving transactions between us and our affiliates and their potential impact on the costs of Connecticut’s Medicaid program. We do not know whether, or the extent to which, any pending investigations will result in the imposition of operating restrictions on our business. If we were to plead guilty to or be convicted of a health care related charge, potential adverse consequences could include revocation of our licenses, termination of one or more of our contracts and/or exclusion from further participation in Medicare or Medicaid programs. In addition, we could be required to operate under a corporate integrity agreement, which could require us to operate under significant restrictions, place substantial burdens on our management, hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified associates and cause us to incur significant costs. Further, the majority of our contracts pursuant to which we provide Medicare and Medicaid services contain provisions that grant the regulator broad authority to terminate at will contracts with any entity affiliated with a convicted entity or for other reasons. Any such outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The pendency of these investigations as well as the litigation described below could also impair our ability to raise additional capital, which may be needed to pay any resulting interest, civil or criminal fines, penalties or other assessments. The DPA requires us to retain an independent monitor at our expense for a period of 18 months which could divert management’s time from the operation of our business and which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We have retained an independent monitor (the “Monitor”), at our expense, for a period of 18 months from his retention in August 2009. The Monitor was selected by the USAO after consultation with us. Operating under the oversight of the Monitor may result in substantial burdens on our management, as well as hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified associates. We currently cannot estimate the costs that we are likely to incur in connection with the retention of the Monitor, including costs related to implementing any remedial measures recommended by the Monitor. In addition, the Monitor may recommend significant changes to our policies and procedures, the consequences of which we are unable to predict. Our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any such costs, remedial measures and/or changes to our policies and procedures. 23 Table of Contents If we commit a material breach of the DPA, we will likely be convicted of one or more criminal offenses, including health care fraud, which would cause us to be excluded from certain programs and would result in the revocation or termination of contracts and/or licenses potentially having a material adverse affect on our results of operations. Pursuant to the DPA, the USAO filed a one-count criminal information (the “Information”) in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the “Court”), charging us with conspiracy to commit health care fraud against the Florida Medicaid Program in connection with reporting of expenditures under certain community behavioral health contracts, and against the Florida Healthy Kids programs, under certain contracts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1349. The USAO recommended to the Court that the prosecution of us be deferred during the duration of the DPA. In the event of a knowing and willful material breach of a provision of the DPA, the USAO has broad discretion to prosecute us through the filed Information or otherwise. We could also be prosecuted by the Florida Attorney General’s office under such circumstances. In light of the provisions of the DPA, any such proceeding would likely result in one or more criminal convictions, including for health care fraud, which, in turn, would cause us to be excluded from certain programs and could result in the revocation or termination of contracts and/or licenses potentially having a material adverse affect on our results of operations. We and certain of our past officers and directors are defendants in litigation relating to our participation in federal health care programs, accounting practices and other related matters, and the outcome of these lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Putative class action complaints were filed against us, as well as certain of our past and present officers and directors on October 26, 2007 and on November 2, 2007, alleging, among other things, numerous violations of securities laws. Subsequent developments in these cases are described below in “Part I – Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.” In addition, five putative shareholder derivative actions were filed between October 29, 2007 and November 15, 2007. All five actions contend, among other things, that the defendants allegedly allowed or caused us to misrepresent our reported financial results, in amounts unspecified in the pleadings, and seek damages and equitable relief for, among other things, the defendants’ supposed breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. In April 2009, the Board formed a Special Litigation Committee, comprised of a newly-appointed independent director, to investigate the facts and circumstances underlying the claims asserted in the federal and state derivative cases and to take such action with respect to such claims as the Special Litigation Committee determines to be in our best interests. In November 2009, the Special Litigation Committee filed a report with the Court finding, among other things, that we should pursue an action against three of our former officers. Additional information with respect to these cases is described below in “Part I – Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.” In addition, in a letter dated October 15, 2008, the Civil Division informed counsel to a special committee formed by the Board (the “Special Committee”) that as part of the pending civil inquiry, the Civil Division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3729-3733. The seal in those cases has been partially lifted for the purpose of authorizing the Civil Division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints. The complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by 31 U.S.C. section 3730(b)(3). We are discussing with the Civil Division the allegations by the qui tam relators. We also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on October 25, 2007 in state court for Leon County, Florida against several defendants, including us and one of our subsidiaries. Because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing, we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and, therefore, we do not know whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations. It is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal. Thus, it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the False Claims Act, or similar state statutes, based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this 2009 Form 10-K. At this time, we cannot predict the probable outcome of these claims. These and other potential actions that may be filed against us, whether with or without merit, may divert the attention of management from our business, harm our reputation and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For a discussion of the aforementioned proceedings, see “Part I – Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.” Our indemnification obligations and the limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Under Delaware law, our charter and bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party, we have an obligation to indemnify, or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify, certain of our current and former directors, officers and associates with respect to current and future investigations and litigation, including the matters discussed in “Part I — Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.” In connection with some of these pending matters, we are required to, or we have otherwise agreed to, advance, and have advanced, significant legal fees and related expenses to several of our current and former directors, officers and associates and expect to continue to do so while these matters are pending. Certain of these obligations may not be “covered matters” under our directors and officers’ liability insurance, or there may be insufficient coverage available. Further, in the event the directors, officers and associates are ultimately determined to not be entitled to indemnification, we may not be able to recover the amounts we previously advanced to them. 24 Table of Contents In addition, we have incurred significant expenses in connection with the pending investigations and litigation. We maintain directors and officers liability insurance in the amounts of $45.0 million for indemnifiable claims and $10.0 million for non-indemnifiable securities claims. We have met the retention limits under these policies. We also maintain insurance in the amount of $175.0 million which provides coverage for our independent directors and officers hired after January 24, 2008 for certain potential matters to the extent they occur after October 2007. We cannot provide any assurances that pending claims, or claims yet to arise, will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies, that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims. Due to these insurance coverage limitations, we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification and other obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Continuing negative publicity regarding the investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As a result of the ongoing federal and state investigations, shareholder and derivative litigation, restatement during 2009 of our previously issued financial statements and related matters, we have been the subject of negative publicity. This negative publicity may harm our relationships with current and future investors, government regulators, associates, members, vendors and providers. For example, it is possible that the negative publicity and its effect on our work environment could cause our associates to terminate their employment or, if they remain employed by us, result in reduced morale that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and, therefore, associates and prospective associates may also consider our stability and the value of any equity incentives when making decisions regarding employment opportunities. Additionally, negative publicity may adversely affect our reputation, which could harm our ability to obtain new membership, build or maintain our network of providers, or business in the future. For example, when making award determinations, states frequently consider the plan’s historical regulatory compliance and reputation. As a result, continuing negative publicity regarding the investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The investigations and related matters have diverted, and could divert in the future, management’s attention, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition to the challenges of the various government investigations and extensive litigation we face, our management team has spent considerable time and effort with regard to internal and external investigations involving our historical accounting practices and internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. It is possible that our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, in particular, as well as senior members of our finance and legal departments, will spend considerable time and effort with regard to the investigations and related matters. The significant time and effort spent by our management team on these matters has diverted, and could divert in the future, its attention, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Risks Related to Our Business If our government contracts are not renewed or are renewed on substantially different terms, are terminated or become subject to an enrollment or marketing freeze, are canceled by the state due to, among other reasons, inadequate program funding contained within such state’s budget, or are subjected to decreases or limited increases in premiums, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. We provide our Medicaid, Medicare, S-CHIP and other services through a limited number of contracts with state, federal or local government agencies. These contracts generally have terms of one to five years and are subject to non-renewal by the applicable government agency. All of our government contracts are terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations. Our federal and state government contracts are generally subject to cancellation, non-renewal or a potential freeze on marketing or enrollment in the event of the unavailability of adequate program funding, compliance violations and for other reasons. In some jurisdictions, a cancellation or enrollment freeze may be immediate, while in other jurisdictions a notice period is required. For example, during 2009, CMS imposed an immediate, nine-month marketing sanction against us that prohibited us from the marketing of, and enrollment of members into, all lines of our Medicare business. This sanction reduced our revenue as we were unable to enroll new members during this period and the sanction has prevented us from receiving auto-assigned membership in January 2010, which is generally the month with the most auto-assigned members as it is the start of the Medicare plan year. In addition, we incurred additional administrative costs to correct and remediate areas in which CMS determined we were deficient. 25 Table of Contents The risk of program cancellation or decreases in premium is heightened during economic environments such as we are now experiencing as state governments generally are experiencing tight budgetary conditions within their Medicaid programs. Budget problems in the states in which we operate could result in premium rates that are inadequate to fund the required benefits. States may also postpone payment until additional funding sources are available, which to the extent we have paid amounts to providers, would materially and adversely impact our liquidity. In some jurisdictions cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required. In the event a state imposes additional contract terms on us or otherwise makes changes to the contract that impact the economic feasibility of the contract, we may decide to terminate the contract. For example, in January 2009, we determined that it was economically infeasible for us to continue participating in the Florida Medicaid reform program after Florida notified us that it was reducing our reimbursement rates. Consequently, we withdrew from the Florida Medicaid reform program effective July 1, 2009, which resulted in a loss of approximately 80,000 members. However, we may not be able to terminate our state contracts without a lengthy notice period. Some of the states in which we operate have extended the period in which we are obligated to serve our members after we notify the state that we intend to exit. For example, Ohio has recently extended the required exit period in our contract from 120 days to 240 days. If any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us, pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends, or amend the contract to our detriment, it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, cash available for operations and compliance with capital reserve requirements. Some of our contracts are also subject to termination or are only eligible for renewal through annual competitive bidding processes. For example, renewal of our PDP business is subject to an annual bidding process. For 2010, we bid above the CMS benchmark in 15 of the 34 CMS regions and are ineligible to receive auto-assigned members in these regions in 2010. As a comparison, we bid above the CMS benchmark in 22 of the regions in 2009. If we are unable to renew, re-bid or compete successfully for any of our existing or potential government contracts, or if any of our contracts are terminated, or if any limitations or restrictions are imposed, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our encounter data may be inaccurate or incomplete, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain programs. To the extent that our encounter data is inaccurate or incomplete, we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect or correct this data and have been and could be exposed to operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties potentially including regulatory risk for noncompliance. The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards, which are partly used by states to set premium rates. In some instances, our government clients have established retroactive requirements for the encounter data we must submit. On other occasions, there may be a period of time in which we are unable to meet existing requirements. In either case, it may be prohibitively expensive or impossible for us to collect or reconstruct this historical data. For example, the Georgia Department of Community Health (“DCH”) requires all plans to satisfy specific requirements regarding the quality and volume of encounter data, including a requirement that all plans submit at least 98% of their encounters based on value of claims paid. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the imposition of fines, penalties or other operating restrictions until such time as all requirements have been met. DCH has engaged a third party to conduct an audit and reconciliation of our encounter submissions to determine our current and on-going level of compliance with contractual encounter submission requirements. During 2009, DCH fined our Georgia plan an aggregate of $0.7 million due to our continued failure to submit encounter data as required. It is likely that our compliance will take additional time during which regulators may impose additional fines or penalties or take other action against us as a result of our lack of encounter data submission compliance. As states increase their reliance on encounter data, challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data could affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and our ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain programs. Negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The managed care industry historically has been subject to negative publicity. This publicity may result in increased legislation, regulation and review of industry practices and, in some cases, litigation. For example, the Obama Administration and certain members of Congress have been questioning the profits of health insurance plans and the percentage of premiums paid that are going directly to health care benefits. These inquiries have resulted in news reports that are generally negative to the health insurance industry. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and services, require us to change our products and services and increase regulatory or legal burdens under which we operate, further increasing the costs of doing business and materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 26 Table of Contents CMS will subject us to targeted monitoring and heightened surveillance and oversight of all of our operational areas during the upcoming open enrollment periods, which could subject us to new sanctions or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us. In connection with its removal of the marketing and enrollment sanction, CMS informed us that it would subject us to targeted monitoring and heightened surveillance and oversight of all of our operational areas during the 2010 open enrollment periods (i.e., the Annual Open Election Period (AEP) and the Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period (OEP)). In addition, CMS stated that it will be frequently asking us for specific data to provide CMS with assurance that the deficiencies that were the basis for the sanction are not likely to recur. Such surveillance, oversight and requests may impose additional administrative burdens on us to provide the information necessary to allow CMS to evaluate our ongoing compliance, which could ultimately increase our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses. If any of the underlying deficiencies that formed the basis for the CMS sanction recur, including if we fail to be responsive to CMS or to comply with CMS timeliness requirements for responding to beneficiary complaints or CMS identifies new deficiencies, we will be subject to the remedies available to CMS under law, including the imposition of additional sanctions or penalties, contract nonrenewal or termination, as described in 42 C.F.R. Parts 422 and 423, Subparts K and O, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, as a result of the CMS sanction and its targeted monitoring and heightened surveillance of us, the recurrence of deficiencies that in prior periods resulted in fines or penalties to us that were not significant could result in increased fines and penalties and any such increases could be material. Because our Medicaid premiums, which generate a significant portion of our total revenues, are fixed by contract, we are unable to increase our premiums during the contract term despite our corresponding medical benefits expense exceeding our estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Most of our Medicaid revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member.. These payments are fixed by contract, and we are obligated during the contract period, which is generally one to five years, to provide or arrange for the provision of health care services as established by state and federal governments. We have less control over costs related to the provision of health care services than we do over our selling, general and administrative expense. Historically, our medical benefits expense as a percentage of premium revenue has fluctuated within a relatively narrow band. For example, our medical benefits expense was 79.4%, 85.3% and 85.4% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Further, our regulators set premiums using actuarial methods based on historical data. Actual experience, however, could differ from those assumed in the premium-setting process, which could result in premiums being insufficient to cover our medical benefits expense. If our medical benefits expense exceeds our estimates or our regulators’ actuarial pricing assumptions, we will nonetheless be unable to adjust the premiums we receive under our current contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on ur results of operations. Relatively small changes in our medical benefits ratio (“MBR”), can create significant changes in our financial results. Accordingly, the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported, or IBNR, claims, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Historically, our medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue have fluctuated. Factors that may cause medical expenses to exceed our estimates include: • an increase in the cost of healthcare services and supplies, including prescription drugs, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise; • higher than expected utilization of healthcare services, particularly in-patient hospital services, or unexpected utilization patterns; • periodic renegotiation of hospital, physician, and other provider contracts; • changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them; • new mandated benefits or other changes in healthcare laws, regulations, and practices; 27 Table of Contents • new treatments and technologies; and • contractual disputes with providers, hospitals, or other service providers. We attempt to control these costs through a variety of techniques, including capitation and other risk-sharing payment methods, collaborative relationships with PCPs and other providers, case and disease management and quality assurance programs, and preventive and wellness visits for members. Despite our efforts and programs to manage our medical expenses, we may not be able to continue to manage these expenses effectively in the future. If our medical expenses increase, our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable. Changes in our member mix may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations. Our revenues, costs and margins vary based on changes to our membership mix, product mix and the demographics of our membership. Our revenues are generally comprised of fixed payments that are determined by the type of member in our plans. The payments are generally set based on an estimation of the medical costs required to serve members with various demographic and health risk profiles. As such, there are sometimes wide variations in the established rates per member in both our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business. For instance, the rates we receive for an SSI member are generally significantly higher than for a non-SSI member who is otherwise similarly situated. As the composition of our membership base changes as the result of programmatic, competitive, regulatory, benefit design, economic or other changes, there is a corresponding change to our premium revenue, costs and margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations. Reduction, delay or the inability of federal or state funding for health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, cash flows and results of operations. The federal government and many states from time to time consider reducing the level of funding for government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. For example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the “DRA”), signed into law on February 8, 2006, includes reductions in federal Medicaid spending by approximately $4.8 billion and reductions to Medicare spending by approximately $6.4 billion over a period of five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The DRA reduces spending by cutting Medicaid payments for prescription drugs and gives states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits. This law may also lead to lower Medicaid reimbursements in some states. States also periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for Medicaid and other programs. In recent years, the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict Medicaid and other health care programs costs and eligibility. Changes to Medicaid and other health care programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care costs under those programs, all of which could have a negative impact on our business. We believe that reductions in Medicaid and other health care program payments could substantially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds; such cancellations could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations. Stimulus funds for Medicaid in ARRA are anticipated to end in 2010 leaving certain states with sizable projected budget gaps in their Medicaid programs. Absent additional federal assistance, these states may be under pressure to raise revenue, reduce provider payments, and reduce benefits or a combination of the above. We continue to evaluate the impact proposed alternatives could have on our business and will take action as appropriate. For example, one state that might be affected is Florida. According to the State of Florida’s Long Range Financial Outlook Fiscal Year 2010-2011 through 2012-2013 report, the state anticipates a number of budget challenges in the coming years. This report notes that, “Overall, the General Revenue Fund is solvent for Fiscal Year 2009-10, but has projected shortfalls in each of the three planning years despite the significant revenue growth projected for those years.” Florida is one of our two largest Medicaid customers. Although premiums are contractually payable to us before or during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members, we have experienced delays in premium payments from certain states of up to five months. Given the budget shortfalls in many states that we contract with, payment delays may reoccur in the future. For example, the State of Hawaii's Department of Human Services ("Hawaii DHS") recently announced that as a result of Hawaii's budget shortfall during its current fiscal year, Hawaii DHS intends to withhold payments to plans offering services under the QUEST and QUEST Expanded Access programs, including ours, for a period of approximately three to four months. While we and other affected health plans are urging Hawaii DHS to reconsider its intention to defer payment, we can offer no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that any such delay would not ultimately go beyond four months. Our monthly premium on the Hawaii Medicaid program averages approximatley $25.0 million. 28 Table of Contents The inability or failure to maintain effective and secure management information systems and applications, successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs could result in operational disruptions and other materially adverse consequences. Our business depends on effective and secure information systems, applications and operations. The information gathered, processed and stored by our management information systems assists us in, among other things, marketing and sales and membership tracking, underwriting, billing, claims processing, medical management, medical care cost and utilization trending, financial and management accounting, reporting, planning and analysis and e-commerce. These systems also support our customer service functions, provider and member administrative functions and support tracking and extensive analysis of medical expenses and outcome data. These systems remain subject to unexpected interruptions resulting from occurrences such as hardware failures or increased demand. There can be no assurance that such interruptions will not occur in the future, and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, operating and other issues can lead to data problems that affect the performance of important functions, including, but not limited to, claims payment, customer service and accurate financial reporting. There can also be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our operations and improving service levels will not be delayed or that system issues will not arise in the future. Our information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs. If we are unable to maintain or expand our systems, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, such as the inability to pay claims or to make claims payments on a timely basis, loss of members, difficulty in attracting new members, regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses. Additionally, events outside our control, including acts of nature such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or terrorism, could significantly impair our information systems and applications. To help ensure continued operations in the event that our primary data center operations are rendered inoperable, we have a disaster recovery plan to recover business functionality within stated timelines. Our disaster plan may not operate effectively during an actual disaster and our operations could be disrupted, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and client data stored in our information systems. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations. The Internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the Internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems, or those of our providers or regulators, which could disrupt our operations, or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, fines and penalties, possible liability and loss. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by cancellation of contracts and loss of members if such breaches are not prevented. We rely on a number of vendors, and failure of any one of the key vendors to perform in accordance with our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have contracted with a number of vendors to provide significant assistance in our operational support including, but not limited to, certain enrollment, billing, call center, benefit administration, claims processing functions, sales and marketing and certain aspects of utilization management. Our dependence on these vendors makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under our contracts with them. Significant failure by a vendor to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, due to business changes or legal proceedings, our ability to manage these vendors may be impacted. In addition, due to these factors, our vendors may request changes in pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations between the parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 29 Table of Contents We encounter significant competition for program participation, network providers and members, and our failure to compete successfully may limit our ability to increase or maintain membership in the markets we serve, which may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes due to business consolidations, changes in regulation that could affect competitors differently, increased regulatory scrutiny, strategic alliances and growing revenue and cost pressures. We compete principally on the basis of premiums and cost-sharing terms, provider network composition, benefits and medical services provided, effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints, and other factors. For a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate, see “Part I – Item 1 – Business — Competition.” A number of these competitive elements are partially dependent on, and can be positively affected by, financial resources available to a health plan. Many other organizations with which we compete have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Competitors with greater financial resources than us may be better positioned than us to withstand rate compression. Further, we operate in, or may attempt to acquire business in, programs or markets in which premiums are determined on the basis of a competitive bidding process. In these programs or markets, funding levels established by bidders with significantly different cost structures, target profitability margins or aggressive bidding strategies could negatively impact our ability to maintain or acquire profitable business which could hurt our results of operations. In addition, regulatory reform or other initiatives may bring additional competitors into our markets. Failure to compete successfully in the markets we serve may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations. We may not be able to retain or effectively replace our executive officers, other members of management or associates, and the loss of any one or more members of management and their managed care expertise, or large numbers of associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The loss of the leadership, knowledge and experience of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business. Replacing one or more of the members of our management team might be difficult or take an extended period of time. In addition, we may not be able to hire and retain our executive officers, other members of management or associates for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to the: • uncertainty about government health care policies and funding and the potential impact on us; • uncertainty about potential future regulatory actions similar to the CMS sanction; • uncertainty surrounding ongoing governmental and Company investigations and litigation; and • decline of our stock price in light of the importance of equity in many of our compensation packages. Accordingly, all of these factors may impair our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our providers, we may be precluded from operating in some markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to enter into cost-effective contracts with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers in appropriate numbers and at locations convenient for our members in each of the markets in which we operate. In any particular market, however, providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical benefits expense. In some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions. If such a provider or any of our other providers refused to contract with us or used their market position to negotiate contracts that might not be cost-effective or otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage, those activities could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in that market. Also, in some rural areas, it is difficult to maintain a provider network sufficient to meet regulatory requirements. In the long term, our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will affect the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in that market. If we are unsuccessful in negotiating satisfactory contracts with our network providers, it could preclude us from renewing our Medicaid or Medicare contracts in those markets, from being able to enroll new members or from entering into new markets. Also, in situations where we have a deficiency in our provider network, regulators require us to allow members to obtain care from out-of-network providers at no additional cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage expenses. 30 Table of Contents Our provider contracts with network PCP and specialists generally have terms of one to four years, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms. We may be unable to continue to renew such contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to serve our members profitably. We are also required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets. Finally, we may be unable to maintain our relationships with our network providers or enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or on favorable terms. If we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms, our results of operations and profitability could be materially adversely affected. Our inability to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property rights in our brand names for our health plans or enforce such rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to market our health plans under our brand names, including “WellCare,” “HealthEase,” “Staywell,” and “Harmony.” We hold federal trademark registrations for the “WellCare,” "HealthEase" and "Harmony" trademarks, and we are pursuing an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register "Ohana Health Plan, Inc. & Design.” We use the “Staywell” trademark only in the State of Florida, and, pursuant to an agreement in August 2008 with The Staywell Company, a health education company based in St. Paul, Minnesota, we will co-exist with their use of that term for very different kinds of services and will not pursue a federal registration of that trademark. It is possible that other businesses may have actual or purported rights in the same names or similar names to those under which we market our health plans, which could limit or prevent our ability to use these names, or our ability to prevent others from using these names. If we are unable to prevent others from using our brand names, if others prohibit us from using such names or if we incur significant costs to protect our intellectual property rights in such brand names, our business, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. Several members of our management team have been recently appointed to their positions, and a lack of familiarity with our Company or our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business. During the past year, our management team has undergone a number of changes, including the resignation of our chief executive officer, the elimination of the position of President of National Medicare and the appointment of several members of senior management, some of whom have limited prior experience with our Company or our industry. Our operations are highly dependent on the experience and skills of our management team. The lack of familiarity and experience with us or our industry by some members of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure of our state regulators to approve payments of dividends and/or distributions from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non-regulated subsidiaries may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, non-regulated cash flows, business and financial condition. In most states, we are required to seek the prior approval of state regulatory authorities to transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts or, in some states, any amount. The discretion of the state regulators, if any, in approving or disapproving a dividend or intercompany transaction is often not clearly defined. Health plans that declare ordinary dividends usually must provide notice to the regulators in advance of the intended distribution date of such dividend. Extraordinary dividends require approval by state regulators prior to declaration. If our state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and/or distributions by certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non-regulated subsidiaries, our liquidity, non-regulated cash flows, business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Claims relating to medical malpractice and other litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. Our providers involved in medical care decisions and associates involved in coverage decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims. Some states have passed or are considering legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations, or eliminates the requirement that providers carry a minimum amount of professional liability insurance. This kind of legislation has the effect of shifting the liability for medical decisions or adverse outcomes to the managed care organization. This could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or could cause us to pay additional premiums to increase our insurance coverage. Therefore, successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us, our providers or our associates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, we are party to various other litigation matters (including the matters discussed in “Part I – Item 3 – Legal Proceedings”), some of which seek monetary damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any pending litigation or potential future litigation, and we may incur substantial expense in defending these lawsuits or indemnifying third parties with respect to the results of such litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 31 Table of Contents We maintain errors and omissions policies as well as other insurance coverage. However, potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, our insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations, or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future or that insurance will continue to be available to us on a cost-effective basis. Moreover, even if claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit, we would have to defend ourselves against such claims. The defense of any such actions may be time-consuming and costly and may distract our management’s attention. As a result, we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business. Risks Related to Our Financial Condition We may be unable to raise additional unregulated cash, if needed, in the current economic environment. Although, from time to time, we have maintained a line of credit to facilitate unregulated cash flows, we currently do not have a loan facility in place. Continued turmoil in the financial markets and general adverse economic conditions make it more difficult, and perhaps prohibitively costly, for us to raise capital through the issuance of debt, publicly or privately. If we are unable to raise additional unregulated cash when needed, our unregulated cash balances will deteriorate, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business condition and results of operations. An intercompany loan arrangement currently in place could be terminated by insurance regulators, which would have a material adverse effect on our unregulated cash position and liquidity. Two of our regulated Florida subsidiaries currently have intercompany loan arrangements in place lending a total of $50.0 million to one of our non-regulated subsidiaries. The intercompany loan arrangement was for the purpose of commencing a new business that ultimately did not occur. The loan arrangements require repayment in September 2012 and we do not intend to repay the loan until that time. However, the Florida regulators could require the regulated subsidiaries to terminate the intercompany loan arrangements before the due date, necessitating the borrowing subsidiary to repay in full the amount owed to the regulated Florida subsidiaries. If the borrowing subsidiary were required to repay the intercompany loans, or other restrictions were placed on the use of the loan proceeds, our unregulated cash balance could be reduced by up to $50.0 million plus any accrued interest. Our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. As of December, 31, 2009, our long-term investments had an amortized cost of $57.0 million and an estimated fair value of $51.7 million, and were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”). These notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans, public projects and other activities, which carry investment grade credit ratings. Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually anywhere from seven to 35 days. Auctions for these auction rate securities have continued to fail and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed in the near future. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven, 14, 28 or 35 days, as the case may be, until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non-existent. We may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 30 years) to realize our investments’ recorded value. If the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. 32 Table of Contents Risks Related to Being a Regulated Entity CMS’s risk adjustment payment system makes our revenue and results of operations difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. CMS has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for Medicare health plans to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for Medicare plans to enroll and treat less healthy Medicare beneficiaries. CMS’s risk adjustment model bases its reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors including hospital inpatient diagnoses, diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings, including hospital outpatient facilities and physician visits, gender, age, and Medicare eligibility. CMS requires all managed care companies to capture, collect, and report the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS. Because 100% of Medicare Advantage premiums are now risk-based, it is more difficult to predict with certainty our future revenue and results of operations. In addition, CMS establishes premium payments to Medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions during the year on a retroactive basis. The first such adjustment updates the risk scores for the current year based on prior year’s dates of service. The second such adjustment is a final retroactive risk premium settlement for the prior year. As a result of the variability of factors, including plan risk scores, that determine such estimates, the actual amount of CMS’s retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates. Consequently, our estimate of our plans’ risk scores for any period and our accrual of premiums related thereto may result in adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The data provided to CMS to determine the risk score is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur. These audits may result in the refund of premiums to CMS previously received by us. While our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund, this refund could be significant in the future, which would reduce our premium revenue in the year that CMS requires repayment. In February 2008, CMS published preliminary results of a study designed to assess the degree of coding pattern differences between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage and the extent to which any such differences could be appropriately addressed by an adjustment to risk scores. CMS’s study of risk scores for Medicare populations from 2004 through 2006 found that Medicare Advantage member risk scores increased substantially more than the risk scores for the general Medicare fee-for-service population. CMS found that the overall risk scores of “stayers” (a CMS term referring to those persons who were enrolled either in the same Medicare Advantage plan or in Original Medicare during the study periods) in Medicare Advantage increased more than those of Original Medicare stayers. Accordingly, in the 2009 Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year 2009 for Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates and Part D Payment Policies, CMS summarized findings from its analysis of risk scores over the 2004-2006 time period and proposed to apply a coding intensity adjustment to contracts whose disease scores for stayers exceeded fee-for-service by twice the industry average. The agency proposed to apply an adjustment that was calculated based on those contracts that fell above the threshold. In response to the Advance Notice, CMS received a significant number of comments on the proposed adjustment for Medicare Advantage coding differences, most of which disagreed with the view that CMS had identified differences in coding patterns between Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare. CMS then decided not to make a coding intensity adjustment for 2009. For calendar year 2010, a negative coding intensity adjustment factor of 3.41% will apply to all managed care plans. The coding intensity adjustment factor would be applied to beneficiaries and risk scores, resulting in a decrease in our Medicare revenue. CMS has begun a program to perform audits of selected MA plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk-adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each MA member. Our Florida HMO contract has been selected by CMS for audit for the 2007 contract year and we anticipate that CMS will conduct additional audits of other contracts and contract years on an ongoing basis. The CMS audit of this data involves a review of a sample of provider medical records for the contract under audit. We are unable to estimate the financial impact of any audit that is underway or that may be conducted in the future. We are also unable to determine whether any conclusions that CMS may make, based on the audit of our plan and others, will cause us to change our revenue estimation process. At this time, we do not know whether CMS will require retroactive or subsequent payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology that may not compare the coding of our providers to the coding of Original Medicare and other MA plan providers, and how, if at all, CMS will extrapolate its findings to the entire contract. However, it is reasonably possible that a payment adjustment as a result of these audits could occur, and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, possibly in 2010 and beyond. Reductions in funding for government health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. All of the health care services we offer are through government-sponsored programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare. As a result, our profitability is dependent, in large part, on continued funding for government health care programs at or above current levels. For example, the premium rates paid by each state to health plans like ours differ depending on a combination of factors such as upper payment limits established by the state and federal governments, a member’s health status, age, gender, county or region, benefit mix and member 33 Table of Contents eligibility categories. Future Medicaid premium rate levels may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs or state and federal budgetary constraints. Some of the states in which we operate have experienced fiscal challenges leading to significant budget deficits. According to the National Association of State Budget Officers, Medicaid spending consumes a significant portion of the average state’s budget. Health care spending increases appear to be more limited than in the past, as states continue to look at Medicaid programs as opportunities for budget savings and some states may find it difficult to continue paying current rates to Medicaid health plans. Changes in Medicaid funding may lead to reductions in the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for Medicaid, reductions in the amount of reimbursement or elimination of coverage for certain benefits such as pharmacy, behavioral health or other benefits. In some cases, changes in funding could be made retroactive, in which case we may be required to return premiums already received or receive reduced future payments. In the recent past, all of the states in which we operate have implemented or considered legislation or regulations that would reduce reimbursement rates, payment levels, benefits covered or the number of persons eligible for Medicaid. Reductions in Medicaid payments could reduce our profitability if we are unable to reduce our expenses at the same rate. Further, continued economic slowdowns in our markets have negatively impacted state revenues. The number of persons eligible to receive Medicaid benefits may grow more slowly or even decline more rapidly or in tandem with declining or stagnating economic conditions. For example, the governments that oversee the Medicaid programs could choose to limit program eligibility in an effort to reduce the portion of their respective state budgets attributable to Medicaid, which would cause our membership and revenues to decrease. Therefore, declining or stagnating general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease even further, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Historically, the number of persons eligible to receive Medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment, corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions. Conversely, this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve. Therefore, improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease, thereby causing our financial position, results of operations or cash flows to suffer, which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing. In addition, the states may also develop future Medicaid capitation rates that, while actuarially sound, are insufficient to keep pace with medical trends or inflation, therefore reducing our profitability in those markets and materially adversely affecting our results of operations. We are experiencing pressure in many states and specifically on rates in Florida and Georgia, two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue. In 2009, Florida implemented Medicaid rates that made it economically unfeasible for us to continue to participate in the Medicaid reform programs. As a result, we withdrew from these programs effective July 1, 2009, which resulted in a loss of approximately 80,000 members. Current regulation in Georgia related to payment of claims, eligibility determination and provider contracting, has negatively impacted expenses for the plan in 2009 and this may continue in the future. Further, continued economic slowdowns in Florida and Georgia, as well as other states, could result in additional state actions that could adversely affect our revenues. Similar to Medicaid, reductions in payments under Medicare or the other programs under which we offer health plans could likewise reduce our profitability. The MMA permits premium levels for certain Medicare plans to be established through competitive bidding, with Congress retaining the ability to limit increases in premium levels established through bidding from year to year. The federal government also has passed legislation that phases out Medicare Advantage budget neutrality payments through 2011, which impacts premium increases over that timeframe. Congress is considering other reductions to rates or other changes to Medicare Part D which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Legislation has been enacted to postpone a planned 21% reduction in the physician fee schedule until February 28, 2010. We expect that the physician fee schedule cut implicit in the premium rates will not be enacted in 2010 and that the following are among the events that are likely to occur: member benefits will be reduced; member premiums will be increased; and margins will decline. These events are likely to have a negative affect on our 2010 operating results and membership. In January 2009, the Obama Administration took office. Although the new administration and Congress have expressed some support for measures intended to expand the number of citizens covered by health insurance and other changes within the health care system, the costs of implementing any of these proposals could be financed, in part, by reductions in the payments made under Medicare and other government programs. Similarly, although Congress approved the children’s health bill which, among things, increases federal funding to S-CHIP and President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that provides funding for, among other things, state Medicaid programs and aid to states to help defray budget cuts, because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives, the numerous steps required to implement them and the substantial amount of state flexibility for determining how Medicaid and S-CHIP funds will be used, we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact that they will have on our business. 34 Table of Contents We are subject to extensive government regulation, and any violation by us of applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate. The laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than stockholders. The government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them. These laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what services we offer, and how we interact with our members, providers and the public. Any violation by us of applicable laws and regulations could reduce our revenues and profitability, thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are subject to periodic reviews and audits under our contracts with state government agencies, and these audits could have adverse findings which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We contract with various governmental agencies to provide managed health care services. Pursuant to these contracts, we are subject to various reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could result in: • forfeiture or recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts; • imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, fines or other sanctions on us and/or our key associates; • loss of our right to participate in government-sponsored programs, including Medicaid and Medicare; • damage to our reputation in various markets; • increased difficulty in marketing our products and services; • inability to obtain approval for future service or geographic expansion; and • suspension or loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer, HMO or third party administrator or to otherwise provide a service. We are currently undergoing standard periodic audits by several departments of insurance and CMS to verify compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations. See “CMS’s risk adjustment payment system makes our revenue and results of operations difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations” for additional risks associated with a current CMS audit of one of our plans. We are subject to laws and government regulations that may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions favorable to shareholders. We are subject to state laws regarding insurers and HMOs that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies that require prior regulatory approval for any change of control of an HMO or insurance subsidiary. For purposes of these laws, in most states “control” is presumed to exist when a person, group of persons or entity acquires the power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities of another entity, subject to certain exceptions. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our Company, including through transactions, and in particular through unsolicited transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions that some or all of our shareholders find favorable. We are subject to extensive fraud and abuse laws which may give rise to lawsuits and claims against us, the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies, we are subject to various laws commonly referred to as “fraud and abuse” laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which permit agencies and enforcement authorities to institute suit against us for violations and, in some cases, to seek treble damages, penalties and assessments. Liability under such federal and state statutes and regulations may arise if we know, or it is found that we should have known, that information we provide to form the basis for a claim for government payment is false or fraudulent, and some courts have permitted False Claims Act suits to proceed if the claimant was out of compliance with program requirements. “Qui tam” actions under federal and state law can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid or other state or federal health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. Many states, including states where we currently operate, have enacted parallel legislation. 35 Table of Contents In a letter dated October 15, 2008, the Civil Division informed counsel to the Special Committee that as part of the pending civil inquiry, the Civil Division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3729-3733. The seal in those cases has been partially lifted for the purpose of authorizing the Civil Division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints. The complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by 31 U.S.C. section 3730(b)(3). We are discussing with the Civil Division the allegations by the qui tam relators. We also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on October 25, 2007 in state court for Leon County, Florida against several defendants, including us and one of our subsidiaries. Because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing, we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and, therefore, we do not know at this time whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations. It is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal. Thus, it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the False Claims Act, or similar state statutes, based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this 2009 Form 10-K. We can give no assurances that we will not be subject to civil actions and enforcement proceedings under these federal and state statutes and regulations in the future. Any such claims, proceedings or violations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If state regulatory agencies require a higher statutory capital level for our existing operations or if we become subject to additional capital requirements, we may be required to make additional capital contributions to our regulated subsidiaries, which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity. Our operations are conducted through licensed HMO and insurance subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital and maintenance of certain financial ratios, as defined by each state. One or more of these states may raise the statutory capital level from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity. For example, New York state adopted regulations that increase the capital reserve requirement by 150% over an eight-year period that will be fully implemented in 2012. The phased-in increase in reserve requirements to which our New York plan is subject has, over time, materially increased our reserve requirements in one of our subsidiaries domiciled in New York. Other states may elect to adopt risk-based capital requirements based on guidelines adopted by the NAIC. As of December 31, 2009, our HMO operations in Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri and Ohio, and our PFFS operations, were subject to such guidelines. Our subsidiaries also may be required to maintain higher levels of statutory net worth due to the adoption of risk-based capital requirements by other states in which we operate. Our subsidiaries are subject to their state regulators’ general oversight powers. Regardless of whether a state adopts the risk-based capital requirements, the state’s regulators can require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of amounts required under the applicable state laws if they determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interests of our members. For example, if premium rates are inadequate, reduced profits or losses in our regulated subsidiaries may cause regulators to increase the amount of capital required. Any additional capital contribution made to one or more of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and growth potential. In addition, increases of statutory capital requirements could cause us to withdraw from certain programs or markets where it becomes economically difficult to continue to be profitable. For example, we have decided to exit the Medicare PDP program in Wisconsin for 2010 due to that state’s capital requirements, and auto-assigned PDP membership in Wisconsin will be re-assigned to other plans. Several changes to the Medicare program resulting from the MIPPA legislation could increase competition for our existing and prospective members and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. MIPPA was enacted in 2008 and impacts a broad range of Medicare activities and all types of Medicare managed care plans. All of the changes imposed on us by MIPPA, including those discussed below, have the potential to cause us to incur additional administrative expense, lose membership and ultimately reduce our Medicare revenues, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations: Sales and Marketing: MIPPA and subsequent CMS guidance place prohibitions and limitations on certain sales and marketing activities of MA and PDPs. Among other things, MA and PDPs are not permitted to: make unsolicited outbound calls to potential members or engage in other forms of unsolicited contact; cross-sell non-Medicare products to existing members during MA or Part D sales interactions; establish appointments without documented consent from potential members; provide meals to potential enrollees at 36 Table of Contents sales events; or conduct sales events in certain provider-based settings. In response, we have focused on more formal marketing methods (e.g., advertising and other media-generated activity) during the most recent Medicare enrollment period, which has served to increase our acquisition costs and slowed our sales. Further, the new MIPPA guidelines, along with the rapid and rigorous requirements to implement them, contributed to the violations that resulted in CMS sanction that suspended our marketing and selling ability noted earlier. Special Needs Plans: A significant portion of our MA CCP membership is enrolled in our D-SNPs. Under MIPPA and subsequent CMS guidance, D-SNPs such as ours are required to contract with state Medicaid agencies to coordinate care. The scope of the D-SNP contract with the state Medicaid agency varies greatly based on what eligibility categories, cost-sharing responsibilities and payment limitations each state has included in its state plan. The contracting process under MIPPA provides an opportunity for D-SNPs and states to improve the coordination of benefits, including defining the overlap between Medicaid and Medicare benefits, eligibility verification processes, payment and coverage responsibilities, marketing and enrollment standards, appeals and grievances procedures and other important operational considerations. Collaboration between states and D-SNPs is expected to create administrative efficiencies and improve beneficiary health outcomes. However, the requirement to contract with state Medicaid agencies imposes potential risk for D-SNP providers such as us because MIPPA does not allow continued operation of a D-SNP after 2010 if a state and the D-SNP provider cannot come to agreement on terms. Currently we have contracted with 4 of the 11 states in which we currently offer D-SNPs. While we are pursuing contracts with the remaining states, we are unable to provide assurances that our efforts will be successful or will result in terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Compensation: MIPPA also establishes limits on agent and broker compensation. The CMS implementing regulations require that plans that pay commissions do so by paying for an initial year commission and residual commissions for each of the five subsequent renewal years, thereby creating a six year commission cycle with respect to members moving from Original Medicare and a five year commission cycle with respect to members moving from another Medicare Advantage plan. We are required to comply with laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information, and we have not yet determined what our total compliance costs will be; however, such costs, when determined, could be more than anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Enacted into law in February 2009, ARRA expanded and strengthened privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, which applies to us. ARRA imposes many HIPAA security and privacy requirements directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to health plans, certain providers and healthcare clearinghouses. In addition, ARRA further limits our use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”). Among other things, these limitations include prohibitions on exchanging PHI for remuneration, restrictions on marketing to individuals, and the promise of new standards for the de-identification of data. ARRA also imposed new obligations on us to provide individuals with electronic copies of their health information, to agree to certain restrictions requested by individuals and eventually to provide individuals an accounting of virtually all disclosures of their health information. Most of these provisions became effective in February 2010 and many will be further clarified by regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). The earliest compliance date for limitations on exchanging PHI for remuneration and providing expanded accounting to individuals is in 2011. Civil penalties for violations by either covered entities or business associates are increased up to an annual maximum of $1.5 million for uncorrected violations based on willful neglect. Imposition of these penalties is more likely because ARRA strengthens enforcement. For example, commencing February 2010, HHS is required to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance. Investigations of violations that indicate willful neglect, for which penalties are mandatory beginning in February 2011, are statutorily required. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. Initially monies collected will be transferred to a division of HHS for further enforcement, and within three years, a methodology will be adopted for distributing a percentage of those monies to affected individuals to fund enforcement and provide incentive for individuals to report violations. In addition, commencing September 2009, ARRA requires us to notify affected individuals, HHS, and in some cases the media when unsecured personal health information is subject to a security breach. ARRA also contains a number of provisions that provide incentives for states to initiate certain programs related to health care and health care technology, such as electronic health records. While provisions such as these do not apply to us directly, states wishing to apply for grants under ARRA, or otherwise participating in such programs, may impose new health care technology requirements on us through our contracts with state Medicaid agencies. We are unable to predict what such requirements may entail or what their effect on our business may be. 37 Table of Contents We are currently evaluating ARRA for its specific impact on us and our customers. We will continue to assess our compliance obligations as regulations under ARRA are promulgated and more information becomes available from HHS and other federal agencies. The new privacy and security requirements, however, may require substantial operational and systems changes, employee education and resources and there is no guarantee that we be able to implement them adequately or prior to their compliance date. Given HIPAA’s complexity and the anticipated new regulations, which may be subject to changing and perhaps conflicting interpretation, our ongoing ability to comply with any of the HIPAA requirement is uncertain, which may expose us to the criminal and increased civil penalties provided under ARRA and may require us to incur significant costs in order to seek to comply with its requirements. Future changes in health care law may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Health care laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. Changes in existing laws or regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations could materially reduce our profitability by, among other things: • imposing additional license, registration and/or capital requirements; • increasing our administrative and other costs; • requiring us to undergo a corporate restructuring; • increasing mandated benefits; • limiting our ability to engage in intra-company transactions with our affiliates and subsidiaries; • requiring us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers; • restricting our revenue and enrollment growth; • requiring us to restructure our relationships with providers; or • requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems. Changes in state law, regulations and rules also may materially adversely affect our profitability. Requirements relating to managed care consumer protection standards, including increased plan information disclosure, limits to premium increases, expedited appeals and grievance procedures, third party review of certain medical decisions, health plan liability, access to specialists, clean claim payment timing, physician collective bargaining rights and confidentiality of medical records either have been enacted or continue to be under discussion. New health care reform legislation may require us to change the way we operate our business, which may be costly. Further, although we strive to exercise care in structuring our operations to attempt to comply in all material respects with the laws and regulations applicable to us, government officials charged with responsibility for enforcing such laws and/or regulations have in the past asserted and may in the future assert that we or transactions in which we are involved are in violation of these laws, or courts may ultimately interpret such laws in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Therefore, it is possible that future legislation and regulation and the interpretation of laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate under the Medicaid, Medicare and S-CHIP programs and to continue to serve our members and attract new members, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. State regulatory restrictions on our marketing activities may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect in our results of operations. Although we rely on direct marketing and sales efforts in a few of our states, the majority of our new members are obtained through voluntary selection and automatic enrollment programs. All of the states in which we currently operate permit advertising and, in most cases, direct sales but impose strict requirements and limitations as to the types of marketing activities that are permitted. For example, the State of Georgia does not permit direct sales by Medicaid health plans. In Georgia, we advertise our plans, but we rely on member selection and auto-assignment of Medicaid members into our plans. Similarly, plans participating in the Florida Medicaid program are prohibited from directly selling their plans to Medicaid recipients. In circumstances where our marketing efforts are prohibited or curtailed, we may incur additional administrative expense in trying to obtain members and our ability to increase or sustain membership could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 38 Table of Contents If a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated Medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied, our membership in that state will likely decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A significant percentage of our Medicaid plan enrollment results from mandatory Medicaid enrollment in managed care plans. States may mandate Medicaid enrollment into managed care through CMS-approved plan amendments or, for certain groups, through federal waivers or demonstrations. Waivers and programs under demonstrations are generally approved for two- to five-year periods, and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies and the waiver request is approved or renewed by CMS. We have no control over this renewal process. If a state in which we operate does not mandate managed care enrollment in its state plan or does not renew an existing managed care waiver, our membership would likely decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by the government to collect premiums, and any inaccuracies in those lists cause states to recoup premium payments from us, which could materially reduce our revenues and results of operations. Premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by our government clients. A state will require us to reimburse it for premiums that we received from the state based on an eligibility list that it later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government-sponsored program, have been enrolled twice in the same program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program. For example, in July 2008, we continued to receive premiums from the State of Florida for members that had become eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Once recipients become dually eligible, their premiums are primarily remitted by CMS rather than the state. In this case, the State of Florida had not properly reduced the amount of premium it paid to us to reflect that CMS was now the primary payor. Our review of all remittance files to identify potential duplicate members, members that should be terminated or members for which we have been paid an incorrect rate may not identify all such members and could result in repayment of premiums in years subsequent to the year in which the revenue was recovered. In addition to recoupment of premiums previously paid, we also face the risk that a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment. Our results of operations would be reduced as a result of the state’s failure to pay us for related payments to providers we made and we were unable to recoup such payments from the providers. We have established a reserve in anticipation of recoupment by the states of previously paid premiums, but ultimately our reserve may not be sufficient to cover the amount, if any, of recoupments. If the amount of any recoupment exceeds our reserves, our revenues could be materially reduced and it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our failure to maintain accreditations could disqualify us from participation in certain state Medicaid programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Several of our Medicaid contracts require that our plans or subcontracted providers be accredited by independent accrediting organizations that are focused on improving the quality of health care services. Accreditation by AAAHC or comparable accreditation is a requirement for participation in the Florida Medicaid program. Further, Florida Medicaid plans can only subcontract behavioral health services to a URAC-accredited organization. Accreditation by NCQA is a requirement for participation in the Georgia Medicaid managed care program and the Hawaii Medicaid program requires that participating plans be either NCQA or URAC accredited. Our Florida health plans are accredited by the AAAHC and our Georgia health plan is accredited by NCQA. Under the terms of our Medicaid contract, we have until January 1, 2012 to obtain NCQA accreditation in Hawaii. Failure to maintain our AAAHC or URAC accreditations in Florida or NCQA accreditation in Georgia could disqualify us from participation in the Florida and Georgia Medicaid businesses, respectively. Similarly, failure to obtain NCQA accreditation in Hawaii by January 1, 2012 could disqualify us from participation in the Hawaii Medicaid program. There can be no assurance that we will maintain, or obtain, our NCQA, URAC or AAAHC accreditations, and the loss of, or failure to obtain, these accreditations could adversely our ability to participate in certain Medicaid programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 39 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Common Stock Future sales, or the availability for sale, of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding options to purchase 1,919,535 shares of our common stock, of which 1,259,897 were exercisable, at a weighted average exercise price of $38.60 per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding 883,266 restricted stock units, which will vest at various times over approximately the next four years. From time to time, we may issue additional options and restricted stock units to associates, non-employee directors, consultants and others pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and make it more difficult for a stockholder to elect directors of its choosing The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of applicable Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests, make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions that stockholders may consider unfavorable.
