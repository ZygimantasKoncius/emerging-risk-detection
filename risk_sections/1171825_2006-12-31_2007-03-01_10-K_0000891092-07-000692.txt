ITEM 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following discussion of risks, and the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business. WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT IS GENERAL OR SPECIFIC TO INDUSTRIES, PRODUCTS OR GEOGRAPHIES. A recession or downturn in the economy or affecting specific industries, geographic locations and / or products could make it difficult for us to originate new business, given the resultant reduced demand for consumer or commercial credit. In addition, a downturn in certain industries may result in a reduced demand for the products that we finance in that industry or negatively impact collection and asset recovery efforts. As a result, credit quality may also be impacted during an economic slowdown or recession as borrowers may fail to meet their debt payment obligations. Adverse economic conditions may also result in declines in collateral values. Accordingly, higher credit and collateral related losses could impact our financial position or operating results. WE COMPETE WITH A VARIETY OF FINANCING SOURCES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. Our markets are highly competitive and are characterized by competitive factors that vary based upon product and geographic region. Our competitors are varied and include captive and independent finance companies, commercial banks and thrift institutions, industrial banks, community banks, leasing companies, hedge funds, insurance companies, mortgage companies, manufacturers and vendors. Competition from both traditional competitors and new market entrants has intensified in recent years due to a strong economy, growing marketplace liquidity and increasing recognition of the attractiveness of the commercial finance markets. In addition, the rapid growth of the securitization markets is dramatically expanding access to capital, which is the principal barrier to entry into these markets. We compete primarily on the basis of pricing, terms and structure. To the extent that our competitors compete aggressively on any combination of those factors, we could lose market share. Should we match competitors terms, it is possible that we could experience margin compression and/or increased losses. INVESTMENT IN AND REVENUES FROM OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSACTING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. An economic recession or downturn, increased competition, or business disruption associated with the political or regulatory environments in the international markets in which we operate could adversely affect us. In addition, while we generally hedge our translation and transaction exposures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or the inability to hedge effectively in the future, could have a material adverse effect on the investment in international operations and the level of international revenues that we generate from international asset based financing and leasing. Reported results from our operations in foreign countries may fluctuate from period to period due to exchange rate movements in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly exchange rate movements in the Canadian dollar, which is our largest non-U.S. exposure. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 9 WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE OUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN THE EQUIPMENT WE LEASE. The realization of equipment values (residual values) at the end of the term of a lease is an important element in the leasing business. At the inception of each lease, we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the expected disposition date. Experienced internal equipment management specialists, as well as external consultants determine residual values. A decrease in the market value of leased equipment at a rate greater than the rate we projected, whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence, unusual wear and tear on, or use of, the equipment or other factors, would adversely affect the residual values of such equipment. Further, certain equipment residual values, including commercial aerospace residuals, are dependent on the manufacturers / vendors warranties, reputation and other factors. Consequently, there can be no assurance that our estimated residual values for equipment will be realized. The degree of residual realization risk varies by transaction type. Capital leases bear the least risk because contractual payments cover approximately 90% of the equipments cost at the inception of the lease. Operating leases have a higher degree of risk because a smaller percentage of the equipments value is covered by contractual cashflows at lease inception. We record periodic depreciation expense on operating lease equipment based upon estimates of the equipments useful life and the estimated future value of the equipment at the end of its useful life. Leveraged leases bear the highest level of risk as third parties have a priority claim on equipment cashflows. OUR RESERVES FOR CREDIT LOSSES MAY PROVE INADEQUATE OR WE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We maintain a consolidated reserve for credit losses on finance receivables that reflects managements judgment of losses inherent in the portfolio. We periodically review our consolidated reserve for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and non-performing assets. We cannot be certain that our consolidated reserve for credit losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, or if our reserves for credit losses are not adequate, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. In addition to customer credit risk associated with originating loans and leases, we are also exposed to other forms of credit risk including counterparties to our derivative transactions, loan sales, syndications and equipment purchases. These counterparties include other financial institutions, manufacturers and our customers. To the extent that our credit underwriting processes or credit risk judgments fail to adequately identify or assess such risks, or if the credit quality of our derivative counterparties, customers, manufacturers, or other parties with which we conduct business materially deteriorates, we may be exposed to credit risk related losses that may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. OUR LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL MAY BE LIMITED. We rely upon access to the capital markets to fund asset growth and to provide sources of liquidity. We actively manage and mitigate liquidity risk by: 1) maintaining diversified sources of funding; 2) maintaining committed alternate sources of funding; 3) maintaining a contingency funding plan to be implemented in the event of market disruption; and 4) issuing debt with maturity schedules designed to mitigate refinancing risk. Although we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to the capital markets, adverse changes in the economy, deterioration in our business performance or changes in our credit ratings could limit our access to these markets. WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. Although we generally employ a matched funding approach to managing our interest rate risk, including matching the repricing characteristics of our assets with our liabilities, significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect both our ability to originate new finance receivables and our ability to grow. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates could result in accelerated prepayments of owned and managed finance receivables. THE REGULATED ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US. Our domestic operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. Noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of any license or registration at issue, as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties. The financial services industry is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the United States. As a result, growing our international operations may be challenged by the varying requirements of these jurisdictions. Given the evolving nature of regulations in many of these jurisdictions, it may be difficult for us to meet these requirements even after we establish operations and receive regulatory approvals. Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market and on our reputation generally. 10 CIT GROUP INC 2006 OUR ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF BUSINESSES OR ASSET PORTFOLIOS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. As part of our long-term business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of other companies or asset portfolios as well as dispose of non-strategic businesses or asset portfolios. Future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of additional debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such acquisitions may involve numerous other risks, including: difficulties in integrating the operations, services, products and personnel of the acquired company; the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns; entering markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience; and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company. In addition, acquired businesses and asset portfolios may have credit-related risks arising from substantially different underwriting standards associated with those businesses or assets. In the event of future dispositions of our businesses or asset portfolios, there can be no assurance that we will receive adequate consideration for those businesses or assets at the time of their disposition or will be able to adequately replace the volume associated with the businesses or asset portfolios that we dispose of with higher-yielding businesses or asset portfolios having acceptable risk characteristics. As a result, our future disposition of businesses or asset portfolios could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. OTHER REVENUE MAY BE MORE VOLATILE THAN NET FINANCE REVENUE. We are pursuing strategies to leverage our expanded asset generation capability and diversify our revenue base to increase other revenue as a percentage of total revenue. We invested in infrastructure and personnel focused on increasing other revenue in order to generate higher levels of syndication and participation income, advisory fees, servicing fees and other types of fee income. While these revenue streams do not involve the assumption of underwriting risk, they are dependent on prospective market conditions and, therefore, can be more volatile than interest on loans and rentals on leased equipment. Reduced liquidity in the capital markets could reduce the level of revenue and gains on sales and syndications. Disruption to the capital markets, our failure to implement these initiatives successfully, or the failure of such initiatives to result in increased asset and revenue levels, could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
