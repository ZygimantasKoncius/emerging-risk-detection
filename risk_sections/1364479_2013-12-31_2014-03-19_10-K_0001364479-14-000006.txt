ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)We incurred significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition of Dollar Thrifty and expect to incur additional costs in connection with the integration of Dollar Thrifty's operations.Hertz has incurred and expects to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies. Most of these costs have been and will be comprised of transaction costs related to the Dollar Thrifty acquisition, facilities, fleet and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We also incurred transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset the previously-incurred incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.Future results of the combined company may differ materially from the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of Hertz and Dollar Thrifty presented in this annual report.The future results of Hertz, as the combined company following the Dollar Thrifty acquisition, may be materially different from those shown in the pro forma financial information presented in Note 4 to the Notes to our audited annual consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report under the caption “Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" that reflect such results on a pro forma basis after giving effect only to: (i) the acquisition of Donlen by Hertz in September 2011, (ii) the Dollar Thrifty acquisition in November 2012, (iii) the divestiture of Advantage, (iv) the divestitures of the Initial airport locations and the Secondary airport locations (as defined herein), (v) the issuance of the 2020 Notes and the 2022 Notes and (vi) the incurrance of $750.0 million in Incremental Term Loans; in each case of (i) through (vi) above, as if they had occurred on January 1, 2011 for the pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2011 and for the year ended December 31, 2012; and in each case (ii) through (vi) above, as if they had occurred on December 31, 2012 for the pro forma financial information as of December 31, 2012. The pro forma financial information presented in this Annual Report reflects the acquisition method of accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and is subject to change and interpretation. Accordingly, the pro forma financial information presented in this Annual Report has been presented for informational purposes only. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company's financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the applicable transactions been completed as of the dates indicated.
