Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company faces risks other than those listed here, including those that are unknown to the Company and others of which the Company may be aware but, at present, considers immaterial. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting the Companys operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 1. Conditions in the real estate market generally impact the demand for a substantial portion of the Companys products and services and the Companys claims experience Demand for a substantial portion of the Companys products and services generally decreases as the number of real estate transactions in which its products and services are purchased decreases. The number of real estate transactions in which the Companys products and services are purchased decreases in the following situations:  when mortgage interest rates are high or rising;  when the availability of credit, including commercial and residential mortgage funding, is limited; and  when real estate values are declining. These circumstances, particularly declining real estate values and the increase in foreclosures that often results therefrom, also tend to adversely impact the Companys title claims experience. 2. Unfavorable economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the Company Uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and a general decline in the value of real property, historically have created a difficult operating environment for the Companys businesses and other companies in its industries. In addition, the Company holds investments in entities, such as title agencies, settlement service providers and property and casualty insurance companies, and instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities, which may be negatively impacted by these conditions. The Company also owns a federal savings bank into which it deposits some of its own funds and some funds held in trust for third parties. This bank invests those funds and any 15 Table of Contents realized losses incurred will be reflected in the Companys consolidated results. The likelihood of such losses, which generally would not occur if the Company were to deposit these funds in an unaffiliated entity, increases when economic conditions are unfavorable. Depending upon the ultimate severity and duration of any economic downturn, the resulting effects on the Company could be materially adverse, including a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, challenges to the Companys ability to satisfy covenants or otherwise meet its obligations under debt facilities, difficulties in obtaining access to capital, challenges to the Companys ability to pay dividends at currently anticipated levels, deterioration in the value of its investments and increased credit risk from customers and others with obligations to the Company. 3. Unfavorable economic or other conditions could cause the Company to write off a portion of its goodwill and other intangible assets The Company performs an impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter, or sooner if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on a periodic basis. Factors that may be considered in connection with this review include, without limitation, underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, reductions in the Companys stock price and market capitalization, increased cost of capital and negative macroeconomic, industry and company-specific trends. These and other factors could lead to a conclusion that goodwill or other intangible assets are no longer fully recoverable, in which case the Company would be required to write off the portion believed to be unrecoverable. Total goodwill and other intangible assets reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 are $0.9 billion. Any substantial goodwill and other intangible asset impairments that may be required could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 4. Failures at financial institutions at which the Company deposits funds could adversely affect the Company The Company deposits substantial funds in financial institutions. These funds include amounts owned by third parties, such as escrow deposits. Should one or more of the financial institutions at which deposits are maintained fail, there is no guarantee that the Company would recover the funds deposited, whether through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage or otherwise. In the event of any such failure, the Company also could be held liable for the funds owned by third parties. 5. Changes in government regulation could prohibit or limit the Companys operations, make it more burdensome to conduct such operations or result in decreased demand for the Companys products and services Many of the Companys businesses, including its title insurance, property and casualty insurance, home warranty, banking, trust and investment businesses, are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. These and other of the Companys businesses also operate within statutory guidelines. The industry in which the Company operates and the markets into which it sells its products are also regulated and subject to statutory guidelines. Changes in the applicable regulatory environment, statutory guidelines or interpretations of existing regulations or statutes, enhanced governmental oversight or efforts by governmental agencies to cause customers to refrain from using the Companys products or services could prohibit or limit its future operations or make it more burdensome to conduct such operations or result in decreased demand for the Companys products and services. The impact of these changes would be more significant if they involve jurisdictions in which the Company generates a greater portion of its title premiums, such as the states of Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas and the province of Ontario, Canada. These changes may compel the Company to reduce its prices, may restrict its ability to implement price increases or acquire assets or businesses, may limit the manner in which the Company conducts its business or otherwise may have a negative impact on its ability to generate revenues, earnings and cash flows. 16 Table of Contents 6. Scrutiny of the Companys businesses and the industries in which it operates by governmental entities and others could adversely affect its operations and financial condition The real estate settlement services industry, an industry in which the Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue and earnings, is subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators, legislators, the media and plaintiffs attorneys. Though often directed at the industry generally, these groups may also focus their attention directly on the Companys businesses. In either case, this scrutiny may result in changes which could adversely affect the Companys operations and, therefore, its financial condition and liquidity. Governmental entities have routinely inquired into certain practices in the real estate settlement services industry to determine whether certain of the Companys businesses or its competitors have violated applicable laws, which include, among others, the insurance codes of the various jurisdictions and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and similar state, federal and foreign laws. Departments of insurance in the various states, federal regulators and applicable regulators in international jurisdictions, either separately or together, also periodically conduct targeted inquiries into the practices of title insurance companies and other settlement services providers in their respective jurisdictions. Further, from time to time plaintiffs lawyers may target the Company and other members of the Companys industry with lawsuits claiming legal violations or other wrongful conduct. These lawsuits may involve large groups of plaintiffs and claims for substantial damages. Any of these types of inquiries or proceedings may result in a finding of a violation of the law or other wrongful conduct and may result in the payment of fines or damages or the imposition of restrictions on the Companys conduct which could impact its operations and financial condition. Moreover, these laws and standards of conduct often are ambiguous and, thus, it may be difficult to ensure compliance. This ambiguity may force the Company to mitigate its risk by settling claims or by ending practices that generate revenues, earnings and cash flows. 7. Regulation of title insurance rates could adversely affect the Companys results of operations Title insurance rates are subject to extensive regulation, which varies from state to state. In many states the approval of the applicable state insurance regulator is required prior to implementing a rate change. This regulation could hinder the Companys ability to promptly adapt to changing market dynamics through price adjustments, which could adversely affect its results of operations, particularly in a rapidly declining market. 8. Reform of government-sponsored enterprises could negatively impact the Company Historically a substantial proportion of home loans originated in the United States were sold to and, generally, resold in a securitized form by, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). As a condition to the purchase of a home loan Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac generally required the purchase of title insurance for their benefit and, as applicable, the benefit of the holders of home loans they may have securitized. The federal government currently is considering various alternatives to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The role, if any, that these enterprises or other enterprises fulfilling a similar function will play in the mortgage process following the adoption of any reforms is not currently known. The timing of the adoption and, thereafter, the implementation of the reforms is similarly unknown. Due to the significance of the role of these enterprises, the mortgage process itself may substantially change as a result of these reforms and related discussions. It is possible that these entities, as reformed, or the successors to these entities may require changes to the way title insurance is priced or delivered, changes to standard policy terms or other changes which may make the title insurance business less profitable. These reforms may also alter the home loan market, such as by causing higher mortgage interest rates due to decreased governmental support of mortgage-backed securities. These consequences could be materially adverse to the Company and its financial condition. 9. The Company may find it difficult to acquire necessary data Certain data used and supplied by the Company are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Compliance with existing federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to such 17 Table of Contents data has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or liquidity to date. Nonetheless, federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States designed to protect the public from the misuse of personal information in the marketplace and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may affect the Companys operations and could result in substantial regulatory compliance expense, litigation expense and a loss of revenue. The suppliers of data to the Company face similar burdens and, consequently, the Company may find it financially burdensome to acquire necessary data. 10. Product migration may result in decreased revenue Customers of many real estate settlement services the Company provides increasingly require these services to be delivered faster, cheaper and more efficiently. Many of the traditional products it provides are labor and time intensive. As these customer pressures increase, the Company may be forced to replace traditional products with automated products that can be delivered electronically and with limited human processing. Because many of these traditional products have higher prices than corresponding automated products, the Companys revenues may decline. 11. Changes in the Companys relationships with large mortgage lenders could adversely affect the Company A relatively small number of lenders originate a majority of the mortgages in the United States and Canada. Due to the consolidated nature of the industry, the Company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from a relatively small base of lenders, and their borrowers, which enhances the negotiating power of these lenders with respect to the pricing and the terms on which they purchase the Companys products and other matters. These circumstances could adversely affect the Companys revenues and profitability. Changes in the Companys relationship with any of these lenders, the loss of all or a portion of the business the Company derives from these lenders or any refusal of these lenders to accept the Companys policies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 12. A downgrade by ratings agencies, reductions in statutory capital and surplus maintained by the Companys title insurance underwriters or a deterioration in other measures of financial strength may negatively affect the Companys results of operations and competitive position Certain of the Companys customers use measurements of the financial strength of the Companys title insurance underwriters, including, among others, ratings provided by ratings agencies and levels of statutory capital and surplus maintained by those underwriters, in determining the amount of a policy they will accept and the amount of reinsurance required. Each of the major ratings agencies currently rates the Companys title insurance operations. The Companys principal title insurance underwriters financial strength ratings are A3 by Moodys Investor Services, Inc., A- by Fitch Ratings Ltd., BBB+ by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and A- by A.M. Best Company, Inc. These ratings provide the agencies perspectives on the financial strength, operating performance and cash generating ability of those operations. These agencies continually review these ratings and the ratings are subject to change. Statutory capital and surplus, or the amount by which statutory assets exceed statutory liabilities, is also a measure of financial strength. The Companys principal title insurance underwriter maintained approximately $959.0 million of total statutory capital and surplus as of December 31, 2012. Accordingly, if the ratings or statutory capital and surplus of these title insurance underwriters are reduced from their current levels, or if there is a deterioration in other measures of financial strength, the Companys results of operations, competitive position and liquidity could be adversely affected. 13. The Companys investment portfolio is subject to certain risks and could experience losses The Company maintains a substantial investment portfolio, primarily consisting of fixed income securities (including mortgage-backed securities). The investment portfolio also includes money-market and other short-term investments, as well as some preferred and common stock. Securities in the Companys investment 18 Table of Contents portfolio are subject to certain economic and financial market risks, such as credit risk, interest rate (including call, prepayment and extension) risk and/or liquidity risk. The risk of loss associated with the portfolio is increased during periods of instability in credit markets and economic conditions. If the carrying value of the investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company will be required to write down the value of the investments, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, statutory surplus and financial condition. 14. The Companys pension plan is currently underfunded and pension expenses and funding obligations could increase significantly as a result of weak performance of financial markets and its effect on plan assets The Company is responsible for the obligations of its defined benefit pension plan, which it assumed from its former parent, The First American Corporation, on June 1, 2010 in connection with the spin-off transaction which was consummated on that date. The plan was closed to new entrants effective December 31, 2001 and amended to freeze all benefit accruals as of April 30, 2008. The Companys future funding obligations for this plan depend upon, among other factors, the future performance of assets held in trust for the plan and interest rates. The pension plan was underfunded as of December 31, 2012 by approximately $130.2 million and the Company may need to make significant contributions to the plan. In addition, pension expenses and funding requirements may also be greater than currently anticipated if the market values of the assets held by the pension plan decline or if the other assumptions regarding plan earnings, expenses and interest rates require adjustment. The Companys obligations under this plan could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 15. Actual claims experience could materially vary from the expected claims experience reflected in the Companys reserve for incurred but not reported claims The Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims pertaining to its title, escrow and other insurance and guarantee products. The majority of this reserve pertains to title insurance policies, which are long-duration contracts with the majority of the claims reported within the first few years following the issuance of the policy. Generally, 75 to 85 percent of claim amounts become known in the first six years of the policy life, and the majority of IBNR reserves relate to the six most recent policy years. A material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for policy years older than six years, while possible, is not considered reasonably likely. However, changes in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent policy years are considered likely and could result in a material adjustment to the IBNR reserves. Based on historical experience, management believes a 50 basis point change to the loss rates for the most recent policy years, positive or negative, is reasonably likely given the long duration nature of a title insurance policy. For example, if the expected ultimate losses for each of the last six policy years increased or decreased by 50 basis points, the resulting impact on the Companys IBNR reserve would be an increase or decrease, as the case may be, of $110.5 million. The estimates made by management in determining the appropriate level of IBNR reserves could ultimately prove to be materially different from actual claims experience. 16. The issuance of the Companys title insurance policies and related activities by title agents, which operate with substantial independence from the Company, could adversely affect the Company The Companys title insurance subsidiaries issue a significant portion of their policies through title agents that operate with a substantial degree of independence from the Company. While these title agents are subject to certain contractual limitations that are designed to limit the Companys risk with respect to their activities, there is no guarantee that the agents will fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. In addition, regulators are increasingly seeking to hold the Company responsible for the actions of these title agents and, under certain circumstances, the Company may be held liable directly to third parties for actions (including defalcations) or omissions of these agents. As a result, the Companys use of title agents could result in increased claims on the Companys policies issued through agents and an increase in other costs and expenses. 19 Table of Contents 17. Systems interruptions and intrusions, wire transfer errors and unauthorized data disclosures may impair the delivery of the Companys products and services, harm the Companys reputation and result in material claims for damages System interruptions and intrusions may impair the delivery of the Companys products and services, resulting in a loss of customers and a corresponding loss in revenue. The Companys businesses depend heavily upon computer systems located in its data centers. Certain events beyond the Companys control, including natural disasters, telecommunications failures and intrusions into the Companys systems by third parties could temporarily or permanently interrupt the delivery of products and services. These interruptions also may interfere with suppliers ability to provide necessary data and employees ability to attend work and perform their responsibilities. The Company also relies on its systems, employees and domestic and international banks to transfer funds. These transfers are susceptible to user input error, fraud, system interruptions or intrusions, incorrect processing and similar errors that could result in lost funds that may be significant. As part of its business, the Company maintains non-public personal information on consumers. There can be no assurance that unauthorized disclosure will not occur either through system intrusions or the actions of third parties or employees. Unauthorized disclosures could adversely affect the Companys reputation and expose it to material claims for damages. 18. The Company may not be able to realize the benefits of its offshore strategy The Company utilizes lower cost labor in foreign countries, such as India and the Philippines, among others. These countries are subject to relatively high degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand natural disasters. Such disruptions could decrease efficiency and increase the Companys costs in these countries. Weakness of the United States dollar in relation to the currencies used in these foreign countries may also reduce the savings achievable through this strategy. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries is subject to heightened scrutiny in the United States and, as a result, some of the Companys customers may require it to use labor based in the United States. Laws or regulations that require the Company to use labor based in the United States or effectively increase the cost of the Companys foreign labor also could be enacted. The Company may not be able to pass on these increased costs to its customers. 19. As a holding company, the Company depends on distributions from its subsidiaries, and if distributions from its subsidiaries are materially impaired, the Companys ability to declare and pay dividends may be adversely affected; in addition, insurance and other regulations limit the amount of dividends, loans and advances available from the Companys insurance subsidiaries The Company is a holding company whose primary assets are investments in its operating subsidiaries. The Companys ability to pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds. If the Companys operating subsidiaries are not able to pay dividends or repay funds, the Company may not be able to fulfill parent company obligations and/or declare and pay dividends to its stockholders. Moreover, pursuant to insurance and other regulations under which the Companys insurance subsidiaries operate, the amount of dividends, loans and advances available is limited. As of December 31, 2012, under such regulations, the maximum amount of dividends, loans and advances available in 2013 from these insurance subsidiaries, without prior approval from applicable regulators, was $405.4 million. 20 Table of Contents 20. Certain provisions of the Companys bylaws and certificate of incorporation may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that the Companys stockholders might consider favorable The Companys bylaws and certificate of incorporation contain provisions that could be considered anti-takeover provisions because they make it harder for a third-party to acquire the Company without the consent of the Companys incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions:  election of the Companys board of directors is staggered such that only one-third of the directors are elected by the stockholders each year and the directors serve three year terms prior to reelection;  stockholders may not remove directors without cause, change the size of the board of directors or, except as may be provided for in the terms of preferred stock the Company issues in the future, fill vacancies on the board of directors;  stockholders may act only at stockholder meetings and not by written consent;  stockholders must comply with advance notice provisions for nominating directors or presenting other proposals at stockholder meetings; and  the Companys board of directors may without stockholder approval issue preferred shares and determine their rights and terms, including voting rights, or adopt a stockholder rights plan. While the Company believes that they are appropriate, these provisions, which may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of approximately 67 percent of the Companys issued voting shares, could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by the Companys stockholders.
