ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS NiSource Inc. Growing competition in the gas transportation industry could result in the failure by customers to renew existing contracts. As a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and the shift in natural gas production areas, end users and LDCs may be reluctant to enter into long-term service contracts. The renewal or replacement of existing contracts with NiSourceÂ’s customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control, including competition from other pipelines, gatherers, the proximity of supplies to the markets, and the price of, and demand for, natural gas. The inability of NiSource to renew, or replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market conditions could materially impact its financial results. ITEM 1B.
