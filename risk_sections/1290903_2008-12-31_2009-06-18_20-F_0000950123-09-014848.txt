Risk FactorsPRC regulations may limit our ability to transfer our funds held overseas into China. Taxation The following discussion summarizes certain Cayman Islands tax and United States federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of April 30, 2009, all of which are subject to change at any time without our prior notice. Although the following discussion does not purport to describe all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a prospective purchaser of our ADSs or shares, this discussion summarizes certain Cayman Islands tax consequences to a holder of ADSs or shares that is not resident (in the case of an individual) or domiciled (in the case of a legal entity) in the Cayman Islands (in either case, referred to herein as not resident or as a non-resident) and does not have a permanent establishment or fixed base located in the Cayman Islands through which such ADSs or shares are held, and certain material United States federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder (as that term is defined below) of ADSs or shares that is not resident (in the case of an individual) or domiciled (in the case of a legal entity) in the Cayman Islands (in either case, referred to herein as not resident or as a non-resident) and does not have a permanent establishment or fixed base located in the Cayman Islands through which such ADSs or shares are held. Cayman Islands Taxation The Cayman Islands currently levy no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties that may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands are not party to any double taxation treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands. United States Federal Income Taxation The following discussion is a summary of the material United States federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to the purchase, holding, ownership, disposition or sale of our ADSs or ordinary shares. 80 Table of Contents This discussion is general in nature and does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation which may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances, including investors subject to special U.S. taxation rules, such as:  banks;  dealers in securities or currencies;  financial institutions;  insurance companies;  tax-exempt organizations;  persons holding ADSs or ordinary shares as part of hedging, conversion, constructive sale, straddle or other integrated transactions;  traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting;  persons who own 5% or more of our shares;  U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; or  Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below). This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. Furthermore, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and U.S. Treasury regulations (including temporary and proposed regulations), rulings and judicial decisions thereunder as of April 30, 2009. Such authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, which may result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. A U.S. Holder holding or considering acquiring or disposing of our ADSs or ordinary shares is urged to consult his or her own tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax consequences of the holding, ownership, purchase, disposition or sale of our ADSs or ordinary shares in light of such U.S. Holders particular circumstances. A U.S. Holder for purposes of this discussion is a beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares that is a U.S. person. A U.S. person is:  a citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation, regardless of its source; or  a trust if it is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. 81 Table of Contents A beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares that is not a U.S. Holder is referred to herein as a Non-U.S. Holder. If a partnership holds ADSs or ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner of a partnership holding ADSs or ordinary shares is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding an investment in our ADSs or ordinary shares. ADSs. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of ADSs will be treated as the owner of the underlying ordinary shares that are represented by such ADSs. Deposits and withdrawals of ordinary shares in exchange for ADSs will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation. Distributions on ADSs or ordinary shares. Subject to the application of the passive foreign investment company rules, as discussed below, the gross amount of any distributions in respect of the ADSs or ordinary shares will be subject to tax as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Subject to certain limitations, dividends paid to non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, may be eligible for a reduced rate of taxation if we are deemed to be, or will be treated as, a qualified foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and provided that such holder satisfies certain holding period requirements with respect to the ownership of our ADSs or ordinary shares. Subject to the exceptions discussed below, dividends paid by a foreign corporation will be treated as being paid by a qualified foreign corporation if the corporation is:  a corporation incorporated in a possession of the United States;  a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program; or  a foreign corporation whose stock with respect to which a dividend is paid or whose ADSs backed by such stock are readily tradable on an established securities market within the United States. A foreign corporation (even if it is a corporation described above) does not constitute a qualified foreign corporation if the foreign corporation is a passive foreign investment company. We have not previously paid any dividends to our shareholders. No assurance can be given that dividends paid by us will be treated as being paid by a qualified foreign corporation. As indicated below, we believe we are likely to be classified as a PFIC in 2008 and there can be no assurance that we will not be classified as a PFIC in 2009 and future years. Dividends paid by us will not be treated as paid by a qualified foreign corporation and, consequently, would not qualify for the reduced rate of federal income tax described above, unless we were not a PFIC in both our taxable year in which such dividends are paid and in our immediately preceding taxable year. If we were classified as a PFIC in 2008 or 2009, any dividends we pay to U.S. Holders during 2009 would not qualify for this reduced rate of tax. In addition, our status as a qualified foreign corporation may change. A U.S. Holder that exchanges its ADSs for ordinary shares may not be eligible for the reduced rate of taxation on dividends if the ordinary shares are not deemed to be readily tradable on an established securities market within the United States. Dividends will be includable in a U.S. Holders gross income on the date actually or constructively received by the depositary, in the case of ADSs or, in the case of ordinary shares, by such U.S. Holder. These dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to U.S. corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations. To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital, causing a reduction in the adjusted basis of the ADSs or ordinary shares, and the balance in excess of adjusted basis will be taxed as capital gain. 82 Table of Contents Sale, exchange or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares. Subject to the application of the passive foreign investment company rules, as discussed below, upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition and the adjusted tax basis of the U.S. Holder in the ADSs or ordinary shares. The capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of sale, exchange or other disposition, the U.S. Holder has held the ADS or ordinary share for more than one year. Net long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss that a U.S. Holder recognizes generally will be treated as gain or loss from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Passive foreign investment company rules. In general, we will be classified as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year in which either (a) at least 75% of our gross income is passive income or (b) at least 50% of the value (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) of our assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents (other than rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and not derived from a related person), annuities and gains from assets that produce passive income. If we own at least 25% by value of the equity shares of another corporation, we will be treated for purposes of the passive foreign investment company tests as owning a proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation, and as receiving directly a proportionate share of the other corporations income. The tax rules do not clearly indicate whether our contractual arrangements with our variable interest entities would be treated as ownership of equity in such entities. The annual PFIC determination to be made by a U.S. Holder of our ordinary shares (including ADSs) is an inherently factual determination and there is limited guidance regarding the application of the PFIC rules to specific situations. Depending on the valuation of our ordinary shares (including ADSs) and high-vote ordinary shares, as well as our goodwill and other assets and income, we believe we are likely to be classified as a PFIC for 2008. In addition, as the determination of PFIC status is made on an annual basis and depends on variables over which we have limited control, there can be no assurance that we will not be classified as a PFIC for 2009 or any future calendar years. If we are classified as a PFIC in any year, U.S. Holders would be subject to the tax regime described in the following paragraphs. If we are a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder has an equity interest in us, unless the U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, such U.S. Holder will be subject to special tax rules in any future taxable year, regardless of whether we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in such future years with respect to (a) excess distributions and (b) gain from the sale or other disposition of stock. Excess distributions are defined generally as the excess of the amount received with respect to the equity interests in the taxable year over 125% of the average annual distributions received in the shorter of either the three previous years or a U.S. Holders holding period before the taxable year. Under these special tax rules: l the gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the holding period for the ordinary shares or ADSs; l the amount allocated to the taxable year in which the gain or excess distribution is realized will be taxed as ordinary income; l the amount allocated to each prior year in which we were a PFIC, with certain exceptions, will be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year; and l the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such prior year. In some circumstances, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, a U.S. Holder may avoid certain of the unfavorable consequences of the PFIC rules by making a qualified electing fund (QEF) election with respect to our company. A QEF election would require the electing U.S. holder to include in curent income the U.S. holders pro rata share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of our company for the relevant tax year. However, a U.S. Holder would not be able to elect QEF status with respect to our ADSs or ordinary shares unless we furnish such U.S. Holder annually with certain additional tax information, and we currently do not intend to provide such information. In certain circumstances, instead of being subject to the excess distribution rules discussed above, a U.S. Holder may make an election to include gain on the ADSs or ordinary shares of a passive foreign investment company as ordinary income under a mark-to-market method, provided that the ADSs or ordinary shares are regularly traded on a qualified exchange. The mark-to-market election is only available for ADSs or ordinary shares that are regularly traded within the meaning of U.S. Treasury regulations on certain designated U.S. exchanges and foreign exchanges that meet trading, listing, financial disclosure and other requirements to be treated as a qualified exchange. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, the U.S. Holder will include each year as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the U.S. Holders ADSs or ordinary shares at the end of the taxable year over such U.S. Holders adjusted basis in the ADSs (or ordinary shares, if applicable) and will be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of these ADSs or ordinary shares over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but limited to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A U.S. Holders basis in the ADSs or ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts. If a U.S. Holder has held our ordinary shares or ADSs at any time when we were a PFIC, such U.S. Holder will be required to attach Internal Revenue Service Form 8621 to his or her federal income tax return for such U.S. Holders taxable year during which such U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of such ordinary shares or ADSs at a gain or otherwise receives an excess distribution with respect to such ordinary shares or ADSs or for which such U.S. Holder wishes to make a QEF election. A U.S. Holder is urged to consult his or her tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ADSs or ordinary shares under the passive foreign investment company rules. Taxation of Holders of ADSs or Shares in Other Countries Holders or potential holders of our ADSs who are resident or otherwise taxable in countries other than the United States are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ADSs. 83 Table of Contents Documents on Display We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) that are applicable to a foreign private issuer. In accordance with the Exchange Act, we file an annual report on Form 20-F with the SEC, and furnish other reports to the SEC. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of quarterly reports and proxy statements, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Copies of reports and other information, when so filed with or furnished to the SEC, may be inspected without charge and copied at prescribed rates at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of these materials are also available by mail from the Public Reference Section of the SEC, at 100 F Street., N.E., Washington D.C. 20549, at prescribed rates. You may obtain information on the operation of Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as us, that file and furnish reports electronically with the SEC. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We will make available our annual report on Form 20-F (which includes annual audited consolidated financial statements) to our shareholders by posting a link to the annual report on our website (http://www.elong.net/AboutUs/sec_filings.html).

Not applicable. PART II Item 13: Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies. Not applicable. Item 14: Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds. Use of Proceeds The following discussion relates to the initial public offering our ADSs by us and certain selling shareholders, pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-1 , which was completed on November 2, 2004. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 27, 2004. We received net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses related to the offering) of approximately US$42 million from the offering 4,602,547 ADSs, representing 9,205,094 ordinary shares. 84 Table of Contents From November 2, 2004 through April 30, 2009, we used a minor portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to fund the acquisitions of Raytime and Fortunetrip, and also to fund a minor percentage of our operations. The substantial majority of our operations are funded through our operating revenues. Item 15: Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, Guangfu Cui and our CFO, Mike Doyle, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2008. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the material financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in this annual report on Form 20-F is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner. Based on this evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young Hua Ming, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which appears below. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of eLong, Inc.: We have audited eLong, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). eLong, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 85 Table of Contents A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, eLong Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 of eLong, Inc. and our report dated June 2, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young Hua Ming Beijing, The Peoples Republic of China June 2, 2009 Limitations on Controls. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the sound control procedures. Any control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within eLong have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management, including our CEO and CFO, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, we modified some of our internal control procedures, in accordance with our implementation of a new Oracle ERP system. During the transition period between our prior system and the new ERP system, we tested and reviewed the new controls over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our management believes that our internal controls were effective as of December 31, 2008. 86 Table of Contents Item 16A: Audit Committee Financial Expert. The audit committee of our board of directors currently consists of Leo Austin, Michael Scown, and Thomas Gurnee (who serves as chairman). Our board of directors has determined that all of our audit committee members are independent under NASDAQs Listing Rules, Section 10A(m) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In addition, our board of directors has determined that Mr. Gurnee is an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of the Instructions to Form 20-F and that Mr. Austin and Mr. Scown each has the requisite financial knowledge and experience to be qualified to serve as a member of our audit committee. Item 16B: Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our board of directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics applicable to every employee of our company, including our CEO and CFO, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, consistent with the requirements of the NASDAQ Listing Rules. We did not amend our code of conduct in 2008. Our code of ethics is posted on our website at http://www.eLong.net/AboutUs/code_conduct.html. Item 16C: Principal Accountant Fees and Services. KPMG acted as the independent registered public accounting firm of our company for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007. Effective October 10, 2008, we dismissed KPMG and engaged Ernst & Young Hua Ming (Ernst &Young) to act as our independent public accounting firm. The following table sets forth the aggregate fees by category in connection with certain professional services rendered by KPMG and Ernst & Young for the periods indicated. 2007 2008 RMB RMB (in 000) (in 000) Audit Fees (KPMG)(1) 4,515 1,645 Audit Fees (Ernst & Young)(1)  4,752 Total 4,515 6,397 (1) Audit Fees are the aggregate fees billed by KPMG or Ernst & Young for the audit of our consolidated annual financial statements and procedures related to our quarterly financial statements. We were billed approximately RMB6.4million (US$0.9 million) for 2008 in Audit Fees. We have not yet been fully billed by Ernst & Young for audit fees in relation to the year ended December 31, 2008. Our audit committee is responsible for the retention of our independent registered public accounting firm. Our audit committee has adopted its own rules of procedure, in the form of an audit committee charter. The audit committees rules of procedure provide for a process with respect to the prior approval of all non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditors. Our audit committee reports to our board of directors regarding the scope and results of our annual audits, compliance with our accounting and financial policies and managements procedures and policies related to the adequacy of our internal accounting controls. 87 Table of Contents Our audit committee was formed during 2004. In 2008 our audit committee pre-approved the engagement of Ernst & Young, the dismissal of KPMG and all audit services provided by KPMG and Ernst & Young. Item 16D: Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committees. Not applicable. Item 16E: Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers. On February 27, 2008, we publicly announced the approval by our board of directors of a share buy back of up to US$20 million. From the commencement of share repurchases under the share buyback through December 5, 2008 when the program was suspended, the Company repurchased 2,000,000 ADSs (equivalent to four million ordinary shares) at a total purchase price of US$15 million (equivalent to an average price of US$7.51 per ADS or US3.76 per ordinary share). All shares repurchased buy the Company during 2008 were repurchased pursuant to our publicly announced share buyback plan. The table below provides additional details on our repurchases of ADSs by month under the share buyback program during 2008. 2008 Number of Purchase Price Average Price Paid Per Average Price Paid Per Month ADSs Purchased (US$)* ADS (US$)* Ordinary Share (US$)* March 81,800 694,113.33 8.49 4.24 April 97,761 864,544.43 8.84 4.42 May 140,632 1,300,740.26 9.25 4.62 June 223,600 1,682,507.89 7.52 3.76 July 143,039 1,048,446.49 7.33 3.66 August 157,290 1,128,873.05 7.18 3.59 September 227,100 1,619,139.10 7.13 3.56 October 428,000 3,077,547.00 7.19 3.60 November 344,000 2,487,193.90 7.23 3.62 December 156,778 1,120,689.80 7.15 3.57 Total 2,000,000 15,023,795.24 7.51 3.76 * Cost and average price data includes trading commissions. Some numbers may not add due to rounding. Item 16G: Corporate Governance. As we are a controlled company, and Expedia has sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a shareholder vote, we generally intend to rely on the home country practice exception available to foreign private issuers under the NASDAQ Listing Rules, and not present certain matters for a shareholder vote, where such shareholder vote would otherwise be required under the NASDAQ Listing Rules, including Rule 5635 which sets forth certain circumstances requiring shareholder approval. For example, our board of directors adopted the eLong, Inc. 2009 Share and Annual Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan) on May 13, 2009 without seeking prior shareholder approval, as permitted under our articles of association and applicable law of the Cayman Islands. We have notified NASDAQ of our decision to use this home country practice with respect to the adoption of equity incentive plans such as the 2009 Plan. 88 Table of Contents PART III Item 17: Financial Statements.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. F-6 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (1) ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS eLong, Inc. (the Company and through its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs), collectively the Group), is principally engaged in the provision of travel services, including hotel information and reservation services, airline reservations and ticketing, and to a lesser extent, internet-related advertising and other related services in the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC). The Company, through its subsidiaries, conducts its operations in the PRC through a series of agreements with various VIEs. These VIEs facilitate the Companys participation in Internet content provision, short messaging, call center services, travel agency and air ticketing services, which are industries in the PRC in which foreign ownership is restricted. The Company does not have any direct equity interest in the VIEs. However, pursuant to certain agreements and arrangements with the VIEs and the shareholders of the VIEs, which include exclusive technical services agreements, equity pledge agreements, operating agreements and loan agreements, the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as it absorbs the VIEs losses and receives the VIEs residual returns to the extent such returns are paid as dividends. As a result, the financial position and results of the VIEs have been consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, Expedia, Inc., through ownership of Expedia Asia Pacific-Alpha Limited, controls approximately 95% and 96%, respectively, of the Companys voting power and has the ability to control substantially all of the Companys management and business operations. (2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs. All significant transactions and balances between the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated upon consolidation. (b) Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). (c) Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management of the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include allowances for doubtful accounts, deferred income tax assets, provision for loyalty points, share-based compensation, the allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions, useful lives and residual values of property and equipment and intangible assets, and the recovery of the carrying values of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets. F-7 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (d) Foreign currencies The Groups functional and reporting currency is the Renminbi (RMB). Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are measured at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the RMB are remeasured into RMB using the applicable exchange rates quoted by the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) at the balance sheet dates. All such exchange gains and losses are included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars (US$) are solely for the convenience of the reader and are calculated at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.8225, representing the noon buying rate in the City of New York for cable transfers of RMB, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on December 31, 2008. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at that rate on December 31, 2008, or at any other rate. (e) Commitments and contingencies In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for such contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. (f) Revenue recognition The Groups revenues are principally derived from providing hotel reservations, air ticketing and other related travel services. The Group recognizes revenues when all of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of arrangement with the customer, services have been performed, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability of the fees is reasonably assured, as prescribed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB104). These criteria as related to the Groups revenues are considered to have been met as follows: Hotel reservation services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for hotel room reservations booked through the Group. Commissions from hotel reservation services rendered are recognized after hotel customers have completed their stay at the applicable hotel. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent (EITF 99-19), as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risk, and has no obligations to the hotel for cancelled hotel reservations. Contracts with certain travel suppliers contain escalating commissions that are subject to achieving specific performance targets. Such escalating commissions are recognized when the performance targets have been achieved. Air ticketing services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for air ticketing services booked through the Group. Commissions from air ticketing services rendered are recognized upon the delivery of the ticket to the customer, net of estimated cancellations. Estimated cancellations were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with EITF 99-19, as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risk, and has no obligations for cancelled airline ticket reservations. Contracts with certain airlines contain discretionary escalating commissions that are paid to the Group subject to achieving specific performance targets. Such discretionary escalating commissions are recognized on a cash basis because the Group cannot reasonably estimate such commissions. F-8 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Other travel services Prior to March 31, 2008, the Company also provided Chinese hotel inventory procurement, rating and availability negotiating service to Travelscape LLC (Travelscape), which is controlled by Expedia Inc. and recognized revenue when Travelscape confirmed the revenue sharing amount based on a pre-agreed commission sharing rate. Non- travel services Non-travel services primarily comprise wireless services and Internet-related advertising services. Revenue from Internet-related advertising contracts is recognized over the contractual advertisement display period. Revenue from the provision of wireless services is recognized when the services have been rendered, the amount can be reliably measured and there is no uncertainty of settlement with the telecom operators. The Companys subsidiaries and VIEs are subject to business tax and surcharges on the revenues generated from services rendered in China. Business tax and surcharges are recorded on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the consolidated statement of operations. (g) Income taxes Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or change in tax status is recognized in income in the period the change in tax rates or the tax law is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), the tax benefits associated with the utilization of pre-acquisition net operating losses carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was established at the date of the acquisition are recognized in the consolidated financial statements after the acquisition date as follows: (i) first to reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition; (ii) second to reduce to zero other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition; and (iii) third to reduce income tax expense. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), the impact of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is recognized in the financial statements if that position is not more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination based on the technical merits of the position. The Company has elected under APB Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income TaxesSpecial Areas (APB 23), to deem earnings and profits related to foreign subsidiary and VIEs as permanently reinvested. Accordingly, the Company has made no provision for income taxes that might result from repatriation of these earnings. As of December 31, 2008, the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiary and VIEs were RMB16,010,000. F-9 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (h) Share-based compensation Prior to January 1, 2006, the Group accounted for employee share-based arrangements using the preferable fair value recognition provision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). Effective January 1, 2006, the Group adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which replaced SFAS No. 123 and superseded APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25). The Group adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective approach, and accordingly, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, all grants of stock options and performance units are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values. The valuation provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, to awards granted to employees before the adoption of SFAS No. 123R whose related requisite services had not been provided, and to awards which were subsequently modified or cancelled. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 (SAB No. 107) relating to SFAS No. 123R. The Group has applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In December 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 110 (SAB 110). SAB 110 states that the staff will continue to accept, under certain circumstances, the use of the simplified method for estimating the expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) beyond December 31, 2007. Therefore, the Group continues to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term. SFAS No. 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Share-based compensation cost was recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense was recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. Previously under SFAS No. 123, to the extent awards were forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed in the period of forfeiture. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Group recorded a cumulative effect of RMB 282,072 to account for the expected forfeitures of share-based awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 for which the Group previously recorded as an expense. As required by SFAS No. 123R, a balance of RMB 27,618,582 of deferred compensation on January 1, 2006, date of adoption, was eliminated against additional paid-in capital. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Group applies the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted. Risk-free interest rates are based on US Treasury yield for the terms consistent with the expected life of award at the time of grant. Expected life is based on historical exercise patterns, which the Group believes are representative of future behavior. Expected dividend yield is determined in view of the Companys historical dividend payout rate. The Group estimates expected volatility at the date of grant based on a combination of historical volatilities and volatilities of comparable companies. The Group recognizes compensation cost on all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture and adjusted to reflect consideration for foreseeable future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. Compensation cost related to 2006, 2007 and 2008 employee Performance Units, which are awards in the form of units that are denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of the Companys ordinary shares, which number of units are determined based on the fair market value of the Companys ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date and which, when vested, are settled in either ordinary shares or cash. At the time of grant, the Companys board of directors or the compensation committee determines if the Company will settle the Performance Units in cash, shares or both. F-10 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Settlement terms of Performance Units, once established, may only be changed by approval of the Companys board of directors or the compensation committee. Except with respect to the Performance Units granted to each member of the board of directors who is not an employee of the Company or Expedia (or an Expedia affiliate) which are to be settled in cash, shares or both, Performance Units granted to employees during 2006 to 2008 are to be settled in ordinary shares. Those Performance Units granted during 2006 to 2008 to the Companys directors who are not employees of the Company or Expedia (or an Expedia affiliate) are to be settled upon vesting by shares or cash that is equal to the fair market value of the vested ordinary shares on the vesting date. Forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture and adjusted to reflect consideration for foreseeable future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. Share-based compensation awards which are settled in cash upon vesting are classified as liabilities and included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Compensation cost related to liability-classified awards is determined based on the current share price at the balance sheet date, and the proportionate amount of the requisite service that has been rendered to date. Changes in fair value of the liability-classified awards after the requisite service period has been completed and before awards are vested are immediately recognized as compensation cost in the period in which the change in fair value occurs. The Group accounts for equity instruments issued to each member of the board of directors who is not an employee of the Company or Expedia (or an Expedia affiliate) in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R and EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services (EITF 96-18). All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on which the counterpartys performance is completed. The Group uses the simplified method when calculating the expected life mainly because the Group does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected life due to the limited period of time the Groups shares have been publicly traded. (i) Loyalty points provision Platinum, VIP and regular eLong members earn loyalty points based on their usage of the Groups services. The Group provides travel awards and other non-cash gifts to the cardholders upon redemption of loyalty points that are accumulated based on the members transactions with the Group. The Group recognizes estimated costs to provide free travel and other non-cash gifts based on historical redemption rates. The liabilities for loyalty points are reduced upon the redemption or expiration of the loyalty points. The estimated costs are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations and the estimated liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. (j) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions. The Group considers highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All cash and cash equivalents are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use. (k) Short-term investment Short-term investment, as of December 31, 2008, represents time deposits of more than three months, generally six or nine months duration held in commercial banks of RMB615,809,729 (2007: Nil) and a held-to-maturity debt security of RMB20,000,000 (2007: 19,120,000) reported at amortized cost with a maturity of less than one year. The Company assesses changes in the value of the debt security to determine whether any decline is other-than-temporary and impairment exists. This assessment is made by considering available evidence including changes in general market conditions, specific industry and individual company data, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual company, and the Companys intent and ability to hold the debt security. F-11 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (l) Accounts receivable Accounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount and is non-interest bearing. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Groups best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Groups existing accounts receivable. The Group reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience, the aging of the accounts receivable balance and customer credit worthiness. Specific accounts are reviewed individually for collectability. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Group does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. (m) Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Group also capitalizes certain costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal-use software in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and EITF 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs. Costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives, taking into account any estimated residual value: Capitalized software development cost 3 years Computer equipment and system software 3-5 years Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over 1 to 4 years which represents the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the assets. (n) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. The Group follows the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. The Group performs its annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in December of each year. The Group evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. In determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill, the fair values of the tangible net assets and recognized and unrecognized intangible assets are deducted from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and is written down to its implied fair value. F-12 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life. The impairment test on indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. (o) Impairment of long-lived assets The Group evaluates for impairment of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including equipment and software, separately identifiable intangible assets which are subject to amortization and other non-current assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Assets to be disposed off would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less the costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. (p) Employee benefit plans Under PRC law, the Group participates in various defined contribution plans pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. The Group is required to make contributions to these plans at a stated contribution rates based on monthly compensation of qualified employees. The Group has no obligation for the payment of employee benefits associated with these plans beyond the contributions payable during the period of the employees employment with the Group. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Group contributed RMB16,212,136, RMB17,820,361 and RMB23,479,445, respectively to these plans. (q) Statutory reserves Under PRC law, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries are required to provide for certain statutory reserves, namely a general reserve, an enterprise expansion fund and a staff welfare and bonus fund. These subsidiaries are required to allocate at least 10% of their after tax profits on an individual company basis as determined under PRC GAAP to the general reserve and have the right to discontinue allocations to the general reserve if such reserve has reached 50% of registered capital on an individual company basis. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of these subsidiaries. The Companys VIEs in the PRC are also subject to similar statutory reserve requirements. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. As of December 31, 2008, the subsidiaries and VIEs in the PRC had appropriated RMB2,398,072 in general reserves and Nil in enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund. The appropriated general reserves have been included in accumulated deficit. (r) Net income/ (loss) per share Basic net income/ (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income/ (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income/ (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income/ (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, stock warrants and the settlement of Performance Units. Ordinary equivalent shares in the diluted net income/ (loss) per share computation are excluded in net loss periods as their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the calculation of basic net income/ (loss) and diluted net income/ (loss), ordinary shares include ordinary shares and high-vote ordinary shares. F-13 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (s) Advertising expense The Group incurs advertising expense consisting of radio, magazine and short messaging service (SMS) advertising, and online internet advertising expense to promote the Groups brand and services. The Group expenses the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. The Group expenses the costs of communicating the advertisement as incurred each time the advertisement is shown. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2008, the advertising expense was RMB12,393,014, RMB18,742,438 and RMB34,707,335, respectively, recorded as a component of sales and marketing expenses. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, the Group had RMB941,711 and RMB116,481, respectively, of prepaid marketing expenses which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. (t) Segment reporting The Group operates and manages its business as two reportable segmentsHotel and Air. In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segment of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Groups chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Group. The Group does not allocate any assets to its hotel and air segments as management does not use this information to measure the performance of the reportable segments. The Group generates substantially all revenues from customers in the PRC. Accordingly, no geographical segments are presented. (u) Operating leases The Group leases office space under operating lease agreements with original lease periods of up to four years. Rental expenses are recognized from the date of initial possession of the leased property on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain lease agreements contain rent holidays, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease renewal periods are considered on a lease-by-lease basis and are generally not included in the initial lease term. (v) Financial instruments Financial instruments of the Group are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, restricted assets, accounts receivable, short-term investments, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other payables. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, their carrying value approximated their fair value due to their short term nature. (w) Treasury stock During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Group repurchased 2,000,000 ADSs at a cost of US$15 million including brokerage commission. The ADSs repurchased by the Group are no longer outstanding. The repurchase of ADSs is accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. F-14 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (x) Recently issued accounting pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes requirements for the recognition and measurement of acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill, and non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests). SFAS No. 141R also provides disclosure requirements related to business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141R will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends ARB No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Group believes there will be no material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of SFAS No. 160. In December 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 110 (SAB 110). SAB 110 states that the staff will continue to accept, under certain circumstances, the use of the simplified method for estimating the expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) beyond December 31, 2007. Therefore, the Group continues to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 161), which is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities, including how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The Group does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. SFAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142-3). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). The intent of FSP FAS 142-3 is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141(R) and other applicable accounting literature. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Group does not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and provides entities with a framework for selecting the principles used in preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with GAAP. The Group does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. F-15 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (3) ACQUISITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Raytime In May 2006, the Group sold Raytime BVI and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Golden VIP, and ZM VIP (collectively, Raytime) for RMB1,500,000 to the original selling shareholders of Raytime. The sale proceeds were not received in cash, but reduced the remaining RMB4,000,000 payable by the Group to the original selling shareholders of Raytime by RMB1,500,000. The Group recorded a gain on disposal of RMB 2,649,682 in May 2006, representing the excess of the selling price over the carrying amount of the Groups investment in these entities on the date of sale. Online Dating Division During the third quarter of 2006, the Group sold its online dating business to Match.com, an entity under common control with the controlling shareholder of the Group, for US$14,625,000 (RMB114,780,017). As this transaction was between entities under common control, the proceeds in excess of the carrying value of the net assets sold of RMB 94,170,501 were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. The financial results of Raytime and the interactive online dating community businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and related disclosures. As a result, the footnote disclosures have been revised to exclude the amounts related to the financial results of the Raytime and interactive online dating community businesses. The consolidated statements of cash flows include both discontinued operations for all periods presented through the date of disposition. F-16 Table of Contents eLong, Inc.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, the Groups capitalized software development costs, including projects in progress, net of accumulated amortization, were RMB5,929,193 and RMB 13,803,961 respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Group recorded amortization relating to capitalized software development costs of RMB1,066,682 , RMB1,785,945 and RMB 2,964,220, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Group suspended its offering of vacation package products. As a result, the vacation package business property and equipment was written down to its fair value and the Group recognized a charge of RMB545,216 during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, after implementation of new system and business operation procedures, the Group determined that the replaced systems would no longer provide a future benefit and therefore changed the estimated useful lives of these assets to zero and recognized a charge of RMB984,814 for the year ended December 31, 2008, which is included in charges related to property and equipment and intangible assets. (7) GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and intangible assets consists of the following: December 31, 2007 2008 Goodwill 30,000,019 30,000,019 Intangible assets with definite lives, net 1,792,265 943,359 Intangible asset with indefinite life 400,000  Total intangible assets, net 2,192,265 943,359 The Groups goodwill arose from acquisitions in the previous years. As a result of the impairment tests undertaken of identifiable goodwill, no impairment charge for goodwill was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Group recorded impairment charges of RMB493,680, which is included in charges related to property and equipment and intangible assets, in relation to customer list of Fortune Trip. The impairment mainly resulted from a significant decline in forecasted sales and cash flows from Fortune Trip due to its inability to maintain active customers that contribute revenue to the Group. These factors resulted in the carrying value of the customer list being greater than its fair value, and therefore a write-down to fair value was required. No impairment charge for the customer list was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Groups indefinite-lived intangible asset is a trade name acquired in the acquisition of Fortune Trip. The Group does not intend to actively use the Fortune Trip trade name. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Group recorded an impairment charge for the remaining value of the trade name of RMB400,000, which is included in charges related to property and equipment and intangible assets.

Cayman Under the current laws of Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on their income or capital gains. In addition, no Cayman Islands withholding tax is imposed upon any payments of dividends. China Prior to January 1, 2008 the Companys subsidiaries and VIEs in China were subject to Corporate Income Tax (CIT) at a rate of 33%. As described below, certain of the Companys subsidiaries and VIEs were subject to preferential rates ranging from 15% to 27% and income tax holidays. eLongNet Information Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (eLong Information), a subsidiary of the Group, obtained the status of a High New Technology Enterprise in November 2006 and was entitled to a preferential CIT rate of 15% from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2007. Beijing eLong Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing Information), a VIE of the Group, obtained the status of a High New Technology Enterprise that entitled it to a preferential CIT rate of 15% from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007. Beijing Information was also granted a tax holiday for exemption of CIT for three years from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003, and with a 50% reduction in CIT liabilities (i.e. effectively at 7.5% tax rate) from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006. F-20 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Further, certain branches of the VIEs are taxed at 27% of deemed taxable income. The taxable income is determined based on the deemed profit method with the current deemed profit rate of 10%. In March 2007, the PRC enacted a new CIT Law and promulgated related regulations which were effective January 1, 2008, which imposes a unified income tax rate of 25% for both domestic and foreign invested enterprises. The newly enacted laws also provided for certain enterprises to qualify for the status of a High New Technology Enterprise and enjoy a preferential CIT rate of 15%. eLong Information and Beijing Information have been certified as High New Technology Enterprise under the new CIT law by the relevant authorities for fiscal year 2008. Therefore, eLong Information and Beijing Information enjoy a reduced CIT rate of 15% for fiscal year of 2008. In addition, Hangzhou eLong Air Service Co., Ltd. is taxed at 25% of deemed taxable income which is determined based on the deemed profit method with the current deemed profit rate of 10%. Shenzhen branch of Beijing eLong Air Services Co., Ltd. is taxed at 18% based on Regulations on Special Economic Zones in Guangdong Province. The new CIT Law also imposes a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside the PRC, which were exempted under the previous income tax laws and rules. The 10% withholding tax rate can be further reduced based on the tax arrangement/tax treaty between China and the other respective jurisdiction. The undistributed earnings generated before January 1, 2008 shall be exempted from withholding tax when such earnings are distributed to the foreign investor in the year 2008 or thereafter. The Companys specific subsidiary is currently in a profit position but the APB23 exception retained by SFAS No. 109 is applicable to the Company as sufficient evidence shows that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2008, the Group has not recorded any withholding tax. Under the new CIT Law, a company incorporated outside of the PRC, but having effective management in the PRC will be considered a PRC tax resident and will be subject to PRC CIT on its worldwide income. The Implementation Regulations of the new CIT Law further define effective management as the substantive comprehensive management and control of the production, business, personnel, finance and assets of a company. Currently, Expedia, Inc., through Expedia Asia Pacific-Alpha Limited, controls approximately 96% of the voting power of the Companys voting stock. In addition, certain other shareholders are parties to an investors agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific-Alpha Limited under which they have agreed to vote their ordinary shares in the election of directors designated by Expedia, Inc. Accordingly, Expedia, Inc. generally is able to exercise control over all matters requiring approval by our board of directors or our shareholders. Nevertheless, it is possible that the PRC tax authorities would treat eLong, Inc. as a PRC tax resident, and, if so, that the Company would be subject to PRC CIT on its worldwide income and that such determination may have retroactive effect.

Income tax expense (benefit) differed from the amounts computed by applying the PRC enterprise income tax rate of 33% for 2006 and 2007, and 25% for 2008 to pretax income (loss) from continuing operations as a result of the following: For the year ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Computed expected tax (benefit) expense at PRC statutory rates 789,073 (8,186,016 ) (18,399,863 ) Increase (reduction) in income taxes resulting from: Change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets allocated to income tax expense (2,199,694 ) 80,809 5,148,973 Adjustment to deferred tax assets and liabilities for changes in enacted tax rates 1,685,801 (3,180 ) 459,128 Expired net operating loss carry forwards  314,985 286,655 Effect of tax exemption and reduction inside PRC (115,680 )   Effect of differing tax rates in different jurisdictions inside PRC (2,100,638 ) (78,000 ) 3,009,342 Effect of differing tax rates in jurisdiction outside PRC 2,468,024 7,471,113 11,873,654 Prior year tax return true up  (1,064,117 ) 169,787 Non deductible entertainment expenses 160,214 90,453 115,547 Non deductible personnel expenses 1,768,487 1,123,265  Non deductible allowance for doubtful accounts 97,612 576,746 366,536 Nonqualified tax deductions 243,759 187,450  Others 38,301 371,835 (36,081 ) Income tax expense 2,835,259 885,343 2,993,678 F-22 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) The Groups effective tax rate from continuing operations was 118.6%, (3.6%), (4.1%) in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. According to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations is three years for underpayment of taxes due to computational errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. The statute of limitations will be extended to five years under special circumstances, which are not clearly defined. In the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitations is three years, and will be extended to ten years under special circumstances, which are not clearly defined. There is no statute of limitations in the case of tax evasion. The Groups 2004 to 2008 tax returns remain subject to examination by the PRC tax authorities. The Group did not have any unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2008, and it does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next 12 months. No interest or penalty related to unrecognized uncertain tax positions was recorded in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 consolidated financial statements. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below. For the year ended December 31, 2007 2008 Deferred tax assets: Operating loss carryforwards 1,045,976 3,365,883 Operating loss carryforwards, pre-acquisition 1,127,070 1,136,556 Property and equipment 255,741 110,030 Accrued expenses 3,750,254 2,830,607 Total gross deferred tax assets 6,179,041 7,443,076 Less: valuation allowance (1,675,617 ) (6,824,590 ) Net deferred tax assets 4,503,424 618,486 Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible asset with indefinite life 100,000  Intangible assets with definite lives 516,486 235,842 Restricted assets 2,677,615  Total deferred tax liabilities 3,294,101 235,842 Total net deferred tax assets 1,209,323 382,644 Deferred tax assets, net:  Current, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,072,639 22,924  Non-current, included in other non-current assets 236,684 359,720 Deferred tax liabilities, included in other liabilities: 100,000  The amount included in the change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase (decrease) in the beginning-of-the-year balance of the valuation allowance because the Company utilized the net operating loss carryforwards before 2006, the partial net operating loss carryforward expired in 2007 and cumulative book losses in recent years including 2008 caused a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years. Such amounts were RMB(387,167), RMB598,915 and RMB1,034,991 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and were primarily due to certain allowances for accrued expenses and net operation loss carryforward. The gross amount of operating loss carryforwards which will expire between 2009 and 2013 are as follows: RMB2,414,459 in 2009, RMB4,122,083 in 2010, RMB648,367 in 2011, RMB420,273 in 2012, and RMB16, 687,585 in 2013. Goodwill was reduced by RMB4,083,112, nil and nil for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, for the utilization of acquired tax benefits that were previously reduced by the valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of valuation allowance associated with pre-acquisition net operating losses was RMB900,714. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible or utilized. The Group considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon an assessment of the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible or can be utilized, management has provided a valuation allowance of RMB1,675,617 and RMB6,824,590 as of December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. F-23 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) After reducing the deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance, the deferred tax assets were RMB1,309,323 and RMB382,644 as of December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, which represent the deferred tax assets of entities that have been profitable and therefore are more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. (11) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCY The Group has several non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office rent. Payments under operating leases, including periodic rent escalation, are charged as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2008 are: Minimum lease payments 2009 11,689,329 2010 10,430,218 2011 10,154,346 2012 9,445,518 2013  Total 41,719,411 Rental expenses incurred under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 amounted to RMB9,643,785, RMB11,183,306 and RMB11,303,649, respectively. (12) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Stock options In April 2001, the Company adopted the stock option plan (the 2001 Plan) pursuant to which the Companys Board of Directors may grant stock options to selected directors, officers, key employees and consultants of the Group. The Plan authorizes the Company to grant options to purchase up to 4,000,000 ordinary shares. On August 26, 2003, the Company increased the number of ordinary shares authorized to be issued under the 2001 Stock Option Plan to 5,500,000. In July 2004, the Company adopted a stock and annual incentive plan (the 2004 Plan) that allows the Board of Directors to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or Performance Units to officers, employees, directors or consultants of the Group to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of ordinary shares. On December 13, 2006, the Company amended the 2004 Plan to allow grant of Performance Units to non-employees under the 2004 Plan. The options under both the 2001 Plan and 2004 Plan have a contractual life of ten years and generally vest and become exercisable ratably over three to five years from the date of grant, except the options granted in 2001 which do not require future services nor contain a performance or market condition and are expensed on the grant date.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) The aggregated intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2008 was calculated based on the closing price of the Companys ordinary shares on December 31, 2008 of US$7.10 per ADS (equivalent to US$3.55 per share). The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 was US$1.4 million, US$0.6 million and US$0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, there was RMB25,060,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of 3.8 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost may be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. Expedia Options On August 4, 2004, in connection with the sale of the Series B preferred shares, the Company issued to Expedia Asia Pacific an option to purchase 711,429 ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$5.25 per share. The option mirrors the terms and conditions of the 1.66 million options granted to certain of the Companys employees and officers on July 23, 2004 under the 2004 Plan. The option becomes exercisable by Expedia Asia Pacific each time any such officer or employee exercises any of such 1.66 million options. In connection with each exercise by an employee or officer, Expedia Asia Pacific is entitled to exercise a portion of its option such that Expedia Asia Pacific would receive (if Expedia Asia Pacific exercises to the fullest extent in connection with such employee or officer exercise) 30% of the aggregate ordinary shares issued to such employee or officer and Expedia Asia Pacific in connection with such employee or officer exercise. To the extent that any such officers or employees options terminate or expire without being exercised, an amount of Expedia Asia Pacifics option equal to 30% of (i) such officers or employees terminated or expired options divided by (ii) 0.70, will likewise terminate or expire. As of December 31, 2008, 554,893 options granted to Expedia Asia Pacific on August 4, 2004 had been forfeited as a result of the forfeiture or expiration of the options of the relevant eLong employees. As of December 31, 2008, Expedia Asia Pacific held an option to purchase up to 156,536 ordinary shares. In addition, on October 1, 2004, the Company entered into a stock option agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific pursuant to which, in exchange for Expedia Asia Pacific giving its consent to the issuance of 250,000 options to certain of the Companys officers, the Company granted Expedia Asia Pacific an option to purchase up to 260,204 of the Companys ordinary shares at a purchase price of US$5.25 per share. The option mirrors the provision of 250,000 options granted to the Companys officers on October 1, 2004. As of December 31,2008, all of these options have been forfeited. The 260,204 Expedia Asia Pacific options were classified as a liability and re-measured to its fair value each reporting period until settlement. As of December 2007 and 2008, the liability corresponding to the Expedia Asia Pacific options was RMB114,850 and nil, respectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Performance Units Performance Units are rights to receive the Companys ordinary shares, or in some cases, a cash award linked to the Companys ordinary share value. Most Performance Units vest ratably over a five-year period, are not entitled to dividends or voting rights, and are generally converted to ordinary shares upon vesting on a one-for-one basis. When the Performance Unit grants are settled in cash, the cash amount is set at the equivalent of the fair market value of the number of the Companys ordinary shares that the grantee would have received on a particular vesting date, had the grant been settled in shares. The cost of the Performance Unit awards was determined using the fair value (based on the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date) of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of grant, net of expected forfeitures, and compensation cost was recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. The balance for the cash settled performance units of RMB278,036 has been included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. A summary of equity-settled Performance Units activity under the 2004 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 is as follows: Weighted average Number of Shares grant date fair value Balance at December 31, 2006 294,924 US$ 6.37 Granted 545,880 US$ 4.83 Settled (17,154 ) US$ 6.46 Forfeited (297,422 ) US$ 5.92 Cancelled (1,856 ) US$ 7.12 Balance at December 31, 2007 524,372 US$ 5.02 Granted 1,056,796 US$ 4.02 Settled (140,954 ) US$ 5.14 Forfeited (257,258 ) US$ 4.51 Cancelled   Balance at December 31, 2008 1,182,956 US$ 4.22 Fully vested and exercisable as of December 31, 2008 30,156 US$ 4.31 A summary of cash-settled Performance Units activity under the 2004 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 is as follows: Number of Shares Balance at December 31, 2006 30,000 Granted 20,000 Settled  Forfeited (6,666 ) Cancelled  Balance at December 31, 2007 43,334 Granted 75,328 Settled (36,664 ) Forfeited (3,334 ) Cancelled  Balance at December 31, 2008 78,664 Fully vested and exercisable as of December 31, 2008  Share based compensation allocation for the year end December 31 2006, 2007, 2008 is as follows: For the year ended December31, 2006 2007 2008 Cost of services 135,095 210,764 324,824 Service development 2,760,459 2,983,797 2,320,096 Sales and marketing 572,952 680,315 972,150 General and administrative 8,752,915 2,127,186 3,506,869 Total 12,221,421 6,002,062 7,123,939 F-27 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Warrants In August 2003, the Company issued warrants to purchase 600,000 of the Companys ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$0.75 per share to Broadband Capital Management LLC (Broadband), and two outside consultants, in consideration for investment banking services provided to the Company in respect of the private placement of US$15 million aggregate principal amount of Series A preferred shares in August 2003. The Company accounted for the warrants issued to Broadband and the two consultants in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF 96-18. The fair value of the warrants granted was RMB4,818,960 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (excluding a volatility assumption as the Company was a non-public entity at the date the warrants were issued). The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the warrants included an expected dividend yield of 0%, a risk free interest rate of 2.9%, and an expected life of 10 years. The estimated fair value of the warrants of RMB4,818,960 was charged against the gross proceeds of the Series A preferred shares as such costs were incremental and specifically and directly attributable to the actual placement of such securities. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, no warrants were exercised into ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, the number of warrants outstanding and exercisable was 15,121, of which 15,000 warrants were exercised in February 2009. (13) ORDINARY SHARES Ordinary Shares During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Company issued 319,922, 209,872 and 195,018 ordinary shares to certain of its option and Performance Units holders for an aggregate exercise price of US$772,628 (RMB6,094,307), US$410,583 (RMB3,149,851) and US$77,747 (RMB556,943), respectively. Since 2006, to facilitate the employee stock option exercise process, the Company issued depositary shares to its brokers. These shares are not considered outstanding until issued to the employees as a result of the exercise of stock options. As of December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, 915,042, 755,170 and 560,152 depositary shares were issued to brokers and not to the shareholders. High-Vote Ordinary Shares Expedia Asia Pacific or its affiliate, Expedia, held 11,188,570 high-vote ordinary shares as a result of the automatic conversion on December 17, 2004 of all outstanding Series B Preferred Shares. Expedia Asia Pacific beneficially holds 28,550,704 high-vote ordinary shares, which constitute all of the Companys outstanding high-vote ordinary shares and, as a result, controls approximately 95% and 96% of the voting power of all shares of the Companys voting stock as of December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. In addition, certain other shareholders are parties to an investor agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific under which they have agreed to vote their ordinary shares in the election of directors designated by Expedia Asia Pacific. Expedia Asia Pacific has the ability to control the composition of the Companys Board of Directors, including the ability to nominate new or replacement directors and vote their shares to elect them and the right to vote their shares to remove members of the Board of Directors. The rights of the ordinary shares and high-vote ordinary shares are the same except that each high-vote ordinary share is entitled to 15 votes, whereas each ordinary share is entitled to one vote. Treasury stock From the commencement of the Companys share buyback program in March 2008 through December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 2,000,000 ADSs at a cost of USD$15.0 million (RMB103.4 million).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) (14) EARNINGS (LOSS) PER ORDINARY SHARE Potentially dilutive securities that could potentially dilute basic earnings per ordinary share include stock options and Performance Units granted to employees, directors and non-employees and stock warrants granted to non-employees. In 2007 and 2008, ordinary equivalent shares in the diluted loss per ordinary share computation are excluded as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per ordinary share have been calculated as follows: For the year ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Net income (loss) applicable to ordinary shareholders 1,040,411 (25,587,611 ) (76,593,132 ) Denominator for basic income (loss) per share: Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 50,391,885 50,756,869 49,784,263 Denominator for diluted income (loss) per share: 53,749,470 50,756,869 49,784,263 Basic income (loss) per share 0.02 (0.51 ) (1.54 ) Diluted income (loss) per share 0.02 (0.51 ) (1.54 ) (15) CONCENTRATION OF RISKS Credit and concentration risks The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and prepaid expenses and other current assets represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, substantially all of the Groups cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in major financial institutions located in the PRC, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the United States, which management believes are of generally high credit quality. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and denominated in RMB, and are derived from revenues earned from operations arising in the PRC. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Group maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and actual losses have been within managements expectations. The Group has a diversified base of customers. No individual customer contributed to more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2007 and 2008. The Group does not have concentrations of available sources of labors, services, franchises, licenses or other rights that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact its operations. Business and economic risks The Groups business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including risks relating to the condition of the economy, outbreak of disease or the occurrence of natural or man-made disaster, dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud. The Group conducts its principal operations in the PRC and accordingly is subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with investments in equity securities of United States and Western European companies. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, legal environment and social uncertainties in the PRC, influence of the China National Tourism Administration over certain aspects of the Groups operations and competition in the travel agency industry. The Group is currently targeting the Chinese market. The Chinese government regulates internet access, the distribution of online news and other information, the provision of online commerce and provision of travel agency services through strict business licensing requirements and other governmental regulations. These regulations include limiting foreign ownership in Chinese companies providing Internet access, information and other online Internet services and travel agency services. Management, after consultation and advice from PRC legal counsel, is of the opinion that the Groups business complies with existing Chinese laws and regulations. However, the interpretation and application of current or proposed requirements and regulations may have an adverse effect on the Groups business, financial condition and result of operations. Foreign exchange risk. The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political and economic conditions. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the Peoples Bank of China. Currently, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. In the future, the PRC government may adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in increased exchange rate volatility and a significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts in Renminbi (RMB) Substantially all of our revenue-generating operations are transacted in Renminbi, and we have a significant portion of our financial assets denominated in U.S. dollars. If the Renminbi appreciates we will record unrealized exchange losses on United States dollar-denominated assets and these losses could be material to our results of operations. In addition, any changes in the value of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect the value in foreign currency terms of our ADSs and any dividends payable by us. (16) SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group operates Hotel and Air segments. All of the Groups long-lived assets are located in the PRC. These reportable segments are business units that offer different products that are managed separately because each requires different service provision and marketing strategies. The Hotel segment mainly provides the services to customers for the reservation with hotels and the Air segment provides the services to customers for the air tickets booking with airline companies. Others segment provides internet-related advertising services and other travel services. The Group determined its segments based on how the Groups chief operating decision maker manages the Groups business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance. The Group has allocated settlement processing function charges to Hotel and Air segments and also the share-based compensation from the Others segment to Corporate to determine the segment profit or loss from 2008. The corresponding information for 2006 and 2007 has been restated as it is practicable to do so. A summary of the results of the reportable segments with all historical amounts reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2008 Hotel Air Others Corporate Total(RMB) Revenues 253,457,540 77,205,429 17,762,577  348,425,546 Business tax and surcharges (12,672,877 ) (4,246,299 ) (4,193,541 )  (21,112,717 ) Cost of services * (39,093,304 ) (53,365,857 ) (4,212,324 ) (324,824 ) (96,996,309 ) Service development expenses * (12,914,857 ) (5,258,409 ) (6,258,828 ) (28,151,947 ) (52,584,041 ) Total contribution 188,776,502 14,334,864 3,097,884 (28,476,771 ) 177,732,479 Unallocated operating expenses Sales and marketing (163,528,250 ) (163,528,250 ) General and administrative (3,398,572 ) (3,398,572 ) (46,855,283 ) (53,652,427 ) Amortization of intangibles (848,906 ) (848,906 ) Charges related to property and equipment and intangible assets (1,384,814 ) (1,384,814 ) Income(loss) from operations 185,377,930 10,936,292 3,097,884 (241,094,024 ) (41,681,918 ) Total other income (expenses), net (31,917,536 ) (31,917,536 ) Income(loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 185,377,930 10,936,292 3,097,884 (273,011,560 ) (73,599,454 ) * Depreciation expense of RMB6,508,451 and RMB4,293,288 is included in Cost of services and Service development expenses for the Hotel and Air segments.

Subject to Section 1(h), any determination made by the Committee or by an appropriately delegated officer pursuant to delegated authority under the provisions of the Plan with respect to any Award shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee or such delegate at the time of the grant of the Award or, unless in contravention of any express term of the Plan, at any time thereafter. All decisions made by the Committee, or any officer with appropriately delegated authority, pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, including the Company, Participants, and Eligible Individuals. (d) Award Agreements. The terms and conditions of each Award, as determined by the Committee, shall be set forth in an Award Agreement, which shall be delivered to the Participant receiving such Award upon, or as promptly as is reasonably practicable following, the grant of such Award. The effectiveness of an Award shall not be subject to the Award Agreements being signed by the Company and/or the Participant receiving the Award unless specifically so provided in the Award Agreement. Award Agreements may be amended only in accordance with Section 11 hereof. SECTION 3. Ordinary Shares Subject to Plan (a) Plan Maximums. The maximum number of Ordinary Shares that may be delivered pursuant to Awards under the Plan shall be 3,000,000 (three million).

The Committee may set limits on the maximum number of Awards which any Participant may be granted during the term of the Plan. (c) Rules for Calculating Shares Delivered. (i) To the extent that any Award is forfeited, or any Option and the related Tandem SAR (if any) or Free-Standing SAR terminates, expires or lapses without being exercised, or any Award is settled for cash, the Shares subject to such Awards not delivered as a result thereof shall again be available for Awards under the Plan. (ii) If the exercise price of any Option and/or the tax withholding obligations relating to any Award are satisfied by delivering Ordinary Shares to the Company (by either actual delivery or by attestation), only the number of Ordinary Shares issued net of the Shares delivered or attested to shall be deemed delivered for purposes of the limits set forth in Section 3(a). To the extent any Ordinary Shares subject to an Award are withheld to satisfy the exercise price (in the case of an Option) and/or the tax withholding obligations relating to such Award, such Shares shall not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of the limits set forth in Section 3(a). - 6 - (d) Adjustment Provision. In the event of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or shares, liquidation, Disaffiliation, or similar event affecting the Company or any of its Affiliates (each a Corporate Transaction), the Committee or the Board may in its discretion make such substitutions or adjustments as it deems appropriate or equitable to (i) the aggregate number and kind of Shares or other securities reserved for issuance and delivery under the Plan, (ii) the various maximum limitations set forth in Sections 3(a) and 3(b) upon certain types of Awards and upon the grants to individuals of certain types of Awards, (iii) the number and kind of Shares of other securities subject to outstanding Awards; and (iv) the exercise price of outstanding Options and Share Appreciation Rights. In the event of a share dividend, share split, reverse share split, share rights offering, separation, spinoff, reorganization, extraordinary dividend of cash or other property, share combination, or recapitalization or similar event affecting the capital structure of the Company (each, a Share Change), the Committee or the Board shall make such substitutions or adjustments as it deems equitable to (i) the aggregate number and kind of Shares or other securities reserved for issuance and delivery under the Plan, (ii) the various maximum limitations set forth in Sections 3(a) and 3(b) upon certain types of Awards and upon the grants to individuals of certain types of Awards, (iii) the number and kind of Shares or other securities subject to outstanding Awards; and (iv) the exercise price of outstanding Options and Share Appreciation Rights. In the case of Corporate Transactions, such adjustments may include, without limitation, (1) the cancellation of outstanding Awards in exchange for payments of cash, property or a combination thereof having an aggregate value equal to the value of such Awards, as determined by the Committee or the Board in its sole discretion (it being understood that in the case of a Corporate Transaction with respect to which holders of Ordinary Shares receive consideration other than publicly traded equity securities of the ultimate surviving entity, any such determination by the Committee that the value of an Option or Share Appreciation Right shall for this purpose be deemed to equal the excess, if any, of the value of the consideration being paid for each Share pursuant to such Corporate Transaction over the exercise price of such Option or Share Appreciation Right shall conclusively be deemed valid); (2) the substitution of other property (including, without limitation, cash or other securities of the Company and securities of entities other than the Company) for the Shares subject to outstanding Awards; and (3) in connection with any Disaffiliation, arranging for the assumption of Awards, or replacement of Awards with new awards based on other property or other securities (including, without limitation, other securities of the Company and securities of entities other than the Company), by the affected Affiliate or division or by the entity that controls such Affiliate or division following such Disaffiliation (as well as any corresponding adjustments to Awards that remain based upon Company securities). Any adjustment under this Section 3(d) need not be the same for all Participants. (e) Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 3(d) to Awards to United States taxpayers that are considered deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; (ii) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 3(d) to Awards to United States taxpayers that are not considered deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment, the Awards either (A) continue not to be subject to Section 409A of the Code or (B) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; and (iii) in any event, neither the Committee nor the Board shall have the authority to make any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(d) to the extent the existence of such authority would cause an Award to a United States taxpayer that is not intended to be subject to Section 409A of the Code at the Grant Date to be subject thereto. - 7 - SECTION 4. Eligibility Awards may be granted under the Plan to Eligible Individuals; provided, however, that Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries or parent corporation (within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code). SECTION 5. Options and Share Appreciation Rights (a) Types of Options. The Award Agreement for an Option granted to a United States taxpayer that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall so state. All other Options will be Nonqualified Options. (b) Types and Nature of Share Appreciation Rights. Share Appreciation Rights may be Tandem SARs, which are granted in conjunction with an Option, or Free-Standing SARs, which are not granted in conjunction with an Option. Upon the exercise of a Share Appreciation Right, the Participant shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, Ordinary Shares, or both, in value equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of one Ordinary Share over the exercise price of the applicable Share Appreciation Right, multiplied by (ii) the number of Ordinary Shares in respect of which the Share Appreciation Right has been exercised. The applicable Award Agreement shall specify whether such payment is to be made in cash or Ordinary Shares or both, or shall reserve to the Committee or the Participant the right to make that determination prior to or upon the exercise of the Share Appreciation Right. (c) Tandem SARs. A Tandem SAR may be granted at the Grant Date of the related Option. A Tandem SAR shall be exercisable only at such time or times and to the extent that the related Option is exercisable in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5, and shall have the same exercise price as the related Option. A Tandem SAR shall terminate or be forfeited upon the exercise or forfeiture of the related Option, and the related Option shall terminate or be forfeited upon the exercise or forfeiture of the Tandem SAR. (d) Exercise Price. The exercise price per Ordinary Share subject to an Option or Free-Standing SAR shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, and shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of an Ordinary Share on the applicable Grant Date. In no event may any Option or Free-Standing SAR granted under this Plan be amended, other than pursuant to Section 3(d), to decrease the exercise price thereof or otherwise be subject to any action that would be treated, for accounting purposes, as a repricing of such Option or Free-Standing SAR, unless such amendment, cancellation, or action is approved by the Board or the Companys shareholders. - 8 - (e) Term. The Term of each Option and each Free-Standing SAR shall be fixed by the Committee, but shall not exceed ten years from the Grant Date in the case of an Incentive Stock Option. (f) Vesting and Exercisability. Except as otherwise provided herein, Options and Free-Standing SARs shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee. If the Committee provides that any Option or Free-Standing SAR will become exercisable only in installments, the Committee may at any time waive such installment exercise provisions, in whole or in part, based on such factors as the Committee may determine. In addition, the Committee may at any time accelerate the exercisability of any Option or Free-Standing SAR. (g) Method of Exercise. Subject to the provisions of this Section 5, Options and Free-Standing SARs may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time during the applicable Term by giving written notice of exercise to the Company or through procedures established by a third-party Option administrator appointed by the Company specifying the number of Shares as to which the Option or Free-Standing SAR is being exercised; provided, however, that, unless otherwise permitted by the Committee, any such exercise must be with respect to a portion of the applicable Option or Free-Standing SAR relating to no less than the lesser of the number of Shares then subject to such Option or Free-Standing SAR or 100 Shares. In the case of the exercise of an Option, such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price (which shall equal the product of such number of Shares multiplied by the applicable exercise price) by certified or bank check or such other instrument as the Company may accept. If approved by the Committee, payment, in full or in part, may also be made as follows: (i) Payments may be made in the form of unrestricted Shares (by delivery of such Shares or by attestation) of the same class as the Shares subject to the Option already owned by the Participant (based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date the Option is exercised); provided, however, that, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the right to make a payment in the form of already owned Shares of the same class as the Common Stock subject to the Option may be authorized only at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted. (ii) To the extent permitted by applicable law, payment may be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Company, together with a copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay the purchase price, and, if requested, the amount of any federal, state, local or foreign taxes. To facilitate the foregoing, the Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, enter into agreements for coordinated procedures with one or more brokerage firms. - 9 - (iii) Payment may be made by instructing the Committee to withhold a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value (based on the Fair Market Value of the Ordinary Shares on the date the applicable Option is exercised) equal to the sum of (A) the product of the exercise price multiplied by the number of Shares in respect of which the Option shall have been exercised and (B) any other related fees or charges, including but not limited to, fees related to the transfer of ADSs or the conversion of Ordinary Shares to ADSs, if the Committee in its discretion determines to deliver ADSs. (h) Delivery; Rights of Shareholders. No Shares may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of an Option until the exercise price therefor has been fully paid and applicable taxes and other fees or charges have been withheld. The applicable Participant shall have all of the rights of a shareholder of the Company holding Shares of the class or series that is subject to the Option or Share Appreciation Right (including, if applicable, the right to vote the applicable Shares and the right to receive dividends), when the Participant (i) has given written notice of exercise, (ii) if requested, has given the representation described in Section 13(a), and (iii) in the case of an Option, has paid in full for such Shares. (i) Termination of Employment. Subject to Section 10(c), a Participants Options and Share Appreciation Rights shall be forfeited upon such Participants Termination of Employment, except as set forth below: (i) upon a Participants Termination of Employment by reason of death, any Option or Share Appreciation Right held by the Participant that was exercisable immediately before the Termination of Employment may be exercised at any time until the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of the date of such death and (B) the expiration of the Term thereof; (ii) upon a Participants Termination of Employment by reason of Disability or Retirement, any Option or Share Appreciation Right held by the Participant that was exercisable immediately before the Termination of Employment may be exercised at any time until the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of such Termination of Employment and (B) the expiration of the Term thereof; (iii) upon a Participants Termination of Employment for Cause, any Option or Share Appreciation Right held by the Participant shall be forfeited, effective as of such Termination of Employment; (iv) upon a Participants Termination of Employment for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement or for Cause, any Option or Share Appreciation Right held by the Participant that was exercisable immediately before the Termination of Employment may be exercised at any time until the earlier of (A) the 90th day following such Termination of Employment and (B) expiration of the Term thereof; and - 10 - (v) notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 5(i), if a Participant dies after such Participants Termination of Employment but while any Option or Share Appreciation Right remains exercisable as set forth above, such Option or Share Appreciation Right may be exercised at any time until the later of (A) the earlier of (1) the first anniversary of the date of such death and (2) expiration of the Term thereof and (B) the last date on which such Option or Share Appreciation Right would have been exercisable, absent this Section 5(i)(v). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have the power, in its discretion, to apply different rules concerning the consequences of a Termination of Employment; provided, however, that if such rules are less favorable to the Participant than those set forth above, such rules are set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. (j) Nontransferability of Options and Share Appreciation Rights. No Option or Free-Standing SAR shall be transferable by a Participant other than (i) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) in the case of a Nonqualified Option or Free-Standing SAR, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order or as otherwise expressly permitted by the Committee including, if so permitted, pursuant to a transfer to the Participants family members or to a charitable organization, whether directly or indirectly or by means of a trust or partnership or otherwise; or (iii) with the prior consent and subject to any conditions the Committee may impose. For purposes of this Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, family member shall have the meaning given to such term in General Instructions A.1(a)(5) to Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any successor thereto. A Tandem SAR shall be transferable only with the related Option as permitted by the preceding sentence. Any Option or Share Appreciation Right shall be exercisable, subject to the terms of this Plan, only by the applicable Participant, the guardian or legal representative of such Participant, or any person to whom such Option or Share Appreciation Right is permissibly transferred pursuant to this Section 5(j), it being understood that the term Participant includes such guardian, legal representative and other transferee; provided, however, that the term Termination of Employment shall continue to refer to the Termination of Employment of the original Participant. SECTION 6. Restricted Shares (a) Nature of Awards and Certificates. Restricted Shares are actual Shares issued to a Participant, and shall be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration or issuance of one or more share certificates. Any certificate issued in respect of Restricted Shares shall be registered in the name of the applicable Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Award, substantially in the following form: The transferability of this certificate and the ordinary shares represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture) of the eLong, Inc. 2009 Share and Annual Incentive Plan and an award agreement. Copies of such plan and agreement are on file at the offices of eLong, Inc. - 11 - The Committee may require that the certificates evidencing such Shares be held in custody by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and that, as a condition of any Award of Restricted Shares, the applicable Participant shall have delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Ordinary Shares covered by such Award. (b) Terms and Conditions. Restricted Shares shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: (i) The Committee may condition the grant or vesting of an Award upon the attainment of Performance Goals. The Committee may also condition the grant or vesting thereof upon the continued service of the Participant. The conditions for grant or vesting and the other provisions of Restricted Share Awards (including without limitation any applicable Performance Goals) need not be the same with respect to each Participant. The Committee may at any time, in its sole discretion, accelerate or waive, in whole or in part, any of the foregoing restrictions. (ii) Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, during the period, if any, set by the Committee, commencing with the date of such Restricted Share Award for which such Participants continued service is required (the Restriction Period), and until the later of (A) the expiration of the Restriction Period and (B) the date the applicable Performance Goals (if any) are satisfied, the Participant shall not be permitted to sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber Restricted Shares.

If so determined by the Committee in the applicable Award Agreement and subject to Section 13(e), (A) cash dividends on the class or series of Shares that is the subject of the Restricted Share Award shall be automatically deferred and reinvested in additional Restricted Shares, held subject to the vesting of the underlying Restricted Shares, and (B) subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 3(d), dividends payable in Ordinary Shares shall be paid in the form of Restricted Shares of the same class as the Ordinary Shares with which such dividend was paid, held subject to the vesting of the underlying Restricted Shares. - 12 - (iv) Except as otherwise set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, upon a Participants Termination of Employment for any reason during the Restriction Period or before the applicable Performance Goals are satisfied, all Restricted Shares still subject to restriction shall be forfeited by such Participant; provided, however, that the Committee shall have the discretion to waive, in whole or in part, any or all remaining restrictions with respect to any or all of such Participants Shares. (v) If and when any applicable Performance Goals are satisfied and the Restriction Period expires without a prior forfeiture of the Restricted Shares for which legended certificates have been issued, unlegended certificates for such Shares shall be delivered to the Participant upon surrender of the legended certificates. SECTION 7. Restricted Share Units (a) Nature of Award. Restricted Share Units are Awards denominated in Ordinary Shares that will be settled, subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the Restricted Share Units, either by delivery of Shares to the Participant or by the payment of cash based upon the Fair Market Value of a specified number of Ordinary Shares. (b) Terms and Conditions.

The Committee may also condition the vesting thereof upon the continued service of the Participant. The conditions for grant or vesting and the other provisions of Restricted Share Units (including without limitation any applicable Performance Goals) need not be the same with respect to each recipient. The Committee may at any time, in its sole discretion, accelerate or waive, in whole or in part, any of the foregoing restrictions.

Unless required by PRC law, the shareholders of Beijing Information and Asia Media will not declare dividends or distribute bonuses during the contract period of the Loan Agreement.

Pursuant to the Exclusive Purchase Right Agreement, the shareholders of Beijing Information and Asia Media confirm that total consideration received from the transfer of the shares or sale of assets of Beijing Information and Asia Media shall first be applied to the outstanding loan balance under the Loan agreement. Any remaining consideration, after full repayment of the loan, will be remitted in full to eLong, Inc. as a nonreciprocal transfer. If such transfer is prohibited by PRC law, the shareholders will remit the consideration to the Company or its designees in a manner permitted under applicable law. 3. The Company agrees to provide Beijing Information (and its subsidiaries) and Asia Media financial support (which requires no repayment from Beijing Information and Asia Media) in the event, but not limited to Beijing Information and Asia Media incurring losses from their operations. 4. If PRC law requires Beijing Information or Asia Media to be dissolved or liquidated, Beijing Information and Asia Media shall sell all of their assets to the Company or other qualifying entity designated by the Company, at the lowest selling price permitted by applicable PRC law, any proceeds received from the transfer shall be refund to the Company to repay the loan promptly. 5. After mandatory liquidation described in Section 4 above, the shareholders of Beijing Information and Asia Media will remit in full to the Company any residual interest they receive in a nonreciprocal transfer. If such transfer is prohibited by PRC law, the shareholders of Beijing Information and Asia Media will remit the consideration to the Company or its designees in a manner permitted under applicable law. 6. Any material changes to the Prior Agreements shall require the preapproval of the Company. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Letter Agreement and the Prior Agreements, the terms of this Letter Agreement shall prevail.
