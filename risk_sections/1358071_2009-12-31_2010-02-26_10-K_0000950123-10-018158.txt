Item 1A. Risk Factors. 35 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, since 2008, proved undeveloped reserves converted to proved developed reserves during the respective year and the net investment required to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during the year: Proved Undeveloped Reserves Converted to Proved Developed Reserves Natural Investment in Conversion Oil Gas Total of Proved Undeveloped Reserves Year Ended December 31, (MBbls) (MMcf) (MBoe) to Proved Developed Reserves (In thousands) 2008(a) 4,378 15,681 6,992 $ 114,067 2009 7,453 19,860 10,763 131,773 Total 11,831 35,541 17,755 $ 245,840 (a) Our initial disclosures of our reserves occurred in our initial public offering in August 2007. At December 31, 2009, we had 107.8 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves. As a result of our adoption on December 31, 2009 of the new SEC rules related to disclosure of oil and natural gas reserves, we added approximately 13.6 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves. The majority of the additional reserves are within our two core operating areas, the Yeso and Wolfberry. The addition is primarily attributable to booking downspacing locations in the Yeso and Wolfberry where there was a high degree of confidence based on employed technologies that have demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. Historically, our drilling programs were substantially funded from our cash flow and were weighted towards drilling unproven locations. Our expectation in the future is to continue to fund our drilling programs primarily from our cash flows. Based on our current expectations of our cash flows and drilling programs, which includes drilling of proved undeveloped and unproven locations, we believe that we can fund from our cash flow and, if needed, our credit facility, the drilling of our current inventory of proved undeveloped locations in the next 5 years. Changes to proved reserves. The following table sets forth the changes in our proved reserve volumes by region during the year ended December 31, 2009 (in MBoe): Purchases of Sales of Revisions of Extensions and Minerals-in- Minerals-in- Previous Production Discoveries Place Place Estimates Core Operating Areas: New Mexico Permian (7,149 ) 45,166 4 (8 ) (4,463 ) Texas Permian (2,962 ) 17,218 20,261 (63 ) 3,324 Emerging Plays: Lower Abo (577 ) 1,068   90 Bakken/Three Forks (187 ) 2,437   186 Other (56 ) 53   (114 ) Total (10,931 ) 65,942 20,265 (71 ) (977 ) Production. Production volumes of 10.9 MMBoe includes a full year of production from our acquisition of the Henry Properties. Production does not include volumes from the Wolfberry Acquisitions closed in December 2009. Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries are primarily the result of (i) extension drilling in the Yeso of Southeast New Mexico and the Wolfberry in West Texas and exploratory drilling in certain of our emerging plays and (ii) adding 13.6 MMBoe of additional proved undeveloped locations as a result of our adoption of the new SEC rules related to disclosure of oil and natural gas reserves. The majority of the additional reserves are within our two main core operating areas, the Yeso and Wolfberry. The addition is primarily attributable to booking downspacing locations in the Yeso and Wolfberry where there was a high degree of confidence based on employed technologies that have demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. 36 Table of Contents Purchases of minerals-in-place. Purchases of minerals-in-place are primarily attributable to the Wolfberry Acquisitions closed in December 2009. Sales of minerals-in-place. We had no significant sales of minerals-in-place during 2009. Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions of previous estimates are comprised of 2.4 MMBoe of positive revisions resulting from an increase in oil price, offset by a decrease in natural gas price and 3.4 MMBoe of negative revision resulting from technical and performance evaluations. The Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2009 were determined using the twelve month average equivalent prices of $57.65 per Bbl of oil for West Texas Intermediate and $3.87 per MMBtu of natural gas for Henry Hub spot (as required by the new SEC rules related to disclosure of oil and natural gas reserves), compared to using year-end NYMEX equivalent prices of $41.00 per Bbl of oil and $5.71 per MMBtu of natural gas at December 31, 2008.

We have impaired a significant portion of the costs associated with these plays. 37 Table of Contents Title to Our Properties As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a more thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect defects affecting those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any such defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured known material title defects on such property. We have reviewed the title to substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas properties, we perform title reviews on the most significant properties and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review or update previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens to secure borrowings under our credit facility, liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect our carrying value of the properties. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are party to the legal proceedings that are described in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We are also party to other proceedings and claims incidental to our business. While many of these other matters involve inherent uncertainty, we believe that the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to such other proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position as a whole or on our liquidity, capital resources or future results of operations. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Shareholders We did not submit any matters to a vote of stockholders during the fourth quarter of 2009. 38 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information Our common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol CXO. The following table shows, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices for our common stock, as reported on the NYSE. Price Per Share High Low 2008: First Quarter $ 26.44 $ 17.33 Second Quarter $ 40.97 $ 25.12 Third Quarter $ 39.07 $ 22.31 Fourth Quarter $ 27.79 $ 14.71 2009: First Quarter $ 28.10 $ 17.29 Second Quarter $ 33.57 $ 23.50 Third Quarter $ 38.70 $ 25.17 Fourth Quarter $ 47.00 $ 33.71 On February 24, 2010, the last sales price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange was $45.48 per share. As of February 24, 2010, there were 317 holders of record of our common stock. Dividend Policy We have not paid, and do not intend to pay in the foreseeable future, cash dividends on our common stock. Covenants contained in our credit facility and the indenture governing our 8.625% senior notes due 2017 restrict the payment of dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Repurchase of Equity Securities Neither we nor any affiliated purchaser repurchased any of our equity securities during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. 39 Table of Contents Item 6. Selected Financial Data This section presents our selected historical consolidated financial data. The selected historical consolidated financial data presented below is not intended to replace our historical consolidated financial statements. You should read the following data along with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes, each of which is included in this report. Selected Historical Financial Information The following table shows our selected historical financial data for 2005 through 2009 and combined financial data of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us by Chase Oil, Caza Energy LLC and other related working interest owners (which we refer to collectively as the Chase Group Properties) for 2005. We have accounted for the combination transaction that occurred on February 27, 2006, as an acquisition by Concho Equity Holdings Corp. of the Chase Group Properties and a simultaneous reorganization such that Concho Equity Holdings Corp. became our wholly owned subsidiary. Our historical results of operations for the periods presented below may not be comparable either from period to period or going forward, for the following reasons:  On February 27, 2006, the initial closing of the Chase Oil transaction occurred, and we acquired the Chase Group Properties for approximately 35 million shares of common stock and approximately $409 million in cash;  In August 2007, we completed our initial public offering of common stock from which we received proceeds of $173 million that we used to retire outstanding borrowings under our second lien term loan facility totaling $86.5 million, and to retire outstanding borrowings under our credit facility totaling $86.5 million;  In July 2008, we closed our acquisition of the Henry Entities and additional non-operated interests in oil and natural gas properties from persons affiliated with the Henry Entities. In August 2008 and September 2008, we acquired additional non-operated interests in oil and natural gas properties from persons affiliated with the Henry Entities. We paid approximately $583.7 million in net cash for the acquisition of the Henry Entities and the related acquisition of the along-side interests, which was funded with borrowings under our credit facility and net proceeds of approximately $242.4 million from our private placement of 8,302,894 shares of our common stock;  In September 2009, we issued $300 million of 8.625% senior notes at a discount, resulting in a yield-to-maturity of 8.875 percent. Currently, the interest rate associated with the senior notes is higher than our credit facility, which will result in us having higher absolute interest rates in the foreseeable future; and  In December 2009, we closed the Wolfberry Acquisitions for approximately $260 million in cash, subject to usual and customary post-closing adjustments. The Wolfberry Acquisitions were primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, these acquisitions included estimated total proved reserves of 19.9 MMBoe, of which 69 percent were oil and 25 percent were proved developed. Our 2009 results of operations do not include any production, revenues or costs from the Wolfberry Acquisitions. 40 Table of Contents The historical financial data below for the Chase Group Properties for 2005 is derived from the audited financial statements of the Chase Group Properties.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. Statements in our discussion may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause future production, revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Overview We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development and exploration of producing oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We have also acquired significant acreage positions in and are actively involved in drilling or participating in drilling in emerging plays located in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and the Williston Basin in North Dakota, where we are applying horizontal drilling, advanced fracture stimulation and enhanced recovery technologies. Crude oil comprised 67 percent of our 211.5 MMBoe of estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2009, and 67 percent of our 10.9 MMBoe of production for 2009. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 95.3 percent of our proved developed producing PV-10 and 66.4 percent of our 3,960 gross wells at December 31, 2009. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used. Commodity Prices Our results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil and natural gas, include:  developments generally impacting the Middle East, including Iraq and Iran;  the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil supply through export quotas;  the overall global demand for oil; and  overall North American natural gas supply and demand fundamentals, including:  the impact of the decline of the United States economy,  weather conditions, and  liquefied natural gas deliveries to the United States. Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2009. Oil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. In general, oil and natural gas prices were substantially lower during the comparable periods of 2009 measured against 2008. 43 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, as well as the high and low NYMEX price for the same periods: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Average NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl) $ 61.95 $ 99.75 $ 72.45 Natural gas (MMBtu) $ 4.16 $ 8.89 $ 7.11 High / Low NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl): High $ 81.37 $ 145.29 $ 98.18 Low $ 33.98 $ 33.87 $ 50.48 Natural gas (MMBtu): High $ 6.07 $ 13.58 $ 8.64 Low $ 2.51 $ 5.29 $ 5.38 Further, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $83.18 and $71.19 per Bbl and $6.01 and $4.78 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2010 to February 24, 2010. At February 24, 2010, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $80.00 per Bbl and $4.82 per MMBtu, respectively. Recent Events Equity issuance. On February 1, 2010, we issued 5,347,500 shares of our common stock at $42.75 per share. After deducting underwriting discounts of approximately $9.1 million and estimated transaction costs, we received net proceeds of approximately $219.2 million. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. Wolfberry acquisitions. In December 2009, we closed the Wolfberry Acquisitions for approximately $260 million in cash, subject to usual and customary post-closing adjustments. The Wolfberry Acquisitions were primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, these acquisitions included estimated total proved reserves of 19.9 MMBoe, of which 69 percent were oil and 25 percent were proved developed. Our 2009 results of operations do not include any production, revenues or costs from the Wolfberry Acquisitions. Senior notes issuance. On September 18, 2009, we issued $300 million in principal amount of 8.625% senior notes due 2017 at 98.578 percent of par. The 8.625% senior notes will mature on October 1, 2017 and interest is paid in arrears semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 beginning April 1, 2010. We used the net proceeds of $288.2 million (net of related offering costs) to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. The senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of ours and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. Borrowing base. Pursuant to the terms of our credit facility, our borrowing base was to be reduced by $0.30 for every dollar of new indebtedness evidenced by unsecured senior notes or unsecured senior subordinated notes that we issue. As a result of this provision, the borrowing base under our credit facility would have been reduced by $90 million due to our issuance and sale of the senior notes. However, we received waivers of this provision from lenders representing approximately 95.4 percent of our borrowing base, resulting in an actual reduction of approximately $4.1 million in our borrowing base, which reduced our borrowing base to $955.9 million. On October 23, 2009, our borrowing base of $955.9 million was reaffirmed by our lenders under our credit facility. At December 31, 2009, we had $405.9 million of availability under our credit facility. Assuming the proceeds of $219.2 million from our February 2010 equity offering had been received on December 31, 2009 and were applied to reduce borrowings under our credit facility, our availability under our credit facility would have been $625 million. 44 Table of Contents 2010 capital budget. In December 2009, we announced our 2010 capital budget of approximately $625 million. We expect to be able to fund our 2010 capital budget substantially within our cash flow. However, our capital budget is largely discretionary, and if we experience sustained oil and natural gas prices significantly below the current levels or substantial increases in our drilling and completion costs, we may reduce our capital spending program to remain substantially within our cash flow. The following is a summary of our 2010 capital budget: 2010 Budget (In millions) Drilling and recompletion opportunities in our core operating area $ 502 Projects operated by third parties 8 Emerging plays, acquisition of leasehold acreage and other property interests, and geological and geophysical 82 Facilities capital in our core operating areas 33 Total 2010 capital budget $ 625 Henry Entities Acquisition On July 31, 2008, we closed the acquisition of Henry Petroleum LP and certain entities affiliated with Henry Petroleum LP (the Henry Entities) and additional non-operated interests in oil and natural gas properties from persons affiliated with the Henry Entities. In August 2008 and September 2008, we acquired additional non-operated interests in oil and natural gas properties from persons affiliated with the Henry Entities. The assets acquired in the Henry Entities acquisition, including the additional non-operated interests, are referred to as the Henry Properties. We paid $583.7 million in cash for the Henry Properties acquisition, which was funded with borrowings under our credit facility and net proceeds of approximately $242.4 million from our private placement of 8,302,894 shares of our common stock. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net liability of $66.8 million. All of our counterparties to these financial derivatives are party to our credit facility and have their outstanding debt commitments and derivative exposures collateralized pursuant to our credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of our financial derivative instruments and their collateralization under our credit facility, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls on our financial derivative instruments. We currently have no reason to believe that our counterparties to these commodity derivative contracts are not financially viable. Our credit facility does not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. New commodity derivative contracts. During 2009, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our estimated future production. The following table summarizes information about these additional commodity derivative contracts for the year ended December 31, 2009. When aggregating multiple contracts, the weighted average contract price is disclosed.

See the table that reflects the amounts of cash payments/receipts from commodity derivatives not designated as hedges that were included in computing average prices with derivatives and reconciles to the amount in gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges as reported in the statements of operations in Item 1. Business  Our Production, Prices and Expenses. 47 Table of Contents The following table presents selected financial and operating information for the fields which represent greater than 15 percent of our total proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 West Grayburg Grayburg Grayburg Wolfberry(a) Jackson Jackson Jackson Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 1,320 1,429 1,045 706 Natural gas (MMcf) 3,361 4,108 3,407 2,792 Total (MBoe) 1,880 2,114 1,613 1,171 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 58.30 $ 58.87 $ 94.35 $ 68.85 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 6.03 $ 5.76 $ 10.67 $ 8.75 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 51.72 $ 51.00 $ 83.68 $ 62.36 Production costs per Boe: Lease operating expenses including workovers $ 4.86 $ 4.47 $ 4.55 $ 3.48 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 3.77 $ 4.42 $ 7.20 $ 5.43 (a) This field was acquired as part of the acquisition of the Henry Properties on July 31, 2008. 48 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $544.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $10.6 million (2 percent) from $533.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was due to increased production (i) as a result of the inclusion of a full year of production from the Henry Properties in 2009 and (ii) due to successful drilling efforts during 2008 and 2009, partially offset by substantial decreases in realized oil and natural gas prices. Specifically, the:  average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $57.98 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of 37 percent from $91.92 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2008;  total oil production was 7,336 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 2,750 MBbl (60 percent) from 4,586 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2008;  average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $5.52 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of 42 percent from $9.59 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2008; and  total natural gas production was 21,568 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 6,600 MMcf (44 percent) from 14,968 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2008. Hedging activities. We utilize commodity derivative instruments in order to (i) reduce the effect of the volatility of price changes on the commodities we produce and sell, (ii) support our capital budget and expenditure plans and (iii) support the economics associated with acquisitions. Currently, we do not designate our derivative instruments to qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, we reflect the changes in the fair value and settlements of our derivative instruments in the statements of operations as (gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. All of our remaining hedges that historically qualified or were dedesignated from hedge accounting were settled in 2008. For further discussion and information see (Gain) loss on derivative instruments not designated as hedges below and Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The following is a summary of the effects of commodity hedges that qualified for hedge accounting treatment for the year ended December 31, 2008: Oil Hedges Natural Gas Hedges Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2008 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Decrease in oil and natural gas revenues $ (30,591 ) $ (696 ) Hedged volumes (Bbls and MMBtus, respectively) 951,000 4,941,000 Production expenses. The following table provides the components of our total oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) Lease operating expenses $ 62,647 $ 5.73 $ 43,725 $ 6.17 Taxes: Ad valorem 5,493 0.50 2,738 0.39 Production 39,017 3.57 43,775 6.18 Workover costs 961 0.09 996 0.14 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 108,118 $ 9.89 $ 91,234 $ 12.88 49 Table of Contents Among the cost components of production expenses, in general, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Lease operating expenses were $62.6 million ($5.73 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $18.9 million (43 percent) from $43.7 million ($6.17 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2008. The total increase in absolute amounts in lease operating expenses was due to (i) the inclusion of a full year of expenses from the wells acquired in the Henry Properties acquisition and (ii) our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2008 and 2009. The decrease in lease operating expenses on a per unit basis is due to (i) increased volumes from our successful drilling program in 2008 and 2009 that has allowed economies of scale in our cost structure and (ii) cost reductions in services and supplies, primarily as a result of the recently lower commodity prices, offset by the wells acquired in the Henry Properties acquisition, which have a higher per unit cost as compared to our historical per unit cost. Ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Henry Properties, which were highly concentrated in Texas, a state which has a higher ad valorem tax rate than New Mexico, where substantially all of our properties prior to the Henry Properties acquisition were located. Production taxes per unit of production were $3.57 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of 42 percent from $6.18 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was directly related to the decrease in commodity prices offset by the increase in oil and natural gas revenues related to increased volumes. Over the same period, our Boe prices (before the effects of derivatives) decreased 38 percent. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (In thousands) Geological and geophysical $ 3,663 $ 3,140 Exploratory dry holes 1,941 3,722 Leasehold abandonments and other 5,056 31,606 Total exploration and abandonments $ 10,660 $ 38,468 Our geological and geophysical expense during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily attributable to continued seismic activity in our Lower Abo emerging play. During the year ended December 31, 2008, our geological and geophysical expense was primarily attributable to a comprehensive seismic survey on our New Mexico shelf properties which was initiated in December 2007 and completed in 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we wrote-off an unsuccessful exploratory well in our Arkansas emerging play and two unsuccessful exploratory wells in Texas Permian area. Our exploratory dry hole expense during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily attributable to an unsuccessful operated exploratory well located in our Texas Permian area. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded approximately $5.1 million of leasehold abandonments, which relate primarily to the write-off of four prospects in our New Mexico Permian area and three prospects in our Texas Permian area. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $31.6 million of leasehold abandonments, which were primarily related to two prospects in our Texas and Arkansas emerging plays area. 50 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 201,908 $ 18.47 $ 121,464 $ 17.15 Depreciation of other property and equipment 2,680 0.25 1,808 0.26 Amortization of intangible asset  operating rights 1,555 0.14 640 0.09 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 206,143 $ 18.86 $ 123,912 $ 17.50 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 57.65 $ 41.00 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 3.87 $ 5.71 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $201.9 million ($18.47 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $80.4 million from $121.5 million ($17.15 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in depletion expense, on an absolute basis, was primarily due to (i) a full year effect of acquisition of the Henry Properties, (ii) capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2008 and 2009 and (iii) to a lesser extent the Wolfberry Acquisition in December 2009. The increase in the per Boe depletion expense was primarily due to (i) the Henry Properties acquisition, for which the depletion rate was higher than that of our historical assets and (ii) capitalized costs associated with the drilling of proved undeveloped locations which generally do not add any incremental proved reserves, offset by the increase in the oil prices between the years utilized to determine proved reserves. On December 31, 2009, we adopted the new SEC rules related to disclosures of oil and natural gas reserves. As a result of these new SEC rules we recorded an addition 13.6 MMBoe of proved reserves. We utilized the additional proved reserves in our depletion computation in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter of 2009 depletion expense rate was $16.74 per Boe, which is lower than past quarters in part due to the these additional proved reserves. In the future, making comparisons to prior periods as it relates to our depletion rate may be difficult as a result of these new SEC rules. The amortization of the intangible asset is a result of the value assigned to the operating rights that we acquired in the Henry Properties acquisition. The intangible asset is currently being amortized over an estimated life of approximately 25 years. Impairment of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Due primarily to downward adjustments to the economically recoverable proved reserves associated with declines in commodity prices and well performance, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, which was primarily attributable to natural gas related properties in our New Mexico Permian area. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $18.4 million, which was comprised primarily of fields in our emerging plays in Texas and North Dakota. 51 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) General and administrative expenses  recurring $ 44,477 $ 4.06 $ 36,170 $ 5.11 Non-recurring bonus paid to Henry Entities employees, see Note K 10,150 0.93 4,328 0.61 Non-cash stock-based compensation  stock options 4,285 0.39 3,101 0.44 Non-cash stock-based compensation  restricted stock 4,755 0.44 2,122 0.30 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements (11,390 ) (1.04 ) (4,945 ) (0.70 ) Total general and administrative expenses $ 52,277 $ 4.78 $ 40,776 $ 5.76 General and administrative expenses were $52.3 million ($4.78 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $11.5 million (28 percent) from $40.8 million ($5.76 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008 was primarily due to (i) a full year effect of the non-recurring bonus paid to former Henry Entities employees, (ii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation and (iii) an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses, partially offset by an increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements. In connection with the Henry Entities acquisition, we agreed to pay certain of our employees, who were formerly Henry Entities employees, a predetermined bonus amount, in addition to the compensation we pay these employees, over the two years following the acquisition. Since these employees will earn this bonus over the two years, we are reflecting the cost in our general and administrative costs as non-recurring, as it is not controlled by us. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information related to this bonus. We earn reimbursements as operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own interests. As such, we earned reimbursements of $11.4 million and $4.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The increase in this reimbursement is primarily related to the Henry Properties acquisition, as we own a lower working interest in these operated properties compared to our historical property base, so we receive a larger third-party reimbursement as compared to our historical property base and 2009 reflects a full year effect of owning the Henry Properties. Bad debt expense. On May 20, 2008, we entered into a short-term purchase agreement with an oil purchaser to buy a portion of our oil affected as a result of a New Mexico refinery shut down due to repairs. On July 22, 2008, this purchaser declared bankruptcy. We fully reserved the receivable amount due from this purchaser of approximately $2.9 million as of December 31, 2008, and pursued a claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. In December 2009, we recovered approximately $1.0 million and accordingly reduced our allowance for bad debts and bad debt expense. (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. In 2007, we discontinued designating our derivative instruments to qualify for hedge accounting; see Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information related to our derivative instruments. Accordingly, we reflect changes in the fair value and settlements of our derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations. 52 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the cash settlements and the non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for the derivative contracts not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (In thousands) Cash payments (receipts): Commodity derivatives  oil $ (74,796 ) $ 7,780 Commodity derivatives  natural gas (10,955 ) (1,426 ) Financial derivatives  interest 3,335  Mark-to-market (gain) loss: Commodity derivatives  oil 229,897 (253,960 ) Commodity derivatives  natural gas 7,958 (3,347 ) Financial derivatives  interest 1,418 1,083 (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges $ 156,857 $ (249,870 ) Interest expense. Interest expense was $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $0.7 million from $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The weighted average interest rate for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 3.4 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively. The weighted average debt balance during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $668.0 million and $450.7 million, respectively. In September 2009, we issued $300 million of 8.625% senior notes at a discount, resulting in a yield-to-maturity of 8.875 percent. Currently, the interest rate associated with the senior notes is higher than the credit facility, which will result in us having higher absolute interest rates in the foreseeable future. The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2009 was due primarily to borrowings in July 2008 for the acquisition of the Henry Properties. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the weighted average debt balance. The decrease in the weighted average interest rate is primarily due to an improvement in market interest rates, offset by the effect of our senior notes. Income tax provisions. We recorded an income tax benefit of $20.7 million and income tax expense of $162.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 67.9 percent and 36.8 percent, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $6.6 million and $5.7 million associated with a reduction in our estimated overall state tax rate and the related effect on our net deferred tax liability. In 2008, we acquired the Henry Properties and in 2009 we made the Wolfberry Acquisitions, the assets of which were primarily in the state of Texas. The state income tax rate is lower in Texas compared to New Mexico (the location of our other significant concentration of assets). Accordingly, this has caused a reduction of our overall estimated state income tax rate due to the addition of Texas assets. Also, in 2009, we recorded a benefit of approximately $1.6 million associated with revisions to our 2008 tax provision. Excluding the effect of these two items our effective income tax rate would have been 41.3 percent and 38.1 percent in 2009 and 2008, respectively, which would approximate a more normalized effective income tax rate. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $533.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $239.5 million (81 percent) from $294.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to (i) the acquisition of the Henry Entities on July 31, 2008, 53 Table of Contents (ii) increased production due to successful drilling efforts during 2008 and (iii) substantial increases in realized oil and natural gas prices. In addition:  average realized oil prices (excluding the effects of derivative activities) were $91.92 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 34 percent from $68.58 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2007;  total oil production was 4,586 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 1,572 MBbl (52 percent) from 3,014 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2007;  average realized natural gas prices (excluding the effects of derivative activities) were $9.59 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 19 percent from $8.08 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2007;  total natural gas production was 14,968 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 2,904 MMcf (24 percent) from 12,064 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2007; Hedging activities. We utilize commodity derivative instruments in order to (i) reduce the effect of the volatility of price changes on the commodities we produce and sell, (ii) support our capital budget and expenditure plans and (iii) support the economics associated with acquisitions. In 2007, we prospectively discontinued designating our derivative instruments to qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, we began reflecting the changes in the fair value and settlements of our derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations as (gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. All of our remaining hedges that historically qualified or were dedesignated from hedge accounting were settled in 2008. For further discussion and information see (Gain) loss on derivative instruments not designated as hedges below and Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The following is a summary of the effects of commodity hedges that qualified for hedge accounting treatment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Oil Hedges Natural Gas Hedges Years Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Increase (decrease) in oil and natural gas revenues $ (30,591 ) $ (11,091 ) $ (696 ) $ 1,291 Hedged volumes (Bbls and MMBtus, respectively) 951,000 1,076,750 4,941,000 6,482,600 Oil and natural gas production costs. The following table provides the components of our oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) Lease operating expenses $ 43,725 $ 6.17 $ 26,480 $ 5.27 Taxes: Ad valorem 2,738 0.39 2,012 0.40 Production 43,775 6.18 24,301 4.84 Workover costs 996 0.14 1,474 0.29 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 91,234 $ 12.88 $ 54,267 $ 10.80 54 Table of Contents Among the cost components of production expenses, in general, we have control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Lease operating expenses were $43.7 million ($6.17 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $17.2 million (65 percent) from $26.5 million ($5.27 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in lease operating expenses was due to (i) the wells acquired in the Henry Properties acquisition, which increased the absolute and per unit amount because those wells have a higher per unit cost as compared to our historical per unit cost, (ii) our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2008 and (iii) general inflation of field service and supply costs associated with rising commodity prices. Ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of (i) the acquisition of the Henry Properties, which were highly concentrated in Texas, a state which has a higher ad valorem tax rate than New Mexico, where substantially all of our properties prior to the Henry Properties acquisition were located and (ii) an increase in commodity prices. Production taxes per unit of production were $6.18 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 28 percent from $4.84 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was directly related to the increase in oil and natural gas revenues and the related increase in commodity prices. Over the same period our Boe prices (before the effects of derivatives) increased 32 percent. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Geological and geophysical $ 3,140 $ 4,089 Exploratory dry holes 3,722 21,923 Leasehold abandonments and other 31,606 3,086 Total exploration and abandonments $ 38,468 $ 29,098 Our geological and geophysical expense, which primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis, during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.1 million, a decrease of $1.0 million from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to a comprehensive seismic survey on our New Mexico shelf properties which was initiated in December 2007 and completed in 2008. Our exploratory dry hole expense during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily attributable to an unsuccessful operated exploratory well located in our Texas Permian area. Our exploratory dry hole expense during the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily attributable to three wells drilled in our Texas emerging plays area and two wells which were drilled in our New Mexico Permian area. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $31.6 million of leasehold abandonments, which were primarily related to two prospects in our Texas and Arkansas emerging plays area. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $3.1 million of leasehold abandonments, which were primarily related to a prospect in our Texas Permian area, a prospect in our New Mexico Permian area and leasehold expiring in our New Mexico Permian area. 55 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 121,464 $ 17.15 $ 75,744 $ 15.07 Depreciation of other property and equipment 1,808 0.26 1,035 0.21 Amortization of intangible asset  operating rights 640 0.09   Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 123,912 $ 17.50 $ 76,779 $ 15.28 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 41.00 $ 92.50 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 5.71 $ 6.80 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $121.5 million ($17.15 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $45.8 million from $75.7 million ($15.07 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to (i) the Henry Properties acquisition for which the depletion rate was higher than that of our historical assets, (ii) capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2007 and 2008 and (iii) the decrease in the oil and natural gas prices between the years which were utilized to determine the proved reserves. The amortization of the intangible asset is a result of the value assigned to the operating rights that we acquired in the Henry Properties acquisition. The intangible asset is currently being amortized over an estimated life of approximately 25 years. Impairment of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Due primarily to downward adjustments to the economically recoverable proved reserves associated with declines in commodity prices and well performance, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $18.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, which was comprised primarily of a property in our New Mexico Permian area. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $7.3 million, which was comprised primarily of properties in our Texas Permian and Texas emerging plays areas. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) General and administrative expenses  recurring $ 36,170 $ 5.11 $ 22,419 $ 4.47 Non-recurring bonus paid to Henry Entities employees, see Note K 4,328 0.61   Non-cash stock-based compensation  stock options 3,101 0.44 2,463 0.49 Non-cash stock-based compensation  restricted stock 2,122 0.30 1,378 0.27 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements (4,945 ) (0.70 ) (1,083 ) (0.22 ) Total general and administrative expenses $ 40,776 $ 5.76 $ 25,177 $ 5.01 General and administrative expenses were $40.8 million ($5.76 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $15.6 million (62 percent) from $25.2 million ($5.01 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2008 over 2007 was primarily due to (i) the non-recurring bonus paid to Henry Entities employees, (ii) an increase in non-cash stock- 56 Table of Contents based compensation and (iii) an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses, partially offset by an increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements. In connection with the Henry Entities acquisition, we agreed to pay certain of our employees, who were formerly Henry Entities employees, a predetermined bonus amount, in addition to the compensation we pay these employees, over the two years following the acquisition. Since these employees will earn this bonus over the two years, we are reflecting the cost in our general and administrative costs as non-recurring, as it is not controlled by us. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information related to this bonus. We earn reimbursements as operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own interests. As such, we earned reimbursements of $4.9 million and $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The increase in this reimbursement is directly related to the Henry Properties acquisition, as we own a lower working interest in these operated properties compared to our historical property base, so we have a larger third-party reimbursement as compared to our historical property base. Bad debt expense. On May 20, 2008, we entered into a short-term purchase agreement with an oil purchaser to sell a portion of our oil production affected by a New Mexico refinery shut down due to repairs. On July 22, 2008, this purchaser declared bankruptcy. We fully reserved the receivable amount of $2.9 million due from this purchaser for June and July production during the year ended December 31, 2008. Contract drilling fees  stacked rigs. We determined in January 2007 to reduce our drilling activities for the first three months of 2007. As a result, we recorded an expense during the year ended December 31, 2007 of approximately $4.3 million for contract drilling fees related to stacked rigs subject to daywork drilling contracts with two drilling contractors. We resumed the majority of our planned drilling activities in April 2007 and all planned drilling activities in June 2007. These costs were minimized during the first six months of 2007 as one contractor secured work for a rig for 71 days during that period and charged us only the difference between the then-current operating day rate pursuant to the contract and the lower operating day rate received from the new customer. Gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges. During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, we determined that all of our natural gas commodity derivative contracts no longer qualified as hedges. Because we no longer considered these hedges to be highly effective, we discontinued hedge accounting for those existing hedges, prospectively, and during the period the hedges became ineffective. In addition, for our commodity and interest rate derivative contracts entered into after August 2007, we chose not to designate any of these contracts as hedges. As a result, any changes in fair value and any cash settlements related to these contracts are recorded in earnings during the related period. The following table sets forth the settlements and the non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for the derivative contracts not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Cash payments (receipts): Commodity derivatives  oil $ 7,780 $  Commodity derivatives  natural gas (1,426 ) (1,815 ) Financial derivatives  interest   Mark-to-market (gain) loss: Commodity derivatives  oil (253,960 ) 22,988 Commodity derivatives  natural gas (3,347 ) (899 ) Financial derivatives  interest 1,083  (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges $ (249,870 ) $ 20,274 57 Table of Contents Interest expense. Interest expense was $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $7.0 million from $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The weighted average interest rate for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 5.1 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively. The weighted average debt balance during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $450.7 million and $436.3 million, respectively. The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to the Henry Properties acquisition in July 2008, offset by (i) the partial prepayment in August 2007 of $86.6 million on the 2nd lien credit facility and the repayment in August 2007 of $86.6 million on our previous revolving credit facility and (ii) a partial prepayment in March 2008 on our previous revolving credit facility utilizing cash from operations. Also, in July 2008, we repaid and terminated our 2nd lien credit facility which resulted in the write-off of approximately $1.1 million of deferred loan costs and approximately $0.4 million of original issue discount, both of which are included in interest expense. In March 2007, we reduced our previous revolving credit facilitys borrowing base by $100.0 million, or 21 percent, resulting in the write-off of $0.8 million of deferred loan costs, and repaid a term credit facility, resulting in the write-off of $0.4 million of deferred loan costs, both of which are included in interest expense. In August 2007, we made a $86.6 million partial prepayment on our 2nd lien credit facility from proceeds of our initial public offering, which resulted in the write-off of approximately $1.0 million of deferred loan costs and approximately $0.4 million of original issue discount, both of which are included in interest expense. The decrease in the weighted average interest rate is due to (i) improvement in market interest rates and (ii) the fact that the interest rate margins under our credit facility (and previous revolving credit facility) were lower than those under our 2nd lien credit facility. Income tax provision. We recorded an income tax expense of $162.1 million and $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 36.8 percent and 38.7 percent, respectively. We estimated a higher effective state income rate in 2007 than in 2008, which is primarily due to our estimate of income among the various states in which we own assets. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in Capital resources below. Oil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $394.0 million, $339.6 million and $180.2 million, respectively. These expenditures were primarily funded by cash flow from operations (including effects of derivative cash receipts/payments). In December 2009, we announced our 2010 capital budget of approximately $625 million. We expect to be able to fund our 2010 capital budget substantially within our cash flow. However, our capital budget is largely discretionary, and if we experience sustained oil and natural gas prices significantly below the current levels or substantial increases in our drilling and completion costs, we may reduce our capital spending program to remain substantially within our cash flow. Other than the purchase of leasehold acreage and other miscellaneous property interests, our 2010 capital budget is exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise. Although we cannot provide any assurance, we believe that our available cash and cash flows will substantially fund our 2010 capital expenditures, as adjusted from time to time; however, we may also use our credit facility or other alternative financing sources to fund such expenditures. The actual amount and timing of our expenditures 58 Table of Contents may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, actual drilling results, the timing of expenditures by third parties on projects that we do not operate, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, regulatory, technological and competitive developments and market conditions. In addition, under certain circumstances we would consider increasing or reallocating our 2010 capital budget. Acquisitions. Our expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $280.5 million, $838.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively. The Wolfberry Acquisitions in December 2009 were funded by borrowings under our credit facility, and the Henry Properties acquisition in July 2008 was primarily funded by a private placement of our common stock and borrowings under our credit facility. Contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, cash interest expense on debt, operating lease obligations, drilling commitments, employment agreements with executive officers, contractual bonus payments, derivative liabilities and other obligations. We had the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In thousands) Long-term debt(a) $ 850,000 $  $  $ 550,000 $ 300,000 Cash interest expense on debt(b) 265,769 51,330 82,550 60,733 71,156 Operating lease obligations(c) 10,012 2,291 3,033 2,386 2,302 Drilling commitments(d) 1,781 1,781    Employment agreements with executive officers(e) 3,930 1,965 1,965   Henry Entities bonus obligation(f) 5,763 5,763    Derivative liabilities(g) 91,756 62,419 29,337   Asset retirement obligations(h) 22,754 3,262 704 620 18,168 Total contractual obligations $ 1,251,765 $ 128,811 $ 117,589 $ 613,739 $ 391,626 (a) See Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding future interest payment obligations on the 8.625% unsecured senior notes. The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. (b) Cash interest expense on the 8.625% unsecured senior notes is estimated assuming no principal repayment until the due date of October 1, 2017. Cash interest expense on the credit facility is estimated assuming (i) a principal balance outstanding equal to the balance at December 31, 2009 of $550 million with no principal repayment until the instrument due date of July 31, 2013 and (ii) a fixed interest rate of 2.8 percent, which was our interest rate at December 31, 2009. Also included in the Less than 1 year column is accrued interest at December 31, 2009, for both the Senior Notes and credit facility of approximately $10.1 million. (c) See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (d) Consists of daywork drilling contracts related to drilling rigs contracted through June 30, 2010. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (e) Represents amounts of cash compensation we are obligated to pay to our executive officers under employment agreements assuming such employees continue to serve the entire term of their employment agreement and their cash compensation is not adjusted. (f) Represents bonuses we agreed to pay certain former employees of the Henry Entities at each of the first and second anniversaries of the closing of the Henry Properties acquisition. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 59 Table of Contents (g) Derivative obligations represent commodity and interest rate derivatives that were valued at December 31, 2009. The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our derivative obligations. (h) Amounts represent costs related to expected oil and natural gas property abandonments related to proved reserves by period, net of any future accretion. See Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Off-balance sheet arrangements. Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Capital resources. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operating activities (including the derivative cash receipts/payments presented in our investing activities) and financing provided by our credit facility. We believe that funds from our cash flows should be sufficient to meet both our short-term working capital requirements and our 2010 capital expenditure plans. If our cash is not sufficient we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility to fund our cash flow deficits. Cash flow from operating activities. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $359.5 million, $391.4 million and $169.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008 was principally due to increases in oil and natural gas production costs and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased oil and natural gas revenues. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2008 over 2007 was principally due to (i) increases in our oil and natural gas production as a result of our exploration and development program, (ii) five months of activity from the acquired Henry Properties and (iii) increases in average realized oil and natural gas prices. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we invested $669.3 million, $931.9 million and $162.6 million, respectively, for additions to, and acquisitions of, oil and natural gas properties, inclusive of dry hole costs. Cash flows used in investing activities were substantially lower during the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008, due to (i) the Henry Properties acquisition in 2008 being larger than the Wolfberry Acquisitions in 2009 and (ii) our receipts from, in 2009, compared to our payments on, in 2008, associated with derivatives not designated as hedges, offset by increased exploration and development activities in 2009. Cash flows used in investing activities were substantially higher during the year ended December 31, 2008 over 2007, primarily due to the Henry Properties acquisition, as well as increased drilling activity in 2008. Cash flow from financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $212.1 million, $542.0 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we net borrowed $215.7 million of debt, which was used primarily to fund the Wolfberry Acquisitions in December 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we net borrowed $302.1 million of debt and issued approximately 8.3 million shares of our common stock to fund the Henry Properties acquisition. In March 2007, we entered into a $200 million 2nd lien credit facility. The proceeds were principally used to repay the outstanding balance under our prior term loan facility and to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility. On September 18, 2009, we issued $300 million in principal amount of 8.625% senior notes due 2017 at 98.578 percent of par. The 8.625% senior notes will mature on October 1, 2017 and interest is paid in arrears semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 beginning April 1, 2010. We used the net proceeds of $288.2 million (net of related estimated offering costs) to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. The senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of ours and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. We issued the senior notes to (i) extend the maturities of our debt to better match the long-lived nature of our assets, (ii) increase liquidity under our credit facility and (iii) reduce our dependency on bank debt. Pursuant to the terms of our credit facility (described below), our borrowing base was to be reduced by $0.30 for every dollar of new indebtedness evidenced by unsecured senior notes or unsecured senior subordinated notes 60 Table of Contents that we issue. As a result of this provision, the borrowing base under our credit facility would have been reduced by $90 million due to our issuance and sale of the senior notes. However, we received waivers of this provision from lenders representing approximately 95.4 percent of our borrowing base, resulting in an actual reduction of approximately $4.1 million in our borrowing base, which reduced our borrowing base to $955.9 million. Our credit facility, as amended, has a maturity date of July 31, 2013. At December 31, 2009, we had letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility of approximately $25,000 and our availability to borrow additional funds was approximately $405.9 million. In October 2009, the lenders reaffirmed our $955.9 million borrowing base under the credit facility until the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination in April 2010. Between scheduled borrowing base redeterminations, we and, if requested by 662/3 percent of the lenders, the lenders, may each request one special redetermination. Advances on the credit facility bear interest, at our option, based on (i) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPM Prime Rate) (3.25 percent at December 31, 2009) or (ii) a Eurodollar rate (substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate). At December 31, 2009, the interest rates of Eurodollar rate advances and JPM Prime Rate advances vary, with interest margins ranging from 200 to 300 basis points and 112.5 to 212.5 basis points, respectively, per annum depending on the debt balance outstanding. At December 31, 2009, we pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the available borrowing base of 50 basis points per annum. In June 2008, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with certain unaffiliated third-party investors to sell certain shares of our common stock in a private placement (the Private Placement) contemporaneous with the closing of the Acquisition. On July 31, 2008, we issued 8,302,894 shares of our common stock at $30.11 per share pursuant to the Private Placement. We paid the placement agent of the Private Placement a fee of approximately $7.6 million, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $242.4 million. In conducting our business, we may utilize various financing sources, including the issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock, (iv) common stock and (v) other securities. We may also sell assets and issue securities in exchange for oil and natural gas assets or interests in oil and natural gas companies. Additional securities may be of a class senior to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined from time to time by our board of directors. Utilization of some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our credit facility. On February 1, 2010, we issued 5,347,500 shares of our common stock at $42.75 per share. After deducting underwriting discounts of approximately $9.1 million and estimated transaction costs we received net proceeds of approximately $219.2 million. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay a portion of the borrowing under our credit facility. Assuming the proceeds from this offering were received on December 31, 2009 and were applied to reduce our borrowings under our credit facility, our availability under our credit facility would have been approximately $625 million. Financial markets. The current state of the financial markets remains uncertain; however, we have recently seen improvements in the stock market and the credit markets appear to have stabilized. There have been financial institutions that have (i) failed and been forced into government receivership, (ii) received government bail-outs, (iii) declared bankruptcy, (iv) been forced to seek additional capital and liquidity to maintain viability or (v) merged. The United States and world economy has experienced and continues to experience volatility, which continues to impact the financial markets. At December 31, 2009, we had $405.9 million of available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. Our credit facility is backed by a syndicate of 21 banks. Even in light of the volatility in the financial markets, we believe that the lenders under our credit facility have the ability to fund additional borrowings we may need for our business. We pay floating rate interest under our credit facility and we are unable to predict, especially in light of the uncertainty in the financial markets, whether we will incur increased interest costs due to rising interest rates. We have used interest rate derivatives to mitigate the cost of rising interest rates, and we may enter into additional interest rate derivatives in the future. Additionally, we may issue additional fixed rate debt in the future to increase available borrowing capacity under our credit facility or to reduce our exposure to the volatility of interest rates. 61 Table of Contents In the current financial markets, there is no assurance that we could refinance our credit facility with comparable terms, particularly the five-year term of our credit facility. Because our credit facility matures in July 2013, we do not expect to seek refinancing of our credit facility until 2011. To the extent we need additional funds beyond those available under our credit facility to operate our business or make acquisitions we would have to pursue other financing sources. These sources could include issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock, (iv) common stock or (v) other securities. We may also sell assets. However, in light of the current financial market conditions there are no assurances that we could obtain additional funding, or if available, at what cost and terms. Liquidity. Our principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At December 31, 2009, we had $3.2 million of cash on hand. At December 31, 2009, the borrowing base under our credit facility was $955.9 million (which was reaffirmed in October 2009), which provided us with $405.9 million of available borrowing capacity. Assuming the proceeds from our February 2010 equity offering were received on December 31, 2009 and were applied to reduce our borrowings under our credit facility, our availability under our credit facility would have been approximately $625 million. Our borrowing base is redetermined semi-annually, with the next redetermination occurring in April 2010. Between scheduled borrowing base redeterminations, we and, if requested by 662/3 percent of the lenders, the lenders, may each request one special redetermination. In general, redeterminations are based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserve levels. Upon a redetermination, our borrowing base could be substantially reduced. In light of the current commodity prices and the state of the financial markets, there is no assurance that our borrowing base will not be reduced. Book capitalization and current ratio. Our book capitalization at December 31, 2009 was $2,181.2 million, consisting of debt of $845.8 million and stockholders equity of $1,335.4 million. Our debt to book capitalization was 39 percent and 32 percent at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.64 to 1.00 at December 31, 2009 as compared to 1.03 to 1.00 at December 31, 2008, which is primarily attributable to the changes in fair value of our derivative instruments. Inflation and changes in prices. Our revenues, the value of our assets, and our ability to obtain bank financing or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in commodity prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Commodity prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received an average of $57.98 per barrel of oil and $5.52 per Mcf of natural gas before consideration of commodity derivative contracts compared to $91.92 per barrel of oil and $9.59 per Mcf of natural gas in the year ended December 31, 2008. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and continued through the first six months of 2008, commodity prices for oil and natural gas increased significantly. The higher prices led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on capital costs. We expect these costs to continue to moderate during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the recent rapid diminution in prices for oil and natural gas from 2008 peaks. Critical Accounting Policies and Practices Our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. In managements opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by managements judgments and estimates are revenue recognition, the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets and valuation of stock-based 62 Table of Contents compensation. Managements judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates, as additional information becomes known. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities under this method. Exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, lease rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment, undeveloped leases and developmental dry holes are also capitalized. This accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found proved reserves. Generally, a gain or loss is recognized when producing properties are sold. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managements judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes. Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time, and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires managements judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn our leasehold positions. Non-producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves. Individually significant non-producing properties are periodically assessed for impairment of value. Depletion of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method on an individual property or unit basis based on total estimated net proved developed oil and natural gas reserves. Depletion of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using our total estimated net proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers. Service properties, equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 1 to 50 years. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and depletion are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Standardized Measure of Discounted Net Future Cash Flows This report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2009, which have been prepared and presented under new SEC rules. These new rules are effective for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009, and require SEC reporting companies to prepare their reserves estimates using revised reserve definitions and revised pricing based on a 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing. The previous rules required that reserve estimates be calculated using last-day-of-the-year pricing. The pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of December 31, 2009 was based on an unweighted average twelve month West Texas Intermediate posted price of $57.65 per Bbl for oil and a Henry Hub spot natural gas price of $3.87 per MMBtu for natural gas. As a result of this change in pricing methodology, direct comparisons to our previously-reported reserves amounts may be more difficult. Another impact of the new SEC rules is a general requirement that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. This new rule has limited and may continue to limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program, particularly as we develop our significant acreage in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill on those reserves with the required five-year time-frame. 63 Table of Contents The SEC has not reviewed our or any reporting companys reserve estimates under the new rules and has released only limited interpretive guidance regarding reporting of reserve estimates under the new rules and may not issue further interpretive guidance on the new rules. Accordingly, while the estimates of our proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2009 included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the new SEC rules, those estimates could differ materially from any estimates we might prepare applying more specific SEC interpretive guidance. Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future net cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly alter future depletion and result in impairment of long-lived assets that may be material. Asset Retirement Obligations There are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The primary impact of this on us relates to oil and natural gas wells on which we have a legal obligation to plug and abandon. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and, generally, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The determination of the fair value of the liability requires us to make numerous judgments and estimates, including judgments and estimates related to future costs to plug and abandon wells, future inflation rates and estimated lives of the related assets. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than its future net cash flows, including cash flows from risk adjusted proved reserves. The evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas, future costs to produce these products, estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions to estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell. Estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation Under the modified prospective accounting approach, we are required to expense all options and other stock-based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. The calculation of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary for using the various valuation methods utilized by us. We utilize (i) the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and (ii) the stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification or ASC) which has become the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. All existing accounting 64 Table of Contents standard documents are superseded by the Codification and any accounting literature not included in the Codification will not be authoritative. However, rules and interpretive releases of the SEC issued under the authority of federal securities laws will continue to be the source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles for SEC registrants. Effective September 30, 2009, there are no more references made to the superseded FASB standards in our consolidated financial statements. The Codification does not change or alter existing GAAP and, therefore, did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued a revision to the existing business combinations guidance. The guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. It also establishes disclosure requirements that enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The revised standard was effective for acquisitions occurring in an entitys fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2009, and account for all our business combinations using this standard and disclose all required information. Fair value. In August 2009, the FASB issued an update to the Fair Value Topic of the Codification. The FASB issued the update because some entities have expressed concern that there may be a lack of observable market information to measure the fair value of a liability. The topic is effective for the first reporting period beginning after August 28, 2009, with earlier application permitted. The guidance provides clarification on measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an active market is not available. In such circumstances, the topic specifies that a valuation technique should be applied that uses either the quote of the liability when traded as an asset, the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets, or another valuation technique consistent with existing fair value measurement guidance. Examples of the alternative valuation methods include using a present value technique or a market approach, which is based on the amount at the measurement date that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability. The guidance also states that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustments to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. We adopted the topic effective September 30, 2009, and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Oil and natural gas. In September 2009, the FASB issued an update to the Oil and Gas Topic, which makes a technical correction related to an SEC Observer comment, regarding the accounting and disclosures for natural gas balancing arrangements. The topic amends prior guidance because the SEC staff has not taken a position on whether the entitlements method or sales method is preferable for natural gas-balancing arrangements that do not meet the definition of a derivative. With the entitlements method, sales revenue is recognized to the extent of each well partners proportionate share of natural gas sold regardless of which partner sold the natural gas. Under the sales method, sales revenue is recognized for all natural gas sold by a partner even if the partners ownership is less than 100 percent of the natural gas sold. The Oil and Gas Topic update included an instruction that public companies must account for all significant natural gas imbalances consistently using one accounting method. Both the method and any significant amount of imbalances in units and value should be disclosed in regulatory filings. We currently account for all natural gas balances under the sales method and make all required disclosures. Reserve estimation. In January 2010, the FASB issued an update to the Oil and Gas Topic, which aligns the oil and natural gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SECs final rule, Modernization of the Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements (the Final Rule). The Final Rule was issued on December 31, 2008. The Final Rule is intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and natural gas reserves, which should help investors evaluate the relative value of oil and natural gas companies. The Final Rule permits the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves estimates if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volume estimates. The Final Rule will also allow, but not require, companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to 65 Table of Contents investors in documents filed with the SEC. In addition, the new disclosure requirements require companies to: (i) report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor; (ii) file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conduct a reserves audit; and (iii) report oil and natural gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior 12-month period rather than a year-end price. The Final Rule became effective for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. We adopted the ruling effective December 31, 2009, which had the effect of adding 13.6 MMBoe of proved reserves. Our fourth quarter 2009 depletion and impairment calculations were based upon proved reserves that were determined using the new reserve rules, whereas depletion and impairment calculations in previous quarters within 2009 were based on the prior SEC methodology.
