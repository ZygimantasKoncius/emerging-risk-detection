ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. (N.E.T.) founded in 1983, develops and sells voice and data telecommunications equipment for multi-service networks requiring high degrees of versatility, interoperability, security and performance. N.E.T. offers an array of products purpose-built for mixed-service, multi-protocol networks; bandwidth-sensitive site communications; high performance, security-sensitive transmissions; and converged communications. N.E.T. delivers solutions that enable seamless integration and migration of existing networks to secure internet protocol (IP)-based voice and data communications. Our Promina product line, which is now purchased mostly by government customers, has continued to provide the majority of our revenue in recent years. We expect revenue from Promina products to decline as customers continue to move from narrowband, circuit-switched networking to IP-based communications. We believe, however, that we have growth opportunities in our new products that allow entities to migrate existing networks to IP, while ensuring interoperability and continuing to provide high levels of security and reliability. N.E.T.s new product lines include the VX Series and NX Series. The VX Series offers enterprise customers a voice-over-IP (VoIP) solution that interoperates with existing private branch exchange (PBX) and IP-PBX systems, and offers government customers an IP-based secure voice solution with high bandwidth efficiency and call performance. Our NX Series is comprised of two new platforms: the NX1000, which is our next-generation multi-service wide area networking (WAN) switch in a compact form factor, and the NX5010 high-speed switch, providing data transfer at rates of ten gigabits per second (10Gbps). The NX5010 enables high-speed, secure interconnection and extension of geographically distributed grid computing clusters and storage area networks (SANs). We have a worldwide customer base that includes both governmental entities and enterprise customers in North America, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. Our government customers include a variety of federal and international agencies and organizations, including civilian and defense agencies and resellers to such entities. We target enterprise customers in a variety of sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, transportation, and retail. Our global support and service organization, along with third-party service organizations, provides installation and other professional services, a variety of maintenance programs, technical assistance, and customer training. Industry Background Telecommunications networks have evolved rapidly over the past few decades. The 1980s saw a shift away from public networks and application-specific networks to integrated private networks. These early WANs were constructed around fully-dedicated circuits to achieve high reliability along with cost savings. During the early 1990s, with the increasing availability of high-bandwidth switched digital services such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and frame relay, demand grew for enterprise network platforms to manage switched services in conjunction with enterprise networks. In response to expanding requirements for equipment to support multiple technologies, application types, and services on a single communications platform, multiservice platforms were developed. To take advantage of the increased bandwidth enabled by high-capacity connections such as optical fiber, new technologies were developed including Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and IP. Rapid expansion in use of the internet for commercial and consumer purposes, and the growth of data services as an increasing portion of telecommunications traffic, resulted in tremendous demand for broadband solutions using cell or packet switching as contrasted with narrowband circuit-switched approaches. Packet-switched networks have historically been built mainly for carrying non real-time data, and circuit-switched networks continue to offer certain advantages for networks requiring the most secure and reliably deterministic communications. Although demand has been declining for a number of years, there is still currently a small market for circuit-switched products, particularly in environments with low bandwidth requirements. With the advent of VoIP technologies, traditionally separate voice and data environments have begun to converge. VoIP allows for the transmission of voice along with other data over packet-routed networks, and provides an alternative to traditional circuit-switched telephone networks. As a result of the potential cost savings and added features of VoIP, consumers, enterprises, telecommunication service providers and others are increasingly adopting VoIP for their voice communications. This growth has been aided by technological advances that have recently improved the quality and reliability of VoIP connections to rival that of traditional telephone circuit service, including security features, and by innovations that allow VoIP connections to include services not available on traditional voice-only networks. VoIP transmissions, by virtue of the data flow over open packet-routed networks, are inherently not secure unless encryption or other security enhancements a re applied to the transmission. The increasing use of VoIP transmissions over different types of networks, such as fixed-line, cellular, and short-distance wireless, creates an opportunity to use a single protocol for these transmissions, allowing for a convergence of fixed and mobile communications. As an example of this fixed-mobile convergence (FMC), enterprises can enable subscribers to roam and handover calls between cellular networks and public and private wireless networks using dual-mode mobile handsets. With the proliferation of communications equipment and devices such as Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs), mobile phones, and desktop-PC clients, along with a multitude of communications tools such as e-mail, voicemail, calendaring, internet messaging (IM), and video conferencing, enterprises are facing significant challenges to enable their workforces to efficiently manage their communications. To address this complexity, Microsoft has announced its Unified Communications (UC) strategy, wh ich is aimed at integrating these various forms of communication. Microsoft has integrated its market-share leading Exchange Server product into its next-generation UC products. As the U.S. Federal Government moves to an all-IP network, there will be new applications, such as field-deployable VoIP gateways, secure data transmission in high performance networks, and grid computing applications. For example, many government agencies must incorporate advanced, high speed data services into their networks while providing interoperability with the broad base of network technologies and applications that have been deployed over the years. Many new applications, such as those involving grid computing, will require high-grade data transfer between SANs and WANs. InfiniBand is a communications technology for high performance networks that can interconnect large compute clusters due to its progressive scalability and extremely low latency. Until now, InfiniBand has been confined within the data center due to its sub-20 meter cable length limitations. New, very high-speed network processing chips make it possible to remove this limitatio n, so that remotely located data centers and grid computing elements can be interconnected seamlessly with InfiniBand. Business Strategy Our strategy is to provide customers with intelligent, multi-service network and voice exchange platforms for the secure, high-speed transport of voice, video, and data traffic that are designed to: · Facilitate network evolution and interoperability · Support a broad array of access technologies · Reduce risks associated with introducing new network technologies into users operations · Extend the viability of legacy systems. The following are key elements of our strategy: Leverage our incumbent position in the government market. N.E.T. was a pioneer of the concept of multi-service networking and has been delivering these mission-critical capabilities for more than twenty years. The installed base and revenue contribution from our narrowband Promina product line, sold primarily to government entities in recent years, are declining, but Promina continues to generate the majority of our revenue today. We intend to leverage our installed customer base, particularly the government, for future sales of our new broadband and IP telephony platforms, enabling the transition to IP while supporting legacy traffic and applications. Design and develop industry leading voice and data telecommunications equipment. We consider technological and product leadership to be critical to our future success. We have broad experience with mixed-service and multi-protocol networks, enabling us to develop solutions for a wide range of applications. We have extensively refined the features and technologies of our more mature products over their long product lifetimes. We strive to leverage this technological background to develop new products and additional functionality for existing products to meet our customers escalating requirements, specifically for IP conversion and secure voice applications. Leverage relationships with key partners. In addition to direct sales to enterprise customers, we continually seek to establish relationships with resellers, distributors, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and other vendors. We enter agreements with technology suppliers to supplement our internal development efforts. We also seek relationships with systems integrators, software solutions providers, and large incumbent vendors globally that can facilitate our entry and success in global enterprise networks and major government projects. Align with Microsoft-driven unified communications strategy. Microsoft has been a customer of N.E.T.s for several years. This relationship has enabled us to align our product development and resources to support Microsofts unified communications strategy and, as a result, we are well positioned to partner with other Microsoft solution providers. Through strategic alliances with these well-respected systems integrators and resellers, we are establishing channels for N.E.T.s products into the enterprise market. Provide value-added service and system integration capabilities. Since our inception, we have viewed customer service and support as a key element of our overall strategy and a critical component for our long-term relationship with customers. Customers around the world turn to us not only for the reliability and performance of our products but also for our comprehensive support services that optimize the value of those products. Additionally, by offering an upgrade path to new products in lieu of costly time and materials options for long-discontinued products, we are able to reintroduce ourselves to customers who recognize our tradition for building high performance, reliable and well-supported products. Products Promina  Narrowband Multiservice Access Our Promina family of multi-service access platforms integrates voice, data, image and video traffic across a single network infrastructure. The Promina platform, tailored to circuit-switched networks, provides mission-critical support for a wide variety of communications applications and traffic types, including ATM, frame relay, IP, and ISDN signaling. Promina products offer a broad range of user-side interfaces, enabling standards-based connection of communications equipment, whether located at a service providers switching facility or at an enterprise or government customers premises. The Promina platform features advanced network management services, which provide a high degree of visibility into network operations. For fault tolerance and high network reliability, our Promina products can be configured with redundant power, common logic, and trunk interfaces. These products incorporate distributed network intelligence that allows the network to quickly and automatically reroute traffic in the event of failure of a component. The Promina product family includes a range of systems for various node sizes, with various processor, application, and interface modules. We offer a broadband aggregation for Promina customers with the Promina Broadband Shelf, providing government customers with a broad range of ATM and IP technology. Our Promina networks are monitored and controlled by netMS, an integrated network management solution. In addition, we also market an IP trunk interface for Promina, enabling direct IP connections to the Promina platform. In fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, our Promina products, including the Promina Broadband Shelf, accounted for 76.0%, 86.8%, and 90.4% of product revenue, respectively. VX Series  Voice Exchange The VX Series voice exchange platform enables integrated, secure VoIP communications with enhanced mobility and advanced voice compression technology. The next evolution of our SHOUT product line, the VX Series is a fully-integrated multi-service voice switch, which can be deployed in distributed networks to reduce and consolidate PBX infrastructure. The VX Series extends advanced call system features from centralized data centers to remote locations. With its remote survivability features, the VX Series provides continuous, local call service and intelligent trunk routing in the event of network connectivity failures. It can also be integrated into existing mission critical networks or deployed as the primary solution in green field applications. The VX Series supports a variety of voice capabilities for government and enterprise customers. The systems advanced protocol translation, along with industry standard interfaces, provides exceptional compatibility or interoperability with existing vendors and networks. To address needs of the U.S. Federal Government, the VX Series provides an IP-based secure voice solution with high bandwidth efficiency and call performance. A high bandwidth utilization rate is particularly important in expensive, limited bandwidth situations such as satellite links. The VX Series also enables the use of secure telephone unit (STU) phones on IP networks. N.E.T.'s VX switches provide end-to-end, tactical-to-fixed site connectivity. Key features that enable high-quality secure voice calls include data compression, forward error correction, echo cancellation and jitter correction  all critical factors when operating in tactical, high-latency or unpredictable network environments. For tactical deployment, the VX Series is available in form factors small enough to fit into a backpack. The VX Series design is closely aligned with Microsofts UC strategy. The VX Series enables unified communications on legacy PBXs and provides support for unified messaging. Leveraging our VoIP deployment at Microsoft and integration with other Microsoft products, N.E.T. is providing new applications for this platform, including robust remote survivability features and fixed mobile convergence (FMC) utilizing voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Our VX Series consists of the VX2500, VX900, VX900T, VX400, and the VX1200, which was under development at March 30, 2007. The VX2500 platform supports one to 32 T1/E1 connections or up to 960 simultaneous voice calls, all in a five-inch high chassis that can be easily configured for a variety of services. This platform reduces space requirements by eliminating multiple stand-alone devices and complex integration efforts. The smaller VX900 supports one to eight T1/E1 connections or 240 simultaneous voice calls, with support for STU phones. The VX900 chassis is one rack unit (1RU) high and the ruggedized VX900T is approximately half the size. The VX400 is the first deployment of our VX Series on DTECH LABS second generation mobile VoIP hardware platform. Targeted at the tactical government, military and first-responder markets, the VX400 offers the functionality already available in our VX900, but is designed to support 1-4 tactical secure call users, plus da ta, over an IP-based satellite network infrastructure. The VX1200, which began shipping in the first quarter of 2008, contains features at a cost point intended to satisfy the requirements of the enterprise UC market. In fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, our VX Series and predecessor products accounted for 20.0%, 8.0%, and 3.8% of product revenue, respectively. NX Series  Network Exchange The NX Series network exchange products are high-performance networking platforms that provide high-grade data transfer between SANs and WANs and secure grid computing. The NX5000 Series, our high speed network exchange platform: Responding to increasing demand for secure, high speed, multi-service networking and LAN/SAN virtualization, N.E.T. partnered with Bay MicroSystems to develop an agile, high-speed exchange platform. This new platform, the NX5000 Series, has speeds of 10Gbps and is scaleable up to 160Gbps. The first product in our NX5000 Series, the NX5010 platform, is a next-generation, high speed multi-service aggregation and switching platform for mission-critical communications. This platform enables customers with geographically distributed computing and storage resources to connect as if they were co-located within the same LAN or data center and makes it possible to collapse into a single integrated system the multiple switches currently required to perform SAN to WAN communications. The NX5010 significantly improves our customers ability to transfer large amounts of data throughout disparate networks on a single switch. Initially targeted at government and financial c ustomers, the NX5010 also addresses our customers increasing need for secure, high speed, versatile networking. It is scalable and compact, with a very small foot print only two rack units (2RU) high. The NX5010 has been tested in field trials that utilized InfiniBand, IP, Ethernet, ATM, and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) protocols. In fiscal 2007, the first year the NX Series products were made commercially available, sales accounted for less than 10% of total revenue. The NX1000 Series, our IP-Enable Multi-Service Platform: The recently released NX1000, an extension of our Promina product line, provides a flexible, cost-effective Internet Protocol (IP) aggregation solution that facilitates migration of legacy traffic to IP. It is fully interoperable with the existing Promina product line, delivering an all-new architecture and built-in capability to converge legacy applications onto an IP-based network while also providing four times the bandwidth of similarly sized Promina models. The NX1000 adds multi-service aggregation capabilities to the NX Series product line-up and is housed in a rugged, compact and lightweight chassis and fits well into tactical and first-responder applications as well as supporting applications for high speed serial or legacy migration to IP, IP-based satellite transport, and tactical to fixed-site connectivity. The NX1000 also offers higher speed data interfaces, diskless data storage, and an optional rubidium atomic clock module to provide a high lev el of accuracy and synchronization for bit synchronous applications over IP. Customers and Markets N.E.T. operates in one segment: the design, development, manufacture and sale of networking technology platforms used for mission-critical communications solutions and associated services used by government organizations, enterprises, and carriers worldwide. N.E.T. pioneered multi-service networking and has been delivering this capability for over 20 years. Our focus is on information and communication-intensive organizations and these customers may be local, national, or global in their operations. We identify our markets as two primary groups: government and enterprises. Government customers include but are not limited to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, civilian agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and international organizations such as NATO and foreign defense ministries, as well as resellers to such entities. We target enterprise customers in a variety of sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, transportation, and retail. In recent fiscal years, commercial sales of our Promina-based solutions have mostly been in emerging markets, such as Eastern Europe, China, and Latin America. Sales to the government sector represented 91.1%, 86.1%, and 86.6% of N.E.T.s revenue in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. N.E.T. does business with the government both as a direct contractor and as a subcontractor. A substantial portion of the revenue generated from our government customers is based on our contract with the General Services Administration (GSA), as well as through direct contracts such as with the Department of Defense (DoD) and NATO. Some of these contracts may also be used by other government agencies. N.E.T.s current GSA contract has been extended through June 27, 2007 while it is up for renewal for a multi-year period, pending agreement on new pricing and other terms. In fiscal 2007, EDO Corporation and General Dynamics (both government systems integrators) accounted for 21.6% and 13.2% of our revenue, respectively. In fiscal 2006, NATO accounted for 10.7% of our revenue, and in fiscal 2005, NATO and General Dynamics accounted for 13.5% and 11.0%, respectively, of our revenue. Excluding aggregate orders from a variety of government agencies, no other single customer accounted for more than ten percent of N.E.T.s revenue in fiscal 2007, 2006, or 2005. Our commercial revenue from international customers accounted for 6.8%, 9.3%, and 8.5% of total revenue for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Going forward, we believe our revenue growth in the enterprise markets will largely be driven by the acceptance of Microsofts UC initiative. As an incumbent supplier into Microsofts internal voice network, we are working closely with Microsoft and its key partners as they introduce new enterprise-focused unified communications and unified messaging products, of which our VX platform is a key enabler. To date, this revenue has not been significant, as we are currently in the process of initial product trials. Competition The market for telecommunications equipment is highly competitive and dynamic, has been characterized by rapid changes to and the convergence of technologies, and has seen a worldwide migration from existing circuit technology to packet-based IP technologies. We compete directly, both internationally and domestically, with many different companies, some of which are large established suppliers of end-to-end solutions such as Alcatel-Lucent, Avaya, Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, Nortel Networks, and Siemens AG. In addition to some of these large suppliers, a number of other smaller companies are targeting the same markets as we do. Particularly, in the unified communications market, Audiocodes Limited and Dialogic Corporation provide competitive solutions and are also partners with Microsoft. We believe our long operating history and strong balance sheet give us some of the advantages of larger businesses, while our small size and relatively narrow focus give us some of the advantages of smaller companies. Our larger competitors, however, have greater financial, marketing and technical resources than we do and offer a wider range of networking products than we offer and can often provide customers a complete network solution. They often can compete favorably on price because their sales volume and broad product lines can allow them to make discounted sales while maintaining acceptable overall profit margins. Conversely, our smaller competitors may have more ability than we do to focus their resources on a particular product development unencumbered by the requirements to support an existing product line, allowing greater flexibility in their market strategies. Sales We sell our products and services through both direct and indirect sales channels worldwide, including large government systems integrators. We support the sales force effort with systems engineers who provide customers with pre-sale and post-sale technical assistance which allows N.E.T. to gain more in-depth knowledge of customers network requirements. Our business is generally not seasonal, though we have been affected by delays in adoption of government entity budgets and spending patterns of the Federal Government at its September fiscal year end. We intend to make greater use of distributors and integrators in some markets, especially for the VX Series product line. Our international sales are made almost entirely through indirect channels that are augmented by the efforts of a local sales force. In addition to the marketing and sale of products, international resellers provide system installation and technical support. In most cases, international resellers have non-exclusive agreements to resell N.E.T. products within particular geographic areas. Resale agreements do not contain a sales commitment or required sales quota. We sell to the U.S. Federal Government primarily through N.E.T.s wholly owned subsidiary, N.E.T. Federal, Inc. (N.E.T. Federal), which sells products directly, through systems integrators, through collaborative government contracting, and by contracting agencies at their convenience or at annual intervals. N.E.T. Federal supports sales to the Federal Governments defense, intelligence, and civilian sectors and to international government organizations. Our selling model makes use of our field sales, engineering, product management, and executive personnel to establish and maintain customer contacts at multiple levels within a customer organization. We believe the successful execution of this multi-tiered selling model is important to our success. Backlog We manufacture our products based upon our forecast of customer demand and we typically build products in advance of receiving firm orders from our customers. Orders for N.E.T.s products are generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis and we typically have been able to ship these products within 30-90 days after the customer submits a firm purchase order. As a U.S.-based company, we are required to give priority to Federal Government rated defense-expedite (DX) orders, which may cause the backlog of other customers orders to become delinquent. Because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders, N.E.T.s backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of sales in any future period. Customer Service The markets, customers and complex challenges of the networking industry described above require support, service and other assistance in the development, operation and expansion of a customer network. We provide a wide range of global service and support options to customers and resellers of N.E.T. products. Service offerings include product installation and other professional services, a choice of different hardware and software maintenance programs designed to meet the varying needs of our customers, parts repair, remote and on-site technical assistance, and customer training. In addition, N.E.T. provides web-based customer support services through our Electronic Support Center. Services available over the web include first-line troubleshooting information for N.E.T. products; technical information, such as trouble shooting guides and frequently asked questions; and a web-based interface to N.E.T.s Technical Assistance Center (TAC) through an online case management system. TAC, which is staffed by engineers trained in networking products, is set up to assist customers remotely over the telephone. TAC engineers have the ability to replicate customer problems and test proposed solutions prior to implementation. Maintenance support from TAC, whether provided over the web or over the telephone, is fee-based under either an annual fee contract or on a time-and-materials basis. Through a contractual arrangement with CACI International Inc. (CACI), CACI has certain rights to provide maintenance and other services to our Federal customers. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, our relationship with CACI was revised and expanded. Under the new arrangement, both companies will sell services for N.E.T. products, and each company will be responsible for various aspects of service delivery. Revenue from maintenance and training services will be shared between both companies, with the percentage to be determined based upon revenue levels. Our products are also serviced and supported by authorized entities around the globe. Customer training on N.E.T. products is provided to both end-users and resellers worldwide. We provide training both at N.E.T. facilities and at customer and reseller sites. Our training services can be customized to meet the special requirements of our customers. Customers are charged per person per class for N.E.T. training. We also offer a portfolio of computer-based training sessions for our products, which are licensed on an individual or site basis. In fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, service and support revenue accounted for 13.4%, 18.7%, and 15.3%, respectively, of N.E.T.s revenue. Manufacturing Since the second half of fiscal 2006, we have outsourced all product manufacturing, including assembly and structural test. Previously, we performed the functional test, systems integration, and order fulfillment functions in-house at our Fremont, California facility. We maintain a level of control over parts procurement, design, documentation and selection of approved suppliers. We remain liable for any termination or cancellation of orders, discontinuance of product, or excess material created by an engineering change. We have not incurred significant charges as a result of these factors. Several key components of our products are available only from a single source, including certain integrated circuits and power supplies. Depending upon the component, there may or may not be alternative sources or substitutes. Some of these components are purchased through purchase orders without an underlying long-term supply contract. Any delay or difficulty in obtaining needed components could seriously impact our ability to ship products. We attempt to maintain sufficient inventory to ship products quickly, normally within 30 to 90 days after receipt of an order. Scheduling of production and inventory supply is based on internal sales forecasts. Generally, our customer contracts allow the customers to reschedule delivery dates or cancel orders within certain time frames before shipment without penalty and outside those time frames with a penalty. Because of these and other factors, there are risks that excess or inadequate inventory levels could occur. The majority of the manufacturing is currently performed by a contract-manufacturing vendor that is privately funded and has a limited history of operations. We are currently transitioning the manufacturing to a more-established vendor. Final assembly of our products will be done in the new vendors Boise, Idaho facility, and we intend to utilize the vendors rapid prototyping facility in Fremont, California. We are focused on continually enhancing the quality of products and services delivered to customers worldwide. This includes improving the quality of supplied components, subassemblies and internal processes. As part of this continuing process, N.E.T. is ISO 9001:2002 certified. Research and Development We believe that our long-term success depends on our ability to maintain product and technology leadership. The networking equipment industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, enhancements to products currently in the market and constantly changing customer requirements. To compete effectively, N.E.T. must be able to bring new products to market in a timely and cost-effective manner and provide existing customers an attractive migration path to our newer products. Along with making continued investments in our internal research and development, we also enter into development agreements with other technology suppliers and may make strategic acquisitions to obtain needed technology and resources. We continually monitor relevant markets and our customers businesses and technology developments in order to develop products that proactively address customer needs. The majority of our research and development activity is focused on packet-based technologies, particularly VoIP and high-speed networking. While most product development activity is undertaken by N.E.T. employees, we enter into license and technology agreements to accelerate development of new products or expand the scope of development efforts, as well as outsource some of our product development activities. In fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, N.E.T.s research and development expenditures were $21.4 million, $23.2 million, and $26.1 million, respectively. Employees As of March 30, 2007, we had 238 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good. Geographic Information See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Intellectual Property We believe that the development of our intellectual property portfolio is central to our success and ability to compete effectively. We devote considerable resources to invent and develop new technologies and then to protect these technologies from unauthorized use. We have a program to seek protection of our proprietary technology under various protection frameworks such as patent, trade secret, trademarks and copyright protection. We seek protection in the United States and in select foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We believe that ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights is central to our ability to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement allegations. We also seek to protect our inventions, trade secrets and other confidential information by non-disclosure policies. All of our employees and contractors sign confidentiality and invention disclosure agreements. Any person outsi de N.E.T. receiving N.E.T. confidential information either signs a non-disclosure agreement prior to receiving proprietary technology information, is a licensee of N.E.T., or is bound by a professional duty of confidentiality. Over the past twenty years, a number of patents have been issued to N.E.T. in the United States, Europe and Japan. These include some very early basic ATM inventions that conform to ATM Forum standards. We have a highly focused effort to identify and patent our proprietary VX Series technology and technology related to the migration of our narrowband Promina multiservice access platform to broadband services. In fiscal 2007, we were granted four U.S. patents, and now hold a total of 39 U.S. patents. These patents will expire between December 2007 and November 2025. We expect to continue filing patent applications and enter into license agreements as our development process for newer products moves forward. We have not historically pursued claims against other companies based on possible infringements of our patent portfolio, but we believe that our investment in intellectual property protection can offer defenses to claims against us and may provide an additional source of future revenue. For each of our product lines, we license some of our technology from third parties. Some of these licenses contain limitations on distribution of the licensed technology, are limited in duration, or provide for expiration upon certain events such as a change in control of the company. Our NX5010 product was developed in partnership with Bay Microsystems (Bay) and includes key components manufactured under license from Bay, for which we paid a license acquisition fee of $3 million and also pay a royalty on units sold. For follow-on platforms to the NX5010, we may again engage Bay, which would require payment of an additional license acquisition fee and a royalty on units sold. Where You Can Find More Information We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to such reports filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, available free of charge on or through our Internet website located at www.net.com., as soon as reasonably practical after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Stockholders may also access and download free of charge our corporate governance documents, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee Charters, and Code of Business Conduct, on or through this Internet website.

RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described below. Although we have tried to identify the material risks to our business, this is not an all-inclusive list. There may be additional risks that have not yet been identified and risks that are not material now but could become material. Any one of these risks could hurt our business, results of operations or financial condition. We have incurred net losses in the past and may continue to incur losses in the future. For each of the last several fiscal years, we have incurred net losses. Although we have reduced operating expenses over the past several years, we will need revenue to grow in order to achieve profitability. Our circuit-switched product line, Promina, currently provides the majority of our revenue, but revenue from that product line has declined in recent years. Our newer IP-based products have not yet achieved market acceptance or broad commercial sales, and we are incurring substantial product development and marketing expenses for those and other product lines. Accordingly, we will not likely be profitable unless our newer product lines achieve commercial success that outpaces the anticipated decline of our Promina product line. In addition, we must contain our operating expenses, many of which are fixed in the short term making it difficult to reduce expenses rapidly in response to shortfalls in revenue. Our operating results may continue to fluctuate. Our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter. These fluctuations may result from a number of factors, including: · changes in demand for our products, particularly our narrowband Promina product line, which has declined significantly in the last two fiscal years; · the timing of orders from, and shipments to, our customers; · the timing of the introduction of, and market acceptance for, new products and services; · variations in the mix of products and services we sell; · the timing and level of certain expenses, such as joint venture and development arrangements, marketing activities, prototype costs, write-offs of obsolete inventory, or adjustments to accounting estimates made in previous periods; · the timing of revenue recognition, which depends on numerous factors, such as contractual acceptance provisions and separability of arrangements involving multiple elements, including some factors that are out of our control, such as assurance as to collectibility; · the timing and amounts of stock-based awards to employees; · the timing and size of Federal Government budget approvals and spending, and timing of government deployment schedules; and · economic conditions in the networking industry, including the overall capital expenditures of our customers. We recorded restructure costs of $10.1 million in fiscal 2007 related to vacating our former manufacturing facility. In determining this charge, we made various assumptions regarding our ability to sublease this facility, the amount of sublease income, and expense reimbursement. In the event we are not able to sublease this property, or amounts received from a subtenant are below our estimated amounts, we will incur additional restructure costs, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Due to the foregoing factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a good indication of our future performance. Any shortfall in revenue may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Investors should not rely on our results or growth for one quarter as any indication of our future performance. Our stock price is volatile and could decline substantially. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline. Fluctuations or a decline in our stock price may occur regardless of our performance. Among the factors that could affect our stock price, in addition to our performance, are: · variations between our operating results and either the guidance we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of securities analysts; · changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business; · announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products or services, acquisitions, or other significant transactions; · sale of our common stock or other securities in the future; · the inclusion or exclusion of our stock in various indices or investment categories, especially as compared to the investment profiles of our stockholders at a given time; · changes in the stock prices of other telecommunications equipment companies, to the extent that some investors tend to buy or sell our stock based on segment trends; · the trading volume of our common stock; and · repurchases we make of our common stock. We are dependent on revenue from the Promina product line. Currently, we derive the majority of our product revenue from our Promina product line, a circuit-based narrowband technology. The market for our Promina product is declining as networks increasingly employ packet-based broadband technology. This technology migration resulted in a significant drop in sales of our Promina products over the last several years. If we are unable to develop substantial revenue from our newer packet-based broadband product lines, our business and results of operations will suffer. Although we have developed a migration path to broadband technology and have entered and expect to enter into development agreements with third parties to expand our broadband offerings, this strategy may not materially mitigate this decline. A significant portion of our revenue is generated from sales to governmental agencies. A significant portion of our total revenue from product sales comes from contracts with governmental agencies, most of which do not include long-term purchase commitments. Historically, the government has been slower to adopt new technology, such as packet-based technology, which has had the effect of extending the product life of our Promina product. While the government has purchased and is evaluating some of our new products for broader deployment, this new business may not develop quickly or be sufficient to offset future declines in sales of our Promina product. Furthermore, if the government accelerated adoption of new technology, and replaced the Promina product line in their networks with products other than ours, our product revenue would decline further. We anticipate that our past experience will result in future contracts with the government; however, we face significant competition in this endeavor. If we fail in developing new products and successful ly selling them to our government customers, our revenue may not increase to profitable levels. The Federal Government has issued specific requirements for IP networking products to incorporate a technology referred to as IPv6 and requires products destined for use in military applications be certified by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC). If we are unable to complete development efforts necessary to support IPv6 within the timeframes required by the Federal Government or are unable to obtain JITC certifications as needed, our government sales, and hence our revenue and results of operation, may suffer. A substantial portion of the revenue generated from our government customers is based on our contract with the GSA, which is presently up for renewal. In connection with the renewal, we must agree to new pricing and the government has requested additional contractual provisions, increasing the risk that we might be unable to renew our GSA contract on acceptable terms, if at all. If the GSA contract is renewed by the government, we expect some of the discounts provided to the government to be higher than those in the current contract. If the GSA contract is not renewed, many of our government sales will be more difficult and our revenue and results of operations may suffer. As part of the renewal process for our contract with the GSA, the government performed a limited post-award review of sales activity in the period 2001 to 2005. The review identified a number of possible discrepancies regarding our compliance with the GSA contract and resulted in the Company mak ing a payment to the government of $795,000, as well as implementing changes to its compliance practices. Any compliance discrepancies subsequent to the review period would result in additional liability to the GSA. Through an agreement resulting from the sale of our Federal Services Business to CACI, CACI and the Company share responsibility for maintenance and other services to our Federal Government customers. If for any reason our mutual customers are unsatisfied with the services, it could adversely affect sales of our products and services. Our success depends on our ability to develop new products and product enhancements that will achieve market acceptance. Our operating results will depend on the successful design, development, testing, introduction, marketing, and broad commercial distribution of our newer IP-based products, as well as successful evolution of our Promina product line incorporating packet-based technology. The success of these products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, competitive pricing, timely completion and introduction to the market, differentiation from competitors products, and broad market acceptance. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products. Products and technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obso lete or non-competitive, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability. Gross margins could decline over future periods. Gross margins may be adversely affected in the future due to increases in material and labor costs, increases in subcontractor charges, changes in the mix of products and services we sell, increased sales through resellers, increased warranty costs, or pressure on pricing and margins due to competition. As we introduce new products, our overall gross margins may decline, as new products typically have lower gross margins than established products, as a result of customary discounting for early customers and higher per-unit costs associated with low purchase volumes of components. A decline in our gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Regulations and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, affect our ability to sell into international markets. We conduct sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the United States and depend on non-US operations of our subsidiaries and distribution partners. As a general rule, international sales tend to have risks that are difficult to foresee and plan for, including political and economic stability, regulatory changes, currency exchange rates, changes in tax rates and structures, and collection of accounts receivable. Further, our international markets are served primarily by non-exclusive resellers who themselves may be severely affected by economic or market changes within a particular country or region. For sales within the European Union, our products must comply with the Restriction on Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) and Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) requirements, any failure of which could result in fines, product seizures, or injunctions against sale. Some of our products include features that make them subject t o U.S. export restrictions. The market for our products is highly competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do. The market for networking equipment is highly competitive and dynamic, has been characterized by rapid technological changes and shifting customer requirements, and has seen a worldwide migration from existing circuit technology to the new packet-based technologies. We compete directly, both internationally and domestically, with many different companies, some of which are large, established suppliers of end-to-end solutions, such as Alcatel-Lucent, Avaya, Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, Nortel Networks and Siemens AG. In addition to some of these large suppliers, a number of other smaller companies are targeting the same markets as we are. Particularly, in the unified communications market, Audiocodes Limited and Dialogic Corporation provide competitive solutions and are also partners with Microsoft. Our larger competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and technical resources than we have and offer a wider range of networking products than we offer and can often provide a complete network solution. They are often able to devote greater resources to the development, marketing and sale of their products and to use their equity or significant cash reserves to acquire other companies with technology and/or products that compete directly with ours. They often can compete favorably on price because their sales volume and broad product lines can allow them to make discounted sales while maintaining acceptable overall profit margins. The smaller companies have more ability than we do to focus their resources on a particular product development unencumbered by the requirements to support an existing product line. As a result of the flexibility of their market strategies, our competitors may be able to obtain strategic advantages that may adversely aff ect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the networking equipment market has seen the constant introduction of new technologies that has reduced the value of older technology solutions. This has created pricing pressure on older products while increasing the performance expectations of newer networking equipment. Moreover, broadband technology standards are constantly evolving and alternative technologies or technologies with greater capability are constantly introduced and sought by our customers. It is possible that the introduction of other technologies will either supplant our current technologies and technologies we have in development, or will require us to significantly lower our prices in order to remain competitive. To remain competitive, we must continue to evolve our product lines to meet the ever-changing technology needs of the networking market while ensuring that they can be sold at a competitive price. We also must enhance our Promina product line to provide needed features t hat increase its overall value for the customer while keeping the price competitive. Due to the competitive nature of the market and the relative age of our Promina product offerings as well as the competitive pressure affecting all our products, we may not be able to maintain prices for them at levels that will sustain profitability. Also, we may not be successful in completing the development of, or commercializing, products under development. If we are unable to sign competitive resale partners, our future product and service revenue will be adversely affected. Our international sales are made almost entirely through indirect channels that include distributors and resellers worldwide, and our business strategy includes leveraging resale partners in the United States. In addition, many of our target customers, including the government, rely on systems integrators to incorporate new equipment or services into their networks. While we have begun the process of identifying and signing software application, system integrator and OEM or resale partners, more partners are necessary in these areas for us to be successful. We may also need to pursue strategic partnerships with vendors who have broader technology or product offerings in order to compete with the end-to-end solution providers. Failure to sign up new reseller and strategic partners could affect our ability to grow overall revenue. Our distributors and resellers often also resell product lines from other companies, including our competitors, some of whom have strong market position relative to the Company. Because of existing relationships that many of our competitors have with distributors and resellers, it is often difficult for us to find a distributor or reseller who is willing and contractually able to resell our products. If we cannot develop relationships with distributors and resellers that can effectively market and sell our products and services, our future revenue will be adversely affected. Our products have long sales cycles, making it difficult to predict when a customer will place an order and when to forecast revenue from the related sale. Our products are very complex and represent a significant capital expenditure to our customers. The purchase of our products can have a significant impact on how a customer designs its network and provides services either within its own organization or to an external customer. Consequently, our customers often engage in extensive testing and evaluation of products before purchase. There are also numerous financial and budget considerations and approvals that the customer often must obtain before it will issue a purchase order. As a result, the length of our sales cycle can be quite long, extending beyond twelve months in some cases. In addition, our customers, including resellers, often have the contractual right to delay scheduled order delivery dates with minimal penalties and to cancel orders within specified time frames without penalty, which makes it difficult to predict whether or not an order may actually ship. We often must incur substantial sales and mark eting expense to ensure a purchase order is placed. If the order is not placed in the quarter forecasted, our sales may not meet forecast and revenue may be insufficient to meet expenses. Because it is difficult for us to accurately forecast sales, particularly within a given time frame, we face a risk of carrying too much or too little inventory. Typically, the majority of our revenue in each quarter has resulted from orders received and shipped in that quarter. While we do not believe that backlog is necessarily indicative of future revenue levels, our customers ordering patterns and the possible absence of backlogged orders create a significant risk that we could carry too much or too little inventory if orders do not match forecasts. Rather than base forecasts on orders received, we have been forced to schedule production and commit to certain expenses based more upon forecasts of future sales, which are difficult to predict. If large orders do not close when forecasted or if near-term demand weakens for the products we have available to ship, our operating results for that quarter or subsequent quarters would be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, if there is an unexpected decrease in demand for certain products or there is an increased risk of inventory obsolescence, which can happen rel atively quickly due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, adjustments may be required to write down or write off the inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to attract, recruit and retain key personnel, then we may not be able to successfully manage our business. Our success continues to be dependent on our being able to attract and retain highly skilled engineers, managers and other key employees. In most cases, we face significant competition for the most qualified personnel for new positions and to replace departing employees. If we are not able to continue to attract, recruit and retain key personnel, particularly in engineering and sales and marketing positions, we may be unable to meet important company objectives such as product delivery deadlines and sales targets. Our ability to ship our products in a timely manner is dependent on the availability of component parts and other factors. Several key components of our products are available only from a single source, including certain integrated circuits and power supplies. Depending upon the component, there may or may not be alternative sources or substitutes. Some components are purchased through purchase orders without an underlying long-term supply contract, and some components are in short supply generally throughout the industry. If a required component were no longer available, we might have to significantly reengineer the affected product. Further, variability in demand and cyclical shortages of capacity in the semiconductor industry have caused lead times for ordering parts to increase from time to time. Delays may occur as a result of factors beyond our control, including weather-related delays. If we encounter shortages or delays in receiving ordered components or if we are not able to accurately forecast our ordering requirements, we may be unable to ship ordered products in a timely m anner, resulting in decreased revenue. Generally, our customer contracts allow the customers to reschedule delivery dates or cancel orders within certain time frames before shipment without penalty and outside those time frames with a penalty. Because of these and other factors, there are risks of excess or inadequate inventory that could negatively affect our expenses, revenue and earnings. Additionally, defense expedite (DX)-rated orders from the Federal Government, which by law receive priority, can interrupt scheduled shipments to our other customers. We single-source our manufacturing processes and are transitioning between vendors; a failure or delay by our contract-manufacturing vendors could affect our ability to ship our products timely. We outsource all product manufacturing, including assembly and structural test, as well as functional test, systems integration, and order fulfillment functions, though we generally remain liable for inventory of components and finished material. The majority of our manufacturing is currently performed by a contract-manufacturing vendor that is privately funded and has a limited history of operations. Businesses in the contract-manufacturing industry are often thinly-capitalized and financed largely by debt, increasing the possibility of financial difficulties. In the event that our current vendor encounters a downturn in business and is unable to fund its business through ongoing operations, current financing vehicles, or additional funding, the vendor will likely be unable to fulfill our manufacturing needs. Any such failure by the current vendor could cause substantial delays in our product shipments to customers and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. We are currently transitioning our contract manufacturing to a more established vendor. We expect the transition to continue throughout calendar 2007. The transition will involve extra manufacturing costs and requires that manufacturing equipment and inventory be moved between the vendors as well as the transfer of knowledge specific to the manufacture of our products. The lack of the new vendors experience with our products and adjustments to working with the new vendor could cause delays in customer product shipments or problems with product quality. Any other difficulties or failures to perform by either contract manufacturer could also cause delays in customer product shipments or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations. We intend in the future to also transfer responsibility for inventory management and production planning to the contract manufacturer, which could increase the risks of carrying too much or too little inventory of either co mponent parts or manufactured product. We have agreed to compensate our contract manufacturers in the event of termination or cancellation of orders, discontinuance of product, or excess material created by an engineering change. Also, should the new contract manufacturer in some future period decide not to renew our contract with them, or should we experience any failure to perform or other difficulties with the contract manufacturer, it would be difficult for us to quickly transfer our manufacturing requirements to another vendor, likely causing substantial delays in customer product shipments and adversely affecting our revenue and results of operations. Our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business. Our future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. Although we attempt to establish and maintain rights in proprietary technology and products through patents, copyrights, and trade secrets laws, we cannot predict whether such protection will be adequate, or whether our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights. As competition in the communications equipment industry increases and the functionality of the products in this industry further overlap, we believe that companies in the communications equipment industry may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. We have received and may continue to receive notice from third parties, including some of our competitors, claiming that we are infringing their patents or their other proprietary rights. To settle such claims, we may enter into licensing arrangements requiring us to pay a royalty to the third party. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in any litigation over third-party claims, or that we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents on commercially reasonable terms. Any of these claims, whether with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, divert our managements time, attention and resources, delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, a third party may not be willing to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement on acceptable terms, if at all. If a claim of product infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non-infringing technology, we may be unable to market the affected product. Although we have a number of patent applications pending, we cannot guarantee that any will result in the issuance of a patent. Even if issued, the patent may later be found to be invalid or may be infringed without our knowledge. Our issued patents might not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction and it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of our proprietary technology by others. Regardless of our efforts to protect our intellectual property, the rapidly changing technologies in the networking industry make our future success primarily a function of the skill, expertise and management abilities of our employees. Nonetheless, others may assert property rights to technologies that are relevant to our currently marketed products or our products under development. If our protected proprietary rights are challenged, invalidated or circumvented, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and sales of our products. Conversely, if other parties are infringing our patents, we may pursue claims against them in order to yield value attributable to our technology. Such claims could involve costly litigation, could divert our managements time and resources, and could result in counterclaims challenging rights to other technology used by us. We rely on technologies licensed from third parties. For each of our product lines, we license some of our technology from third parties. Some of these licenses contain limitations on distribution of the licensed technology, are limited in duration, or provide for expiration upon certain events, such as a change in control of the company. If the relevant licensing agreement expires or is terminated without our being able to renew that license on commercially reasonable terms, or if we cannot obtain a license for our products or enhancements on our existing products we may be unable to market the affected products. For many of these technologies, we rely on the third-party providers to update and maintain the technology, fixing errors and adding new features. If the third-party providers do not adequately update and maintain these technologies, whether due to changes in their product direction, their own financial difficulties, or other reasons, we would need to seek alternative means to fulfill the ongoing requireme nts for our products that incorporate the third-party technology. If we are unable to find alternative means of fulfilling the ongoing requirements, we may be unable to market the affected products. For example, our NX5010 product was developed in partnership with Bay Microsystems (Bay) and includes key components manufactured under license from Bay, for which we paid a license acquisition fee of $3 million and also pay a royalty on units sold. For follow-on platforms to the NX5010, we may again engage Bay, which would require payment of an additional license acquisition fee and a royalty on units sold. We have also begun to outsource some of our product development activities, which carries inherent risks such as reduced ability to control the timing and quality of the work product, uncertain continuity and availability of skills and knowledge, difficulties of managing and integrating the third-party development, and potential disputes over intellectual property. To the extent we use parties located in overseas jurisdictions, the intellectual property provided to or developed by the third party may, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction, be subject to weaker or significantly different intellectual property protection. In using third parties for product development, we must share with them and will receive from them various intellectual property, which increases the risk of misuse of our intellectual property, as well as the risk that the resulting product might contain items that infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We face risks associated with changes in regulations and tariffs, including regulation of the Internet. Changes in domestic and international telecommunications equipment requirements could affect the sales of our products. In the United States, our products must comply with various FCC requirements and regulations. In countries outside of the United States, our products must sometimes meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities. Changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could impact our ability to market the affected product. New restrictions on trade, such as in response to transfers of jobs from the United States to lower-cost foreign locations, could limit our ability to purchase components from, or outsource functions to, foreign entities, which would likely make it more difficult to maintain competitiveness in the global market. As a result of our current concentration of business to the Federal Government, we are more sensitive to these trade restrictions, whether tariffs, incentives, or government purchasing requirements such as the Buy American Act, than we would be with a more diversified customer base. Changes in other laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation or enforcement thereof, such as confidentiality requirements under the federal privacy laws, Californias state wage and hour laws, or employment regulations in foreign jurisdictions, impose additional costs and potential liabilities on the Company. We are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse affect on our financial results. We use foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant accounts receivable and intercompany account balances denominated in foreign currencies. Although we have established foreign exchange contracts for non-dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in the United Kingdom, France, and Japan, exposures remain for non-dollar denominated operating expenses in Asia and Latin America. We will continue to monitor our exposure and may hedge against these or any other emerging market currencies as necessary. Market value gains and losses on hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged. The location of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquake and floods. Our corporate headquarters, including most of our research and development operations, are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. These facilities are located near the San Francisco Bay where the water table is quite close to the surface and where tenants have experienced water intrusion problems in the facilities nearby. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake or flood, could have a material adverse affect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We may engage in acquisitions or similar transactions that could disrupt our operations, cause us to incur substantial expenses, result in dilution to our stockholders, and harm our business if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business, products, technologies or personnel. Although historically we have focused on internal product development and growth, we may pursue acquisition prospects that would complement our existing business or enhance our technological capabilities. An acquisition may result in dilution to the holdings of our stockholders through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other securities as consideration in a transaction. Such dilution could also occur through the sale of common stock or other securities to raise cash for use as consideration in a transaction. Market perception of a transaction could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Any acquisition by us could result in large and immediate write-offs, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to amortizable intangible assets, any of which could negatively affect our results of operations. Furthermore, acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including difficult ies in the assimilation of products, operations, personnel and technologies; diversion of managements attention from other business concerns; disruptions to our operations; risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and potential loss of key employees. Any material weakness or significant deficiency identified in our internal controls could have an adverse effect on our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their internal control structure and procedures over financial reporting. In addition, our independent accountants must report annually on management's evaluation as well as evaluate our internal control structure and procedures. Due to the ongoing evaluation and testing of our internal controls, there could be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in the future. In addition, the evaluation process and any required remediation, if applicable, may increase our accounting, legal and other costs, and may divert management resources from other business objectives and concerns. Further, we intend to replace our enterprise resource planning software, which is part of our control environment, and which we use to process sales, prepare our financial reports, and perform other critical business processes, during fiscal 2008. Any failure to implement the new system in a timely and fully functional manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and stock price. ITEM 1B.
