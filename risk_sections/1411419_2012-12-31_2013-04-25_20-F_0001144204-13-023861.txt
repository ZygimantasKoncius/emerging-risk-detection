D. Risk Factors — Risk Related to China’s Regulation of the Education and Telecommunication Sectors and Our Corporate Structure— We rely on contractual arrangements with our VIE to operate our private primary and secondary schools and to provide services to some of our university partners, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control”, “— We may have to incur significant cost to enforce, or may not be able to effectively enforce, the contractual arrangements with our VIE and its shareholders in the event of a breach or non-compliance by our VIE or its shareholders”, and “— Certain shareholders of our VIE may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may harm our business and financial condition”. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, Hongcheng Education and its subsidiaries contributed in aggregate 22%, 22% and 22%, respectively, of our total net revenues. As of December 31, 2011 and 2012, Hongcheng Education and its subsidiaries accounted for an aggregate of 23% and 21%, respectively, of our total assets, and 18% and 17%, respectively, of our total liabilities. For additional information with respect to our relationships with Hongcheng Education, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—C. Organizational Structure.” Long-lived Assets Our accounting for long-lived assets, including property and equipment, is described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. The recorded value of long-lived assets is affected by a number of management estimates, including estimated useful lives, residual values and impairment charges. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. When these events occur, we measure impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we would recognize an impairment loss based on the fair value of the assets. Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives Goodwill represents the cost of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased. We assign all the assets and liabilities of an acquired business, including goodwill, to reporting units. We perform our goodwill impairment test on December 31 of each year. In September 2011, the FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement related to testing goodwill for impairment. The guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. We have adopted this pronouncement since 2012. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is then tested following a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. As of December 31, 2012, we had four reporting units: online degree segments, online tutoring programs, international and elite curriculum programs, and primary and secondary schools which was the only unit with no goodwill balances. 74 If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. Estimating fair value is performed by utilizing various valuation techniques. In determining the fair values of our reporting units as of December 31, 2012, we considered the discounted cash flow method, or DCF, of the income approach to be more reliable than other approaches. The discounted cash flow for each reporting unit was projected based on financial forecast developed by management for planning purposes. Cash flows beyond the forecast periods were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each reporting unit. Specifically, the income approach valuation included a revenue projection with compound annual growth rate ranging from -10.0% to 16.4% during the five years from 2013 to 2017, a cash flow discount rate ranging from 20% to 28%, and a terminal value growth rate ranging from 0% to 3%. Publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the Group was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the fair value of the reporting unit estimated using the income approach valuation methodology. Based on the result of goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2012, no impairment of goodwill was identified. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the management. Any changes in key assumptions, including unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in additional impairment charge. An intangible asset with indefinite lives that is not subject to amortization is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Such impairment test consists of comparing the fair values of assets with their carrying value amounts and an impairment loss is recognized if and when the carrying amounts exceed the fair values. The estimates of fair values of intangible assets with indefinite lives are determined using various discounted cash flow valuation methodologies. Significant assumptions are inherent in this process, including estimates of discount rates. Recently issued accounting pronouncements adopted In May 2011, the FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement on fair value measurement. The guidance is the result of joint efforts by the FASB and IASB to develop a single, converged fair value framework. The guidance is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in U.S. GAAP. The guidance expands the existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments, mainly including: ·Highest-and-best-use and valuation-premise concepts for nonfinancial assets- the guidance indicates that the highest-and-best-use and valuation-premise concepts only apply to measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets. ·Application to financial assets and financial liabilities with offsetting positions in market risks or counterparty credit risk - the guidance permits an exception to fair value measurement principles for financial assets and financial liabilities (and derivatives) with offsetting positions in market risks or counterparty credit risk when several criteria are met. When the criteria are met, an entity can measure the fair value of the net risk position. ·Premiums or discounts in fair value measure - the guidance states that "premiums or discounts that reflect size as a characteristic of the reporting entity's holding (specifically, a blockage factor that adjusts the quoted price of an asset or a liability because the market's normal daily trading volume is not sufficient to absorb the quantity held by the entity) rather than as a characteristic of the asset or liability (for example, a control premium when measuring the fair value of a controlling interest) are not permitted in a fair value measurement. ·Fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity's shareholders' equity - the guidance prescribes a model for measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in shareholders' equity; this model is consistent with the guidance on measuring the fair value of liabilities. 75 ·Disclosures about fair value measurements - the guidance expands disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 inputs. Required disclosures include: oFor fair value measurements categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy: (1) a quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement, (2) a description of the valuation process in place (e.g., how the entity decides its valuation policies and procedures, as well as changes in its analyses of fair value measurements, from period to period), and (3) a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those inputs. oThe level in the fair value hierarchy of items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but whose fair value must be disclosed. The guidance is to be applied prospectively and effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, for public entities. Early application by public entities is not permitted. We adopted this pronouncement effectively January 1, 2012, which did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. The guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The guidance should be applied retrospectively. For public entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. In December 2011, the FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement related to deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income. This guidance allows the FASB to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented. While the FASB is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments, entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect update the pronouncement issued in June 2011. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2012 and presented the total consolidated statements of comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement related to testing goodwill for impairment. The guidance is intended to simplify how entities, both public and nonpublic, test goodwill for impairment. The guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if a public entity’s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued. We adopted this pronouncement effective January 1, 2012, which did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements, as we chose to directly perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for 2012. Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In February 2013, the FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement related to reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income, to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications. Other comprehensive income includes gains and losses that are initially excluded from net income for an accounting period. Those gains and losses are later reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income. The guidance expands the exiting disclosure requirement for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements, including: 76 ·Present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income - but only if the item reclassified is required under USGAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. ·Cross-reference to other disclosures currently required under US GAAP for other reclassification items (that are not required under US GAAP) to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. This would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account (e.g., inventory for pension-related amounts) instead of directly to income or expense. For public entities, the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this pronouncement on January 1, 2013, and do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Our total net revenue in 2012 was RMB488.3 million ($78.4 million), representing a 12.0% increase, compared to RMB435.9 million in 2011. Online degree programs. Net revenue from online degree programs in 2012 was RMB393.3 million ($63.1 million), representing a 13.3% increase from RMB347.1 million in 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to strong enrollment growth in online degree programs in fiscal year 2012, particularly through our learning center network. In aggregate, our university partners had approximately 400,000 revenue students in 2012, representing a 12.4% increase from approximately 356,000 revenue students in 2011. Online tutoring programs. Net revenue from our online tutoring business decreased by approximately 1.9% from RMB25.8 million in 2011 to RMB25.3 million ($4.1 million) in 2012. The decrease was primarily due tithe revenue related to barter transactions decreased from RMB4.5 million ($0.7 million) in 2011 to RMB0.1 million ($0.02 million) in 2012.Putting this factor aside, revenue from our traditional online tutoring business and the off-line one-on-one business was actually increased by 18.3% from RMB21.3 million ($3.4 million) in 2011 to RMB25.2 million ($4.0 million) in 2012. Private primary and secondary schools. Net revenue from our private primary and secondary school business increased by approximately 20.7% from RMB49.7 million in 2011 to RMB59.9 million ($9.6 million) in 2012. This was primarily due to increased student enrollments as well as tuition fees at the Anqing private school. International and elite curriculum programs. Net revenue from our international and elite curriculum programs decreased by approximately 26.7% from RMB13.3 million in 2011 to RMB9.8 million ($1.6 million) in 2012. This decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in student enrollment as students participating in the international curriculum programs decreased from 1,800 in 2011 to 1,700 in 2012. 78 Cost of Revenue. Total cost of revenue in 2012 was RMB202.1 million ($32.4 million), representing an increase of 8.9% as compared to RMB185.6 million in 2011. Online degree programs. Cost of revenue from our online degree programs in 2012 was RMB137.7 million ($22.1 million), representing a 10.8% increase from RMB124.2 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in staff costs resulting from headcount increases across the Company, as well as an increase in courseware costs related to new training courses and the growth of students need. Additionally, the sales and service based model of our learning centers network results in a higher cost of sales. The more revenue generated from learning centers, the higher cost of revenue would incur. Online tutoring programs. Cost of revenue for our online tutoring programs increased by approximately 30.2% from RMB9.1 million in 2011 to RMB11.9 million ($1.9 million) in 2012. This increase was mainly due to increases in service costs and leasing costs. Private primary and secondary schools. Cost of revenue for our private primary and secondary schools increased by approximately 18.2% from RMB36.1 million in 2011 to RMB42.7 million ($6.9 million) in 2012. This was mostly attributable to the increased staff and transportation costs at our Anqing private school. International and elite curriculum programs. Cost of revenue for our international and elite curriculum programs decreased by approximately 39.0% from RMB16.1 million in 2011 to RMB9.8 million ($1.6 million) in 2011. This was primarily attributable to the decreases in staff costs and leasing costs in connection with the shrinking operation of our international and elite curriculum programs. Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit in 2012 was RMB286.2 million ($45.9 million) as compared with RMB250.3 million in 2011, representing an increase of 14.4%. Gross margin in 2012 was 58.6%, as compared with gross margin of 57.4% in 2011. Gross margin for the online degree programs was 65.0% in 2012 as compared with gross margin for the online degree programs of 64.2% in 2011. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the increased net revenue coupled with our stringent cost controls over the year. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses in 2012 were RMB195.0 million ($31.3 million), representing a 4.1% increase from RMB187.3 million in 2011. This increase was attributable primarily to the factors discussed below: General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses in 2012 were RMB100.2 million ($16.1 million), representing a 6.7% increase from RMB94.0 million in 2011. The increase was mainly the result of (i) fines paid for early termination of a lease agreement; (ii) an increase in stock related expenses due to granting of restricted shares to staff; and (iii) an increase in conference participation and travel expenses. Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses in 2012 were RMB48.4 million ($7.8 million), representing an 8.3% decrease from RMB52.8 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in marketing activities surrounding international and elite curriculum programs. Research and development. Research and development expenses in 2012 were RMB40.5 million ($6.5 million), representing a 0.2% decrease from RMB40.6 million in 2011. Intangible assets impairment. The Company incurred an intangible assets impairment charge in relation to the BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology) and FEC (Friendly Experimental Class) programs in the international and elite curriculum segment in the third quarter of 2012, resulting in an aggregate non-cash charge of RMB5.9 million ($0.9 million). Share-based compensation. Share-based compensation in 2012, which was allocated to the related cost of revenue and operating expenses, was RMB8.3 million ($1.3 million), representing an increase of RMB1.8 million from RMB6.5 million in 2011. Income from operations. Income from operations was RMB91.2 million ($14.6 million) in 2012, as compared to RMB62.9 million in 2011.And operating margin was 18.7% in 2012 as compared to 14.4% in 2011. 79 Interest income. Interest income increased by 49.9% to RMB13.3 million ($2.1 million) in 2012, as compared to RMB8.8 million in 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash and liquid investment balances and a higher effective interest rate in 2012 compared to 2011. Income tax provision. Income tax expense in 2012 was RMB26.4 million ($4.2 million), representing a 55.1% increase from RMB17.0 million in 2011. The increase was primarily related to the increased profit before tax for the group in 2012.The 2012 effective tax rate was 24.1%, compared with 23.2% of 2011. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was RMB45.3 million ($7.3 million) in 2012, representing a 14.1% increase as compared to RMB39.8 million in 2011, which was primarily attributable to the noncontrolling interest impact related to the increase in net income from online degree programs in 2012. Net income attributable to ChinaEdu. Net income attributable to ChinaEdu was RMB38.0 million ($6.1 million) in 2012, compared with RMB16.8 million in 2011. Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 Net Revenue. Our total net revenue in 2011 was RMB435.9 million ($69.3 million), representing a 12.1% increase, compared to RMB388.8 million in 2010. Online degree programs. Net revenue from online degree programs in 2011 was RMB347.1 million ($55.2 million), representing a 12.0% increase from RMB310.0 million in 2010. This increase was attributable primarily to the enrollment growth at our university partners’ online degree programs in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010. In the aggregate, our university partners had approximately 356,000 revenue students in 2011, representing a 14.5% increase from approximately 311,000 revenue students in 2010. Online tutoring programs. Net revenue from our online tutoring business increased approximately 8.8% from RMB23.7 million in 2010 to RMB25.8 million ($4.1 million) in 2011. The increase was primarily due to enhanced quality of service and newly developed courseware. Private primary and secondary schools. Net revenue from our private primary and secondary school business increased approximately 20.9% from RMB41.1 million in 2010 to RMB49.7 million ($7.9 million) in 2011. This was primarily due to an increase in enrollment at the Anqing private school. International and elite curriculum programs. Net revenue from our international and elite curriculum programs decreased approximately 5.5% from RMB14.1 million in 2010 to RMB13.3 million ($2.1 million) in 2011. This decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in student enrollment as students participating in the international curriculum programs decreased from 2,240 in 2010 to 1,806 in 2011. Revenue for our newly launched international elite program in 2011 was RMB2.1 million ($0.3 million). Cost of Revenue. Total cost of revenue in 2011 was RMB185.6 million ($29.5 million), representing an increase of 25.7% as compared to RMB147.7 million in 2010. Online degree programs. Cost of revenue from our online degree programs in 2011 was RMB124.2 million ($19.7 million), representing a 21.9% increase from RMB101.9 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase of RMB8.4 million ($1.3 million) related to the expansion of the Company’s learning center network and (ii) increase in employee-related costs in the amount of RMB10.1 million ($1.6 million) in 2011 as we hired additional staff in connection with efforts to enhance the current programs. Online tutoring programs. Our cost of revenue for our online tutoring programs increased approximately 49.3% from RMB6.1 million in 2010 to RMB9.1 million ($1.4 million) in 2011. This increase was mainly due to increase in employee-related costs in the amount of RMB1.8 million ($0.3 million) as we hired additional staff in connection with developing interactive and personalized learning products for our online tutoring programs. 80 Private primary and secondary schools. Our cost of revenue for our private primary and secondary schools increased approximately 19.3% from RMB30.3 million in 2010 to RMB36.1 million ($5.7 million) in 2011. This was mostly attributable to the increase in employee-related costs in the amount of RMB3.3 million ($0.5 million) and depreciation of property and equipment in the amount of RMB0.6 million ($0.1 million) in connection with the Anqing School’s new campus. International and elite curriculum programs. Our cost of revenue for our international and elite curriculum programs increased approximately 71.3% from RMB9.4 million in 2010 to RMB16.1 million ($2.6 million) in 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in employee-related and recruitment costs in connection with the expansion of our international and elite curriculum programs. Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit in 2011 was RMB250.3 million ($39.8 million) as compared with RMB241.1 million in 2010, representing an increase of 3.8%. Gross margin in 2011 was 57.4%, as compared with gross margin of 62.0% in 2010. Gross margin for the online degree programs was 64.2% in 2011 as compared with gross margin for the online degree programs of 67.1% in 2010. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in staffing and rental costs related to new business development and the expansion of the learning centers business. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses in 2011 were RMB187.3 million ($29.8 million), representing a 17.7% increase from RMB159.1 million in 2010. This increase was attributable primarily to the factors discussed below: General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses in 2011 were RMB94.0 million ($14.9 million), representing a 11.7% increase from RMB84.1 million in 2010. While general and administrative expenses increased in 2011, they made up 21.6% of net revenue in 2011, similar to 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to increased staff costs and rising costs associated with leased facilities. Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses in 2011 were RMB52.8 million ($8.4 million), representing a 40.2% increase from RMB37.6 million in 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in advertising expenses across our non-degree business lines as well as increased sales and marketing headcount at certain subsidiaries and expenses related to promotional and branding activities on a national level. Research and development. Research and development expenses in 2011 were RMB40.6 million ($6.4 million), representing an 8.6% increase from RMB37.4 million in 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to increased staff and increased depreciation expenses associated with new research and development projects for online degree programs and new business initiatives for non-online degree programs. Share-based compensation. Share-based compensation in 2011, which was allocated to the related cost of revenue and operating expenses, was RMB6.5 million ($1.0 million), representing a slight increase of RMB0.2 million from RMB6.3 million in 2010. Income from operations. As a result of the foregoing, income from operations was RMB62.9 million ($10.0 million) in 2011, as compared to RMB82.0 million in 2010 and operating margin was 14.4% in 2011 as compared to 21.1% in 2010. Interest income. Interest income increased by 59.3% to RMB8.8 million ($1.4 million) in 2011, as compared to RMB5.6 million in 2010. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in cash and liquid investment balances and a higher effective interest rate in 2011 compared to 2010. Income tax provision. Income tax expense in 2011 was RMB17.0 million ($2.7 million), representing a 27.8% increase from RMB13.3 million in 2010. The increase was primarily related to the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in 2010. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was RMB39.8 million ($6.3 million) in 2011, representing a 7.9% increase as compared to RMB36.8 million in 2010, which was primarily attributable to the noncontrolling interest impact related to the increase in net income from online degree programs in 2011. Net income attributable to ChinaEdu. Net income attributable to ChinaEdu was RMB16.8 million ($2.7 million) in 2011, compared with RMB39.3 million in 2010. 81 B.Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our initial public offering in December 2007, we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and our initial public offering. As of December 31, 2012, we had RMB478.0 million ($76.7 million) in cash and bank deposits and no borrowings. Our cash and bank deposits primarily consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and term deposits with original maturity terms of greater than three months but less than one year that are placed with banks and other financial institutions. A portion of the cash balances of our PRC-affiliated entity and its subsidiaries may be paid to us pursuant to our contractual arrangements with it and its subsidiaries for our technical and teaching support, enrollment system and other services. We may fund the cash needs of our PRC-affiliated entity from time to time. We have not encountered any difficulties meeting our cash obligations to date. Since we do not expect to make additional significant capital expenditures through the end of 2013, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated future cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated cash needs. We may, however, require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our existing cash is insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek selling additional equity securities or debt securities or borrow from lending institutions. In 2010, we completed construction of the new campus at the Anqing School. We had outstanding capital commitments of approximately RMB64.8 million as of December 31, 2012 associated with the acquisition of Jingzhou School (Southern Campus). However, due to the ongoing delays that have prevented construction at Jingzhou School (Southern Campus), we are currently unable to estimate when the outstanding RMB64.8 million capital commitment will be paid.
