As a result of our various agreements with Hongcheng Education and its respective shareholders, we are considered the primary beneficiary of Hongcheng Education and all its subsidiaries have been consolidated in our financial statements. All significant transactions and balances between us, our subsidiaries, Hongcheng Education have been eliminated upon consolidation. 67 F.

Compensation Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers For the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid aggregate cash compensation of approximately RMB4.2 million ($0.6 million) to our executive officers as a group, which includes all salary, cash bonuses, and housing allowances paid by us. Other than the grant of options to purchase an aggregate of 60,000 of our ordinary shares and the grant of 660,000 restricted share units to our selected officers in the fiscal year 2010 we did not provide any other non-cash compensation to our executive officers as a group. See “—Stock-Based Compensation Plans” and “Stock Incentive Plan-Restricted Share Units” for additional information. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid aggregate cash compensation of approximately RMB0.2 million to our three independent directors for serving as directors, we did not provide any non-cash compensation to our non-executive or independent directors. 70 Stock-Based Compensation Plans We amended our Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the “Amended Equity Incentive Plan”) by a written resolution adopted by our compensation committee on August 18, 2010. Our Amended Equity Incentive Plan changed the annual increase in number of shares available for issuance under the equity incentive plan from 2% of our outstanding shares as of December 31st of the proceeding year to 2.5% of the same. The other terms of the Amended Equity Incentive plan remain unchanged. The Amended Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of options as well as restricted shares and restricted stock units, referred to as “awards.” The purpose of the plan is to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, provide additional incentive to employees, directors and consultants, and promote the success of our business. Administration. The compensation committee of our board of directors will administer the plan. Subject to the provisions of the Amended Equity Incentive Plan, the compensation committee has the authority, in its sole discretion to, among other things, amend or modify outstanding awards under the plan, only in ways that will not be adverse to the award/option holder, including, without limitation, the repricing of “underwater” options (i.e., options with an exercise price that is higher than the current trading price of our common shares) or the replacement of an option with cash or other award type that would be treated as a repricing under the rules of the stock exchange on which the shares are listed. In addition, our shareholders also approved an amendment to the plan that eliminated the requirement that subsequent amendments to the Amended Equity Incentive Plan be submitted for shareholder approval (to the extent such shareholder approval would have been required under the stock exchange on which our securities are listed). Option Terms. Share options granted under our Amended Equity Incentive Plan may be incentive share options, or ISOs, which are intended to qualify for favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment under the provisions of Section 422 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or non-qualified share options, or NSOs, which do not so qualify. Under our Amended Equity Incentive Plan, the exercise price of ISOs cannot be less than the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the date of grant. However, in the case of an ISO granted to a grantee who at the time of grant owned shares possessing more than 10.0% of the combined voting power of all classes of our share capital (including any equity of any of our Chinese subsidiaries), the option price may not be less than 110.0% of the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the date of grant of such ISO and the option period may not be greater than five years from the date of grant. The exercise price for NSOs is determined by the board of directors but may not be less than the fair market value of ordinary shares on the date of grant. Eligibility. Under our Amended Equity Incentive Plan, awards may be issued to employees, non-employee directors or consultants of our company or our Chinese subsidiaries, although ISOs may only be issued to our employees or the employees of our Chinese subsidiaries. Option Exercise and Termination of Awards. Share options granted under the plan may be exercised within the option period specified by our board of directors or the compensation committee (after it is established), which shall not be more than ten years from the date of option grant. If an option holder’s service terminates due to the option holder’s death or disability, the unvested portion of a share option is forfeited and the vested portion is still exercisable for a period of one year following the option holder’s death or disability or until the expiration of the option period (if sooner). If an option holder’s service ends for reasons other than death or disability, the unvested portion of a share option will be forfeited and the vested portion will be exercisable for a period of ninety days following the option holder’s termination or until the expiration of the option period (if sooner). Awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units that are unvested will be forfeited at the time of termination of service. Third-Party Acquisition. If a third party acquires us through a merger or consolidation transaction in which we are not the surviving corporation, all outstanding share options will be substituted by the surviving or resulting corporation. We are authorized to cancel any outstanding options upon the effective date of any such transaction, provided that we notify each option holder of our intention to do so at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the transaction and permit the optionees to exercise their options in full during this period. We are also authorized to cancel any outstanding awards and pay or deliver to the holder an amount in cash or securities having a value equal to the formula or fixed price per share paid to shareholders in the case of restricted stock or restricted stock units. In the case of options, the holder will receive an amount equal to the product of the number of shares subject to the option multiplied by the amount, if any, by which the formula or fixed price per share paid to shareholders in the transaction exceeds the option exercise price applicable to such award. Amendment and Termination of Plan. Our board of directors may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the Amended Equity Incentive Plan without shareholder approval. However, any amendment, suspension or termination of the plan may not adversely affect awards already granted without consent of the recipient of such awards. Unless terminated earlier, the Amended Equity Incentive Plan shall continue in effect for a term of ten years from the date of adoption. 71 As of June 10, 2011, our board of directors has authorized the issuance of up to 16,797,400 ordinary shares upon exercise of awards granted under our equity incentive plan, with an increase each year equal to 2.5% of the outstanding number of shares as of the immediately preceding year ended December 31. As of June 10, 2011, options to purchase 9,869,938 ordinary shares were outstanding and options to purchase 864,269 ordinary shares remained available for future option grants.

Up to 50%, 33.3% and 16.7% of the granted restricted shares may vest subject to our achievement of gross revenue performance target set for 2013, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The following table summarizes, as of June 10, 2011, the Restricted Share Units granted under the program to our directors and executive officers: Name Number of Restricted Share Units Price (US$/Share) Vesting Dates Julia Huang 360,000 _ 2013, 2015 and 2016 Shawn Ding 300,000 _ 2013, 2015 and 2016 Pension and Similar Benefits Full time employees of our company in the PRC participate in a government-mandated defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain pension benefits, medical care, unemployment insurance, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to employees.
