ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. We have experienced declines in the volume of cases referred to us for many of our service lines associated with the property and casualty insurance industry. We are unable to predict the future of this trend due to the following factors:  changes in the degree to which property and casualty insurance carriers outsource their claims handling functions;  changes in the overall employment levels and associated workplace injury rates in the U.S;  the growth of alternative risk programs and the use of independent third party administrators such as us, as opposed to administrators affiliated with brokers or insurance carriers;  occurrences of weather-related, natural, and man-made disasters;  major insurance carriers, underwriters, and brokers could elect to expand their activities as third party administrators and adjusters, which would directly compete with our business;  the renewal of existing major contracts with clients and our ability to obtain such renewals and new contracts on satisfactory financial terms, including the creditworthiness of clients. 10 Table of Contents Legal Settlement Administration service revenues are project-based and can fluctuate significantly. Our Legal Settlement Administration service revenues are project-based and can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Growth in these revenues is in part dependent on the continued growth in product liability and securities class action settlements. Legislation or a change in market conditions could curtail or limit growth of this part of our business. Tort reforms in the U.S., both at the national and state levels, could limit the number and size of future class action settlements. We may not be able to identify new revenue sources not directly tied to the insurance underwriting cycle. The insurance industry may go through a hard market cycle in the future. Indicators of a hard insurance underwriting cycle include higher premiums, lower liability limits, excluded coverages, reservation of rights letters and unpaid claims. During a hard insurance underwriting market, insurance companies become very selective in the risks they underwrite and insurance premiums and policy deductibles increase. This results in a reduction in industry-wide claims volumes, which reduces claim referrals to us unless we can offset the decline in claim referrals with growth in our market share. In softer insurance markets, where insurance premium and deductible levels are generally in decline, as is currently being experienced, industry-wide claim volumes generally increase, which should increase claim referrals to us provided property and casualty insurance carriers do not reduce the number of claims they outsource to independent firms such as ours. We are subject to this insurance underwriting market risk and try to mitigate this risk through the development and marketing of services which are not affected by the insurance underwriting cycle, such as those related to class action services. We may not be able to develop or acquire information technology resources to support and grow our business. We have made substantial investments in software and related technologies that are critical to the core operations of our business. These information technology resources will require future maintenance and enhancements, potentially at substantial costs. Additionally, these information technology resources may become obsolete in the future and require replacement, potentially at substantial costs. We may not be able to develop or acquire replacement resources or to identify and acquire new technology resources to support and grow our business. We may not be able to recruit, train, and retain qualified personnel, including retaining a sufficient number of on-call claims adjusters to respond to catastrophic events that may, singularly or in combination, significantly increase our clients needs for adjusters. Our catastrophe revenues can fluctuate dramatically based on natural and man-made disasters. When such events happen, our clients usually require a sudden and substantial increase in the need for catastrophe adjusting services, which can place strains on the 11 Table of Contents capacity of our catastrophe adjusters. Our internal resources are sometimes not sufficient to meet these sudden and substantial increases in demand. When these situations occur, we must retain outside adjusters (contractors and temporary employees) to increase our capacity. Insurance companies and other loss adjusting firms also aggressively compete for these independent adjusters, who often command high prices for their services at such times of peak demand. We are party to lawsuits that could adversely impact our business. In the normal course of the claims administration services business, we are named as a defendant in suits by insureds or claimants contesting decisions by us or our clients with respect to the settlement of claims. Additionally, our clients have brought actions for indemnification on the basis of alleged negligence on our part or on the part of our agents or our employees in rendering service to clients. We currently are party to other litigation. There can be no assurance that additional lawsuits will not be filed against us. There also can be no assurance that these lawsuits will not have a disruptive effect upon the operations of our business, that the defense of the lawsuits will not consume the time and attention of our senior management or that the resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our U.S. and United Kingdom (U.K.) defined benefit pension plans are significantly under funded. Future funding requirements, including those imposed by recent and potential regulatory changes, could restrict cash available for our operating, financing and investing requirements. At the end of the most recent measurement periods for our defined benefit pension plan, our projected benefit obligations were underfuned by $93,708,000. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) may require us to make substantial contributions to our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan over the next seven years in order for us to meet the Funding Target Liability as defined in the Act. In addition, regulatory requirements in the U.K. may require us to make additional contributions to our underfunded U.K. defined benefit pension plans. Required contributions to our underfunded defined benefit pension plans may restrict available cash for our operating, financing, and investing needs. 12 Table of Contents In 2006, we made a major business acquisition by acquiring one of our competitors. We financed this acquisition by using variable-rate debt. In connection with our October 31, 2006 acquisition of Broadspire Management Services, Inc., we refinanced our existing fixed-rate long-term debt with variable-rate long-term debt and increased our outstanding borrowings by approximately $152 million under a new credit agreement in order to acquire Broadspire Management Services, Inc. As a result, we have incurred substantial additional debt that incurs interest charges based on variable interest rates. These variable interest rates may increase or decrease based on market conditions or they may increase if we do not meet certain levels of compliance with the related debt covenants. We are in the process of integrating the acquired operations of Broadspire Management Services, Inc. into the existing operations of our Broadspire operating segment. This integration is accompanied by restructuring activities including restructuring activities within our existing Broadspire operations, where we have experienced negative operating margins in recent years. There is no guarantee that we will successfully and profitably integrate the acquired Broadspire Management Services, Inc. into our existing Broadspire operations. If we do not realize planned operating synergies within the new combined Broadspire operations, earnings (or losses) and operating cash flows may not cover the interest charges and interest payments on the additional borrowings we incurred to fund our acquisition within this segment. Additionally, if we do not achieve these planned operating synergies, it may be difficult for us to meet our debt covenants in the future or resume the payments of cash dividends to our shareholders. We have debt covenants that require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum consolidated net worth. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these debt covenant requirements. These debt covenant requirements also have requirements on our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. 13 Table of Contents On October 31, 2006, we entered into a Credit Agreement by and among us, Crawford & Company International, Inc., the lenders party thereto and SunTrust Bank, as Issuing Bank and Administrative Agent for the Lenders, which we refer to herein as the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting liens, indebtedness, guaranties, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, sale and leasebacks, restrictions on dividends and distributions, and other fundamental changes. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains covenants to the effect that we will maintain a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth. We were in compliance with these debt covenants as of December 31, 2006. If we do not meet the covenant requirements in the future, we would be in default under these agreements. In such an event, we would need to obtain a waiver of the default or repay the outstanding indebtedness under the agreements. If we could not obtain a waiver on satisfactory terms, we could be required to renegotiate this indebtedness. Any such renegotiations could result in less favorable terms, including higher interest rates and accelerated payments. Based upon our projected operating results for 2007, we expect to remain in compliance with these debt covenants. However, there can be no assurance that our actual financial results will match our planned results or that we will not violate the covenants. We may be obligated to make earnout payments related to our acquisitions. We normally structure business acquisitions to include earnout payments, which are contingent upon the acquired entity reaching certain revenue and operating earnings targets. The amount of the contingent payments and length of the earnout period varies for each acquisition, and the ultimate payments when made will vary, as they are dependent on future events. Based on 2006 levels of revenues and operating earnings, additional payments under existing earnout agreements approximate $6.5 million through 2010, as follows: 2007  $0; 2008  $767,000; 2009  $5.0 million; and 2010  $777,000. The risks included above are not exhaustive. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of known risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
