ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We urge you to carefully review the following discussion of the specific risks and uncertainties that affect our business. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Gaming licenses, regulatory approvals and gaming legislation impact our ability to operate our business and sell and lease our products: Ø The manufacture and distribution of gaming machines is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulations and taxes. Most of the jurisdictions in which we operate require licenses, permits, documentation of qualification, including evidence of financial stability, and other forms of approval of our company and our officers, directors, major security holders and key personnel. Licenses, approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked, suspended or conditioned. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary registrations, licenses, permits or approvals, that the licensing process will not result in delays or adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain key personnel, or that complying with these regulations will not increase our costs. Ø The gaming authorities in some jurisdictions may investigate individuals who have a material relationship with us or security holders to determine whether the selected individual or security holder is acceptable to those gaming authorities. While any such investigated related individual or security holder must pay the costs of the investigation, such an investigation may be time consuming and distracting to our operations. Ø Each of our games and gaming machine hardware and software must be approved in each jurisdiction in which it is placed, and we cannot assure you that a particular game, hardware or software will be approved in any jurisdiction. Our server-based gaming technology will require regulatory approval in gaming jurisdictions prior to any implementation. Ø To expand into new jurisdictions, we may need to be licensed, obtain approvals of our products and/or seek licensure of our officers, directors, major security holders, key personnel or business partners. If we fail to seek, do not receive or receive a revocation of a license in a particular jurisdiction for our games, hardware or software, we cannot sell or place on a participation or leased basis our products in that jurisdiction. Ø Delays in, amendments to or repeals of legislation approving gaming or the expansion of gaming in jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to commence operations, may adversely affect our operations. Delays in approvals of our customers operations or expansions of their operations may adversely affect our operations. Ø Some jurisdictions require gaming manufacturers to obtain government approval before engaging in some transactions, such as business combinations, reorganizations, borrowings, stock offerings and repurchases. Obtaining such pre-approvals can be time consuming and costly. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary approvals or that the approval process will not result in delays or changes to our business plans. Our profitability depends on our ability to timely develop new technologies and high earning products that appeal to the player: Ø The gaming machine business is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the introduction of new products using such technologies. We must continually adapt our products to incorporate new technologies and if we cannot adapt, or do not timely adapt new technologies, our operations may be adversely impacted. 21 Table of Contents Ø The success of a newly introduced technology, such as server-based gaming, is dependent on our casino customers acceptance of a dynamic change in the way they manage their casino floors. While we have designed WAGE-NET to support our customers existing investment in our Bluebird products, such acceptance may nevertheless only build gradually over time. Delays in acceptance by our customers of our new technology may adversely affect our operations. Ø Our success depends upon our ability to adapt our manufacturing capabilities and processes to meet the demands of producing new and innovative products. Because our newer products are generally more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past, we must continually refine our production capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation. If we cannot efficiently adapt our manufacturing infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations, or if we are unable to make upgrades to our production capacity in a timely manner, our business could be negatively impacted. Ø Our success also depends on continually developing and successfully marketing new games and gaming machines with strong and sustained player appeal. A new game or gaming machine will be accepted by casino operators only if we can show that it is likely to produce more revenue to the operator than competitors products. Gaming machines can be installed in casinos on a trial basis, and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the casinos. Additionally, we are at risk that customers may cancel orders for products that are not performing at other casinos. If a new product does not achieve significant market acceptance, we may not recover our development and promotion costs. Ø Participation gaming machines are replaced by casino operators if the gaming machines do not meet and sustain revenue and profitability expectations. Therefore, these gaming machines are particularly susceptible to pressure from competitors, declining popularity, changes in economic conditions and increased taxation and are at risk of replacement by the casinos, which would end our recurring revenues from these machines until they can be placed with another customer or repurposed. Ø Our success depends on our ability to avoid, detect, replicate and correct software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our gaming machines and associated software. Our gaming machines and software have experienced anomalies and fraudulent manipulation in the past. Games and gaming machines may be replaced by casinos and other gaming machine operators if they do not perform according to expectations, or may be shut down by regulators. The occurrence of anomalies in, or fraudulent manipulation of, our gaming machines and software may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities including suspension or revocation of our gaming licenses, or disciplinary action. Additionally, in the event of such issues with our gaming machines and software, substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues, which may delay our other projects. We are dependent on our intellectual property and trade secrets: Ø Our competitors have been granted patents covering, among other items, numerous gaming machine features, bonusing techniques and related technologies. If our products use processes or other subject matter that is claimed under these existing patents, or if other companies obtain patents claiming subject matter that we use, those companies may bring infringement actions against us. We might then be forced to discontinue the affected products or be required to obtain licenses from the company holding the patent, if it is willing to give us a license, in order to continue to develop, manufacture or market our products. We might also be found liable for treble damage claims relating to past use of the patented subject matter if the infringement is found to be willful. Ø Substantially all of our gaming machines utilize trademarks and other intellectual properties licensed from third parties. Our future success may depend upon our ability to obtain, retain and/or expand licenses for additional popular intellectual properties in a competitive market. In the event that we cannot renew and/or expand existing licenses, we may be required to discontinue or limit our use of the games or gaming machines that use the licensed technology or bear the licensed marks. 22 Table of Contents Ø Our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain trademark protection for the names or symbols under which we market our products and to obtain copyright protection and patent protection of our proprietary software and other game innovations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to build and maintain goodwill in our trademarks or obtain trademark or patent protection, that any trademark, copyright or issued patent will provide competitive advantages for us or that our intellectual properties will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors. Ø We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and independent contractors regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information, but we cannot assure you that the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or proprietary information will be honored. Despite various confidentiality agreements and other trade secret protections, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how could become known to, or independently developed by, competitors. Ø We have entered into multiple agreements to license intellectual property and technologies that, as of June 30, 2007, had a net book value of $66.7 million and total potential future commitments of $27.3 million. If we determine that we may not realize the value of any of the net assets or commitments, we would record an immediate charge against earnings up to the full amount of these net assets that are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet or commitments in the period in which such determination is made. Refer to Note 7, Intangible Assets of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further information on the amount of intellectual property and technologies recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Note 13, Commitments, Contingencies and Indemnifications for further information on total potential future commitments. Our industry is competitive: Ø The gaming machine business is intensely competitive. Some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial, marketing and product development resources than ours. In addition, new competitors may enter our key markets. Obtaining space and favorable placement on casino gaming floors is a competitive factor in our industry. Competitors with a larger installed base of gaming machines than ours have an advantage in obtaining and retaining the most space and best positions in casinos. Ø In addition, some of our competitors have developed and sell or otherwise provide to customers centralized player tracking and accounting systems which allow operators to accumulate accounting and performance data about the operation of gaming machines. While, with the acquisition of SiP, we can now offer a centralized player tracking and accounting system, we anticipate it will only be used in small international casinos. By not having such a system for large casinos, we are at a competitive disadvantage. Our business is subject to other economic, political, market, and financial risks: Ø The gaming industry can be affected by public opinion of gaming. In the event that there is a decline in public acceptance of gaming, either through unfavorable legislation affecting the introduction of gaming into emerging markets, or through legislative and regulatory changes, including tax increases, in existing gaming markets, our ability to continue to sell and lease our gaming machines in those markets and jurisdictions would be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that public opinion will continue to support legalized gaming. Ø Our gross margins are impacted by increases to our costs of goods sold including higher materials costs due to the fluctuating commodities markets, higher labor costs and increased freight charges reflecting escalating gas prices. Ø We face risks associated with doing business in international markets related to political and economic instability and related foreign currency fluctuations. Unstable governments and changes in treaties and 23 Table of Contents legislation may affect the international gaming market with respect to gaming regulation, taxation, tariffs and import duties, and the legality of gaming in some markets, as we experienced with the Russian market in fiscal 2006. Additionally, we may have increased costs in connection with complying with international laws. Ø Compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including new regulations requiring higher standards, may increase our costs, limit our ability to utilize our current supply chain and force design changes to our products. These changes could reduce the net realizable value of our inventory, which would result in an immediate charge to our Consolidated Statements of Income. Non-compliance could negatively impact our operations and financial position as a result of fines, penalties, the cost of mandated remediation or delays to our manufacturing. Ø Customer financing is becoming an increasingly prevalent component of the sales process and therefore increases business risk of non-payment, especially in emerging markets. These customer financing arrangements also delay our receipt of cash and can negatively impact our ability to enforce our rights upon default if the customer is from an international country. Ø Our competitors have begun to provide free game conversions to customers in connection with product sales. As a result, in certain sales of new gaming machines we have offered free game conversions, while at the same time we continue to charge our customers for game conversions, including CPU-NXT upgrade kits. We cannot be sure that competitive pressure will not cause us to increase the number of free game conversions we offer to our customers, which would decrease the revenue we expect to receive for game conversions. Ø If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal controls over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we may suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations. Additionally, the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud, regardless of the adequacy of those controls. Ø Our credit facility contains financial covenants which may restrict our ability to, among other things, make certain capital expenditures; incur additional debt; incur liens; change the nature of our business; merge with or acquire other companies, liquidate or dissolve; and sell, transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. We are dependent on our employees: Ø The loss or unavailability of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect on our operations. Ø Our ability to continue to develop new technologies and create innovative products depends on our ability to retain and recruit talented employees. A lack of skilled, technical workers could delay or negatively impact our business plans. The use of our rights plan or preferred stock would inhibit the acquisition of WMS or have a dilutive effect on our stock: Ø Under our rights plan, each share of our common stock has an accompanying right to purchase convertible preferred stock that permits each holder to purchase shares of our common stock at half price. The rights become exercisable if any person or entity who at the time of the adoption of the rights plan did not own 15% or more of our common stock subsequently acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors. We can redeem the rights at $.01 per right, subject to specified conditions, at any time. The rights expire in November 2007 and our 24 Table of Contents board of directors has determined not to renew or adopt a new rights plan at this time. Our board of directors could use this agreement as an anti-takeover device to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control. The use of our rights plan may dilute our common stock. Ø Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of five million shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences that may be determined from time to time by the board of directors. Accordingly, our board has broad power, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. Our board of directors could use preferred stock to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control. Our board has no current plans, agreements or commitments to issue any shares of preferred stock. The existence of the preferred stock, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Sumner Redstone owns or controls 9% of our outstanding common stock, and may dispose of all or a portion of his remaining stock ownership at any time, which could cause our stock price to decrease: Ø Sumner Redstone beneficially owns 4,637,760 shares, or 9%, of our common stock, as reported in amendment no. 53 to a Form 13D filed with the SEC on May 15, 2007, as adjusted for our three-for-two stock split effected in May 2007. Mr. Redstone could sell any or all of his shares at any time on the open market or to a person who wishes to acquire control of us. Such a sale may require prior regulatory approval. We cannot assure you that any such person would agree with our strategy and business goals described in this Report. Sales by Mr. Redstone of a large number of shares would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In August 2005, we executed a five-year extension through August 2010 of a voting trust agreement, which governs the voting rights of all shares of our common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Redstone. Mr. Brian R. Gamache, our President and Chief Executive Officer, acts as the proxy holder under the voting trust agreement with Mr. Redstone. We are dependent on the success and growth of our customers: Ø Our success depends on our customers buying our products to expand their existing operations, replace existing gaming machines, or equip a new casino. Any slow down in the replacement cycle or delays in expansions or new openings may negatively impact our operations. Ø Casino operators in the gaming industry are undergoing a period of consolidation. The result of this trend is that a smaller number of companies control a larger percentage of our current and potential customer base. Because a significant portion of our sales come from repeat customers, to the extent one of our customers is sold to or merges with an entity that utilizes more of one of our competitors products and services, or that reduces spending on our products, our business could be negatively impacted. Additionally, to the extent the new owner allocates capital to expenditures other than gaming machines, such as hotel furnishings, restaurants and other improvements, or generally reduces expenditures, our business could be negatively impacted. Risks that impact our customers may impact us if fewer players visit our customers facilities, if such players have less disposable income to spend at our customers facilities or if our customers are unable to devote resources to purchasing and leasing our products including: Ø Global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility. Ø Natural disasters such as major fires, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. Ø Adverse economic and market conditions in gaming markets, including recession, economic slowdown, higher interest rates, higher airfares and higher energy and gasoline prices. Ø Concerns about SARS, Avian flu or other influenza or contagious illnesses. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
