ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Accrued Bonuses The Company pays bonuses to certain executive management, field management and corporate employees based on, or after giving consideration to, a variety of financial performance measures. Executive management, field management, and certain corporate employees' bonuses are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first quarter of the following year, based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets. Variances in actual results versus budgeted amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore the estimates of the required accruals. Accordingly, the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from the estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals. Litigation The Company is currently, and may in the future become, involved in legal proceedings and claims arising from time to time in the course of its business, including the litigation described in Note 15 (Contingencies) to the financial statements. An adverse outcome to the referenced litigation or other cases arising in the future could have an adverse impact on the financial position and results of operations of the Company. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ITEM 1B.
