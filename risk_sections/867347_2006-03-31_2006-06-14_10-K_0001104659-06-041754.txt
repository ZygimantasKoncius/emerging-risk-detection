Item 1A. Risk Factors DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. These risks include those that we consider to be significant at this time to investment decisions regarding our common stock. There may be risks that you, in particular, view differently than we do, and there are other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know of or that we currently deem immaterial, but that may, in fact, harm our business in the future. If any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should consider carefully the following factors, in addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our company and business. BECAUSE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE GENERALLY FIXED AND THE TIMING OF OUR REVENUES FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER IS HIGHLY VARIABLE, OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO HIGH VOLATILITY. While our products and services are not seasonal, our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. If our quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially. A large part of our sales typically occurs in the last month of a quarter, frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter. If these sales were delayed from one quarter to the next for any reason, our operating results could fluctuate dramatically. In addition, our sales cycles may vary, making the timing of sales difficult to predict. Furthermore, our infrastructure costs are generally fixed. As a result, modest fluctuations in revenues between quarters may cause large fluctuations in operating results. These factors all tend to make the timing of revenues unpredictable and may lead to high period-to-period fluctuations in operating results. Our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate for several additional reasons, many of which are outside of our control, including the following: · demand for our products and services; · the timing of new product introductions and sales of our products and services; · unexpected delays in introducing new products and services; · increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, research and development, administration or services; · changes in the rapidly evolving market for Web content management solutions; · the mix of revenues from product licenses and services, as well as the mix of products licensed; · the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our staff or third-party contractors; · the mix of domestic and international sales; · costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses; · general economic conditions; and · public announcements by our competitors. 8 WE HAVE A HISTORY OF MAKING ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING LARGE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, AND FUTURE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO COMPLETE OR TO INTEGRATE AND MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AND CAUSE OUR OPERATING RESULTS TO SUFFER. We may seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. If we identify an appropriate acquisition opportunity, we may be unable to negotiate favorable terms for that acquisition, successfully finance the acquisition or integrate the new business or products into our existing business and operations. In addition, the negotiation of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses or products may divert management time and resources from our existing business and operations. To finance acquisitions, we may use a substantial portion of our available cash or we may issue additional securities, which would cause dilution to our shareholders. WE MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH WOULD CAUSE OUR FINANCIAL POSITION TO SUFFER AND MAY CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK TO FALL. Our revenues may not grow in future periods and we may not sustain profitability. If we do not sustain profitability, our financial position will suffer and the market price of our stock may fall. Our ability to sustain profitable operations depends upon many factors beyond our direct control. These factors include, but are not limited to: · the demand for our products; · our ability to quickly introduce new products; · the level of product and price competition; · our ability to control costs; and · general economic conditions. THE INTENSE COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY FROM RECENT AND EXPECTED INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY REDUCE OUR FUTURE SALES AND PROFITS. The market for our products is highly competitive and is likely to become more competitive from recent and expected industry consolidation. We may not be able to compete successfully in our chosen marketplace, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additional competition may cause pricing pressure, reduced sales and margins, or prevent our products from gaining and sustaining market acceptance. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases, and substantially more resources than we have. Competitors with greater resources than ours may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new opportunities, changing technology, product standards or customer requirements. WE DEPEND ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL; IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR OPERATING PLAN, AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS, MAY SUFFER. We are a small company and depend greatly on the knowledge and experience of our senior management team and other key personnel. If we lose any of these key personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional personnel with the highly specialized expertise necessary to generate revenue and to engineer, design and support our products and services. Like other software companies, we face intense competition for qualified personnel. We may not be able to attract or retain such personnel. 9 WE HAVE RELIED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO RELY ON SALES OF OUR CONTENT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE, FOR OUR REVENUES; IF OUR CONTENT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE DOES NOT GAIN AND MAINTAIN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER. We currently derive all of our revenues from product licenses and services associated with our suite of content management and viewing, software products. The market for these products is new and rapidly evolving. We cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will continue or that it will be sustainable. If we do not increase employee productivity and revenues related to our existing products or generate revenues from new products and services, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We will continue to depend on revenues related to new and enhanced versions of our software products for the foreseeable future. Our success will largely depend on our ability to increase sales from existing products and generate sales from product enhancements and new products. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in upgrading and marketing our existing products or that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services. The market for our products is highly competitive and is subject to rapid technological change. Technological advances could make our products less attractive to customers and adversely affect our business. In addition, complex software product development involves certain inherent risks, including risks that errors may be found in a product enhancement or new product after its release, even after extensive testing, and the risk that discovered errors may not be corrected in a timely manner. IF WE CANNOT COST-EFFECTIVELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OUR PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY SUFFER. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or incur significant expense in doing so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Any steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate, time consuming and expensive. Without significant patent or copyright protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who develop functionally equivalent products. We may also be subject to claims that our current products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claim may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We anticipate that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims due to growth in the number of products and competitors in our industry, and the overlap in functionality of products in different industries. Any infringement claim, regardless of its merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to defend, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. We rely on trade secret protection, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary information. Despite our attempts to protect our confidential and proprietary information, others may gain access to this information. Alternatively, other companies may independently develop substantially equivalent information. OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH COMMERCIAL WEB BROWSERS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS, WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM OUR PRODUCTS. Our products utilize interfaces that are compatible with commercial Web browsers. In addition, our Stellent Content Management System is a server-based system written in Java that functions in both Windows NT and UNIX environments. We must continually modify our products to conform to commercial Web browsers and operating systems. If our products were to become incompatible with commercial Web browsers and operating systems, our business would be harmed. In addition, uncertainty related to the timing and nature of product introductions or modifications by vendors of Web browsers and 10 operating systems may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS IF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS DAMAGE CUSTOMERS DATA, FAIL TO MAINTAIN ACCESS SECURITY OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO PERFORM TO SPECIFICATIONS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION AND REDUCE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK. If software errors or design defects in our products cause damage to customers data and our agreements do not protect us from related product liability claims, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we could be subject to product liability claims if our security features fail to prevent unauthorized third parties from entering our customers intranet, extranet or Internet Websites. Our software products are complex and sophisticated and may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct. Errors, bugs or viruses spread by third parties may result in the loss of market acceptance or the loss of customer data. Our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to product liability claims may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions where we operate. FUTURE REGULATION OF THE INTERNET COULD BE ADOPTED THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR BUSINESS, WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM OUR PRODUCTS. Federal, state or foreign agencies may adopt new legislation or regulations governing the use and quality of Web content. We cannot predict if or how any future laws or regulations would impact our business and operations. Even though these laws and regulations may not apply to our business directly, they could indirectly harm us to the extent that they impact our customers and potential customers. WE HAVE BEEN NAMED A DEFENDANT IN SECURITIES CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS AND WE MAY IN THE FUTURE BE NAMED IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERT MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AND RESOURCES. Shareholder class-action suits have been filed naming Stellent and certain of our current and former officers and directors as co-defendants. We have reached a final settlement during fiscal year 2006 and we do not anticipate any further litigation costs associated with lawsuit. Also, certain current and former officers and directors were named in a derivative lawsuit that followed the completion of a special litigation committee process in which the plaintiff, on behalf of the Corporation, alleged that the board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing certain circumstances to exist that gave rise to the Federal case described above. A special litigation committee has recommended that the Company not pursue an action against the Board and/or the Companys officers. The Company moved to dismiss the action. While the motion to dismiss was pending the Company's insurance carriers, because of the ongoing expense of litigation and the role the plaintiff's counsel played in the special litigation committee process, agreed to settle the pending derivative lawsuit for a payment of $250,000. The settlement is subject to preliminary and final court approval. The settlement will be paid entirely from proceeds of an insurance policy. Securities class-action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their securities. This risk is greater for technology companies, which have experienced greater-than-average stock price volatility in recent years and, as a result, have been subject to, on average, a greater number of securities class-action claims than companies in other industries. We may in the future again be the target of this kind of litigation, and such litigation could also result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources. 11 THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO VARIATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS, CHANGES IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future. The market price of our common stock may be affected by each of the following factors, many of which are outside of our control: · variations in quarterly operating results; · changes in estimates by securities analysts; · changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; · announcements of significant events, such as major sales; · acquisitions of businesses or losses of major customers; and · sales of our equity securities. WE CAN ISSUE SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. Our articles of incorporation permit us to establish the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions, including voting rights, of unissued shares of our capital stock and to issue such shares without approval from our shareholders. The rights of holders of our common stock may suffer as a result of the rights granted to holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, we could issue preferred stock to prevent a change in control of our company, depriving shareholders of an opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of the prevailing market price. OUR SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF MINNESOTA LAW MAY MAKE A TAKEOVER OF STELLENT DIFFICULT, DEPRIVING SHAREHOLDERS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SELL SHARES AT ABOVE-MARKET PRICES. Our shareholder rights plan and certain provisions of Minnesota law may have the effect of discouraging attempts to acquire Stellent without the approval of our board of directors. Consequently, our shareholders may lose opportunities to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price. WHEN WE BEGIN ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION USING THE FAIR VALUE METHOD, IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COMPENSATION EXPENSE. In December 2004, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, known as Statement 123(R). Statement 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. Under APB Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense is recognized for employee stock option grants if the exercise price of the Companys stock option grants is at or above the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the determination of the fair value of the share-based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests, which will increase our compensation expense significantly. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) effective April 1, 2006. As part of this adoption, we began expensing options effective April 1, 2006. Based on the current amount of outstanding stock options that will vest on or after April 1, 2006, we anticipate recognizing $4.0 million to $6.0 million of compensation expense during fiscal year 2007. This amount will fluctuate depending on future stock options granted to or forfeited by employees and directors. 12 NEW LEGISLATION IS LIKELY TO IMPACT OUR FUTURE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Recently, there have been significant regulatory changes, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that will continue to have an impact on our future consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rule changes and proposed legislative initiatives which following several highly publicized corporate accounting and corporate governance failures, have increased general and administrative costs. Additional regulatory changes may increase our costs further. Further, the impact of these changes may increase costs incurred by our customers and prospects, which could result in delays or cancellations in spending on enterprise content management software and services like those that we provide. Such delays and cancellations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statement of operations and financial condition. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
