D. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company and Our Industry We have incurred losses starting from the expiration of the license of World of Warcraft, or WoW. We may continue to incur losses in the future and may not maintain profitability. We incurred a net loss of RMB409.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 due to the non-renewal of the WoW license agreement. We incurred a net loss of RMB518.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 and a net loss of RMB313.2 million (US$49.8 million) in the year ended December 31, 2011, because we have not identified a product to replace the WoW game and we continue to incur product development expenses for our new products. We may continue to incur losses and may not be able to achieve profitability. We expect our operating expenses to increase as we expand our operations. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on the competitiveness of our products and services as well as our ability to control costs and to provide new products and services to meet the demands of our customers. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our business, we may not be able to achieve short-term or long-term profitability or at all. If we continue to incur losses and fail to achieve profitability in the future, the market price of our ADSs could decline. If we are unable to successfully establish new relationships with online game developers and maintain a satisfactory relationship with the online game developers that have licensed games to us, our future results of operations and profitability will be materially impacted. We rely heavily on our relationships with online game developers that have licensed games to us. Despite our effort to expand our capacity to develop our own proprietary games, we significantly rely and will continue to significantly rely on our relationships with, among others, game licensors such as Webzen, Inc., or Webzen, Ndoors Corporation, or Ndoors, and USERJOY Technology Co., Ltd., or USERJOY. The licenses of the games we now operate generally have terms ranging from three to four years, and may or may not be renewed upon expiration. As an illustration, until June 2009, we had relied heavily on our relationship with Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. which permitted our subsidiary, China The9 Interactive Limited, or C9I, to operate WoW, in China through cooperation with Shanghai IT, our affiliated PRC entity. Our agreement with Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., which expired on June 7, 2009, accounted for approximately 88% of our total revenues in 2009. On November 22, 2010, our license agreement with HanbitSoft Inc., or HanbitSoft, and IMC Games Co., Ltd. to operate Granado Espada, or GE, expired and was not renewed. Our game licenses may also be terminated before expiration. For example, on December 2, 2010, we entered into an agreement with EA Swiss Sàrl to prematurely terminate the EA Sports FIFA Online 2 license, which would otherwise have expired in May 2012, and to cease commercial operation of the game in China. We ceased to operate the game in China in October 2011. 4 Table of Contents In order for our business strategy to be successful in the near term, we will need to obtain new online game licenses and renew existing licenses, in addition to developing proprietary games that are attractive to users. Our business depends significantly upon our licenses to operate online games in China. Therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially impacted if we are unable to obtain new online game licenses in the future. In addition, if we are unable to maintain a satisfactory relationship with the online game developers resulting in licenses not being renewed or licenses being prematurely terminated, or should any of these game licensors either establish similar or more favorable relationships with our competitors in violation of their contractual arrangements with us, or otherwise, our operating results and our business would be harmed. We cannot assure you that any of our online game licensors will renew their license agreements with us, or grant us a license for any new online games that they will develop or make available to us expansion packs for existing games. Any deterioration in our relationships with our online game licensors could harm our future results of operations or the growth of our business. Our business is intensely competitive and hit driven. If we do not deliver new hit products to the market, or if consumers prefer our competitors products or services over those we provide, our operating results will suffer. We operate in a highly competitive and dynamic market, and our future success depends not only on the popularity of our existing online games but also, in large part, on our ability to develop and introduce new games that are attractive to our customers. To achieve this, we will need to anticipate and effectively adapt to rapidly changing consumer tastes and preferences and technological advances. The development of new games can be very difficult and requires high levels of innovation. We do not have a proven track record of developing proprietary massively multiplayer online role playing games, or MMORPGs, massively multiplayer online first-person shooter game, or MMOFPSs, web games, social games or mobile games. While new products are regularly introduced, only a small number of hit titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in our industry. There is no assurance that any new game, proprietary, licensed or otherwise, to be introduced by us from time to time, including those named in Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewProducts and Services, could become hit products and widely accepted by the customers and the market. Hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of the market than we anticipate, which could cause revenues generated by our products to fall below expectations. If our competitors develop more successful products, or offer similar products at lower price points or pursuant to payment models viewed as offering a better value than we do, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Also, in order to maintain the life span of our new online games, which we believe is typically four to five years for successful online games or two to three years for most other online games, we need to continue to develop and release upgrades to our new online games. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify appropriate games or enter into arrangements with those game developers to offer these games in China on terms acceptable to us or at all, or that we can maintain the expected life span of our new online games. If we are not able to license, develop or acquire additional attractive online games with lasting appeal to users, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to recover our market share and profitability as we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against many companies. There are currently over 100 online game operators in China. We expect that, given the relatively low barriers to entry, more companies will enter the online game industry in China and a wider range of online games will be introduced to the Chinese market. Our competitors vary in size and include large companies, many of which have significantly greater financial, marketing and game development resources and name recognition than we have, such as Tencent Inc., Shanda Games Limited, Netease.com, Inc., Perfect World Co., Ltd., Changyou.com Limited and Giant Interactive Group. As a result, we may not be able to devote adequate resources to designing, developing or acquiring new games, undertaking extensive marketing campaigns, adopting aggressive pricing policies, paying high compensation to game developers or compensating independent game developers to the same degree as certain of our competitors do. Our competitors may introduce new business methods from time to time. If these new business methods turn to be more attractive to customers than the business methods we currently use, our customers may switch to our competitors games, and we may lose market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against new or existing competitors, or against new business methods implemented by them. In addition, the increasing competition we anticipate in the online game industry may also reduce the number of our users or the growth rate of our user base or reduce the game points spending for in-game premium. All of these competitive factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from recovering market share and profitability. 5 Table of Contents Illegal game servers, unauthorized character enhancements and other infringements of our intellectual property rights, as well as theft of in-game goods, could harm our business and reputation and materially and adversely affect our results of operation. With the increase in the number of online game players in China, we have faced the risks of illegal game servers, unauthorized character enhancements and other infringements of our intellectual property rights as well as the risk of theft of in-game goods purchased by our customers. Our historical results of operations were materially and adversely affected by illegal game servers. Although we have adopted a number of measures to address illegal server usage, misappropriation of our game server installation software and the establishment of illegal game servers could harm our business and reputation and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. From time to time, we have detected a number of players who have gained an unfair advantage by installing tools that fraudulently facilitate character progression. We have installed software patches designed to prevent unauthorized modifications to our execution files. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and eliminate new illegal game servers, unauthorized character enhancements or other infringements of our intellectual property rights in a timely manner, or at all. The deletion of unauthorized character enhancements requires the affected players to restart with a new character from the starting level, and this may cause some of these players to cease playing the game altogether. If we are unable to eliminate illegal servers, unauthorized character enhancements or suffer other infringement of our intellectual property rights, our players perception of the reliability of our games may be negatively impacted, which may reduce the number of players using our games, shorten the lifespan of our games and adversely affect our results of operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the downturn in the global or Chinese economy. The global financial markets experienced significant disruptions in 2008 and the effect of the crisis still persists. Chinas economy has also faced challenges. To the extent that there have been improvements in some areas, it is uncertain whether such recovery is sustainable. Since we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from China, our business and prospects may be affected by economic conditions in China. Moreover, a slowdown in the global or Chinese economy or the recurrence of any financial disruptions in any jurisdiction, such as European Union, may have a material and adverse impact on available financing. The weakness in the economy could erode investors confidence, which constitutes the basis of the equity markets. The recent financial turmoil affecting the financial markets and banking system may significantly restrict our ability to obtain financing in the capital markets or from financial institutions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We are uncertain about the extent to which the recent global financial and economic crisis and slowdown of the Chinese economy may impact our business in the long term. There is a risk that our business, results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected by the global economic downturn and the slowdown of the Chinese economy. We face the risks of changing consumer preferences and uncertainty about market acceptance of our new products. The online game industry is relatively new and constantly evolving in China. Customer demand for and market acceptance of our online games is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Our future operating results will depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include:  the popularity of new online games that we operate;  the introduction of new online games competing with or replacing our existing online games;  general economic conditions, particularly economic conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending;  changes in customer tastes and preferences;  the availability of other forms of entertainment;  critical reviews and public tastes and preferences, all of which change rapidly and cannot be predicted; and  customer demand for our in-game items. 6 Table of Contents Our ability to plan for product development and distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by our ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in consumer tastes and preferences. Currently, one of the most popular types of online games in China are MMORPGs. However, there is no assurance that MMORPGs will continue to be popular in China or that their popularity will not be surpassed by new and different types of online or other games in the future. For example, other types of online games, such as MMOFPS, web games, social games and mobile games have been gradually gaining popularity among game players since 2009. A decline in the popularity of online and mobile games in general or the MMORPGs that we operate will likely adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, we expect that as we introduce new MMORPGs, a certain portion of our existing customers will switch to the new games. If this transfer of players from our existing games exceeds our expectations, we may have to adjust our marketing, pricing and other business plans and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Future acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business and our results of operations. Selective acquisitions form a part of our strategy to further expand our business. For example, we acquired the majority interest in Red 5 Studios, Inc., or Red 5, to further strengthen our online game development capabilities. We believe that integration of a new companys operations and personnel into ours will require the significant attention of our management. The diversion of our managements attention away from our business and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. In addition, we have increasingly relied on our acquired subsidiaries to develop our own proprietary games. For example, Red 5 is developing Firefall, a MMOFPS game, which we expect to launch in 2012. If our acquired subsidiaries are unable to develop, launch and operate games that are commercially successful and appeal to game players, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We intend to selectively acquire companies, technologies and personnel that are complementary to our existing business. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions, investments or organic means will depend on the availability of suitable acquisitions and investment candidates at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract these candidates, and the availability of financing to complete large acquisitions. We may face significant competition in acquiring new businesses or companies, which may hinder the execution of our growth strategy. Future acquisitions or investments could result in a potential dilutive issuance of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, impairment losses or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The benefits of an acquisition or investment may also take considerable time to develop and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition or investment will produce its intended benefits. Future acquisitions would also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with the assimilation of new operations, technologies and personnel, unforeseen or hidden liabilities, the diversion of resources from our existing businesses, sites and technologies, the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions, and potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, customers, licensors and other suppliers as a result of the integration of new businesses. Future equity investments may have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. We expand our business in part through selective equity investments. To date, we have acquired equity interests in various online game developers, operators, and mobile game or application platforms. Equity investments create a unique problem in that we are often limited in our ability to manage the products and strategies of the companies in which we invest. The diversion of our managements attention away from our business and any difficulties encountered in managing our interests in the respective investees could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. In addition, we may not recover our equity investments if the companies in which we invest do not perform well and equity investments could result in the incurrence of impairment losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 7 Table of Contents Undetected programming errors or flaws in our games could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our games, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our games may contain errors or flaws, which may only be discovered after their release, particularly as we launch new games or introduce new features to existing games under tight time constraints. If our games contain programming errors or other flaws, our customers may be less inclined to continue playing our games or to recommend our games to other potential customers, and may switch to our competitors games. Undetected programming errors and game defects can disrupt our operations, adversely affect the gaming experience of our users, harm our reputation, cause our customers to stop playing our games, divert our resources and delay market acceptance of our games, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We may not be able to prevent others from infringing upon our intellectual property rights, which may harm our business and expose us to litigation. We regard our proprietary software, domain names, trade names, trademarks and similar intellectual properties as critical to our success. Intellectual property rights and confidentiality protection in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. Monitoring and preventing the unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive. The steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary technology. Any misappropriation could have a negative effect on our business and operating results. We may need to resort to court proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in the future. Litigation relating to our intellectual property might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention away from our business. See  Risks Related to Doing Business in China  Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. We may not be able to obtain additional financing to support our business and operation, and our equity or debt financings may have an adverse effect on our business operation and share price. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. We expect to incur more product development costs to develop our proprietary online games. With mobile social gaming platform being one of our new business directions, we expect to make significant investment to grow this business and expand our research and development team. If our internal financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek additional financing through the issuance of equity securities or through debt financing. Such financing may result in dilution to our existing shareholders interest or increase in our debt service obligations. Incurrence of additional indebtedness could also result in operating and financing covenants restricting our business operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such future financing will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure to maintain a stable and effective online payment system could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Online payment systems in China are developing fast and gaining more acceptance to consumers in China in recent years than before. We rely on our internally-developed online payment systems, Pass9 system, for sales of our online game services to consumers. Although our online payment systems are designed to support various third-party Internet payment channels in China, our online payment systems may be disrupted by system failure, programming errors, computer hackers or any failure or disruption from the Internet payment channels. See  Our business may be harmed if our technology becomes obsolete or if our system infrastructure fails to operate effectively. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain favorable relationships with the third-party Internet payment channels. If we fail to maintain a stable and favorable relationship with these channels, or otherwise fail to effectively maintain our online payment systems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any failure to maintain a stable and efficient distribution network could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We rely on a network of distributors throughout China for sales of our online game services, including our online game points, to our customers. As a result, a substantial portion of our sales are carried out via a distribution network composed of third-party distributors. Our national distributor sells its prepaid cards to over 20,000 local distributors and Internet cafés throughout China, which in turn sell the cards to end users. End users can purchase our online game points with the prepaid cards. Currently, Beijing HuiyuanNet Technology Co., Ltd. is our sole national distributor. We do not have long-term agreements with our distributor. A delay or failure by our distributor to successfully market these products may adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain favorable relationships with our distributor. If we fail to maintain a stable and efficient distribution network, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 8 Table of Contents We rely on services and licenses from third parties to carry out our businesses, and if there is any negative development in these services or licenses, our end users may cease to use our products and services. In addition to our online payment systems and distribution systems for which we significantly rely on third party services, we also rely on third-party services and licenses for our operations. For example, we rely on third party licenses for some of the software underlying our technology platform, and we rely on China Telecoms Internet data centers to host our servers. See Item 4. Information on the Company  B. Business Overview  Pricing, Distribution and Marketing. In addition, we expect to continue to derive a considerable amount of our revenues from our licensed online games in the near term. Any interruption or any other negative development in our ability to rely on these services and licenses, such as material deterioration of quality of the third party services or the loss of intellectual property relating to the license held by our licensors, could have a material and adverse impact on our business operations. In particular, our game licensors may be subject to intellectual property rights claims with respect to the games or software licensed to us. If such licensors cannot prevail on the legal proceedings brought against them, we could lose the right to use the licensed games or software. Furthermore, if our arrangements with any of these third parties are terminated or modified against our interest, we may not be able to find alternative solutions on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us. If any of these events occur, our end users may cease using our products and services, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Unexpected network interruptions caused by system failures or other internal or external factors may lead to user attrition, revenue reductions and may harm our reputation. Any failure to maintain satisfactory performances, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure may cause significant harm to our reputation and our ability to attract and maintain users. The system hardware for our operations is located in several cities in China. We maintain our backup system hardware and operate our back-end infrastructure in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Nanjing, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Nantong and Hong Kong. Server interruptions, breakdowns or system failures in the cities where we maintain our servers and system hardware, including failures that may be attributable to sustained power shutdowns, or other events within or outside our control that could result in a sustained shutdown of all or a material portion of our services, could adversely impact our ability to service our users. Our network systems are also vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer hacking and similar events. We maintain property insurance policies covering our servers, but do not have business interruption insurance. Our business may be harmed if our technology becomes obsolete or if our system infrastructure fails to operate effectively. The online game industry is subject to rapid technological change. We need to anticipate the emergence of new technologies and games, assess their acceptance and make appropriate investments. If we are unable to do so, new technologies in online game programming or operations could render our games obsolete or unattractive. We use our internally developed Pass9 system and other software systems that support nearly all aspects of our billing and payment transactions. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to upgrade our systems fast enough to accommodate future traffic levels, avoid obsolescence or successfully integrate any newly developed or acquired technology with our existing systems. Capacity constraints could cause unanticipated system disruptions and slower response times, affecting data transmission and game play. These factors could, among other things, cause us to lose existing or potential customers and existing or potential game development partners. 9 Table of Contents We have been and may be subject to future intellectual property rights claims or other claims, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our financial and management resources away from our business. There is no assurance that our online games or other content posted on our websites or our mobile games do not or will not infringe upon patents, valid copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others. In addition, some of our employees were previously employed at other companies, including our current and potential competitors. We also intend to hire additional personnel to expand our product development and technical support teams. To the extent these employees have been involved in research at our company similar to research in which they have been involved at their former employers, we may become subject to claims that such employees have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. In addition, our competitors may file lawsuits against us in order to gain an unfair competitive advantage over us. In February 2010, Beijing Superior Court issued a judgment against us in a lawsuit filed by Beijing Founder Electronics Co., Ltd., which ruled that WoW client installation packages sold by us in 2007 contained fonts that infringed Beijing Founder Electronics Co., Ltd.s intellectual property rights. Based on the judgment, we are required to compensate Beijing Founder Electronics Co., Ltd. an aggregate amount of RMB1,570,000 (US$249,500). We have appealed the judgment and the case is pending as the date of this annual report. If any such claim arises in the future, litigation or other dispute resolution proceedings may be necessary to retain our ability to offer our current and future games, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our financial and management resources. Furthermore, if we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, incur additional costs to license or develop alternative games and be forced to pay fines and damages, each of which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations in operating results depend on a variety of factors, including the timing of new game launches and the expiration of existing game licenses. Other factors include the demand for our products and the products of our competitors, the level of usage of illegal game servers, the level of usage of the Internet, the size and rate of growth of the online game market and development and promotional expenses related to the introduction of new products. In addition, because our game software is susceptible to unauthorized character enhancements, we may periodically delete characters that are enhanced with unauthorized modifications. This has caused some affected customers to stop playing the respective game, which, in the aggregate, may cause our operating results to fluctuate. To a significant degree, our operating expenses are based on planned expenditures and our expectations regarding prospective customer usage. Failure to meet our expectations could disproportionately and adversely affect our operating results in any given quarter. As a result, we believe that our historical operating results may not necessarily be indicative of our future results. Our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services. Our future success depends heavily upon the continued services of our senior executives. We rely on their expertise in business operations, technology support and sales and marketing and on their relationships with our shareholders and distributors. We do not maintain key-man life insurance for any of our key executives. If one or more of our key executives are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all. As a result, our business may be severely disrupted, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we may incur additional expense to recruit and train personnel. Each of our executive officers has entered into an employment agreement with us, which contain confidentiality and non-competition provisions. If any disputes arise between our executive officers and us, we cannot assure you the extent to which any of these agreements could be enforced in China, where these executive officers reside and hold most of their assets, in light of uncertainties with the PRC legal system. See   Risks Related to Doing Business in China  Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. 10 Table of Contents If we are unable to attract, train and retain key individuals and highly skilled employees, our business may be adversely affected. As our business expands, we need to hire and retain additional qualified employees, including skilled and experienced online game developers. Since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we may need to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to retain key personnel in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain the qualified game developers or other key personnel that we will need to achieve our business objectives. PRC laws and regulations restrict foreign ownership of Internet content provision, Internet culture operation and Internet publishing licenses, and substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the application and implementation of PRC laws and regulations. We are a Cayman Islands company and, as such, we are classified as a foreign enterprise under PRC laws. Various regulations in China currently restrict foreign or foreign-owned entities from holding certain licenses required in China to provide online game operation services over the Internet, including Internet content provision, or ICP, Internet culture operation and Internet publishing licenses. In light of such restrictions, we rely on Shanghai IT, our affiliated PRC entity, to hold and maintain the licenses necessary for the operation of our online games in China. In July 2006, the Ministry of Information Industry (which has subsequently been reorganized as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology), or MIIT, issued a notice, or the New MII Notice, which prohibits ICP license holders from leasing, transferring or selling a telecommunications business operating license to foreign investors in any form, or providing resources, sites or facilities to any foreign investors for their illegal operation of a telecommunications business in China. The notice also requires that ICP license holders and their shareholders directly own the domain names and trademarks used by such ICP license holders in their daily operations. The notice further requires each ICP license holder to have the necessary facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunication service providers are required to maintain network and information security in accordance with the standards set forth under relevant PRC regulations. The local authorities in charge of telecommunications services are required to ensure that existing ICP license holders conduct a self-assessment of their compliance with the New MII Notice and submit status reports to MIIT before November 1, 2006. Since the New MII Notice was issued, we have transferred to Shanghai IT all of the domain names used in our daily operations and certain trademarks used in our daily operations, as required under the New MII Notice. All relevant transfers have been completed and relevant approvals have been obtained. In September 2009, the General Administration of Press and Publication, or GAPP, promulgated the Circular Regarding the Implementation of the Department Reorganization Regulation by State Council and Relevant Interpretation by State Commission Office for Public Sector Reform to Further Strengthen the Administration of Pre-approval on Online Games and Approval on Import Online Games, or the GAPP Circular, which provides that foreign investors shall not control or participate in PRC online game operation businesses indirectly or in a disguised manner by establishing joint venture companies or entering into relevant agreements with, or by providing technical supports to, such PRC online game operation companies, or by inputting the users registration, account management or game card consumption directly into the interconnected gaming platform or fighting platform controlled or owned by the foreign investor. It is not clear whether the regulatory authority of GAPP applies to the regulation of ownership structures of online game companies based in China and online game operation in China. Other government agencies that have regulatory jurisdiction over the online game operations in China, such as the MOC and MIIT, did not join GAPP in issuing the GAPP Circular. To date, the GAPP has not issued any interpretation of the GAPP Circular. It is not yet clear how this GAPP Circular will be implemented. If we or Shanghai IT are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, including the New MII Notice and the GAPP Circular, the relevant governmental authorities, according to the nature of the violation, would have broad discretion to adopt one or more of the following measures against us, including levying fines, confiscating our income or the income of Shanghai IT, revoking our business licenses or the business license and/or other licenses of Shanghai IT, requiring us and Shanghai IT to restructure our ownership structure or operations, and requiring us or Shanghai IT to discontinue any portion or all of our operations related to online games. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations. 11 Table of Contents Subject to the interpretation and implementation of the GAPP Circular, the ownership structure and the business operation models of our PRC subsidiaries and affiliated PRC entities comply with all applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and no consent, approval or license is required under any of the existing laws and regulations of China for their ownership structure and business operation models except for those which we have already obtained or which would not have a material adverse effect on our business or operations as a whole. There are, however, substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and regulations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that PRC government authorities will ultimately take a view that is consistent with the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. For example, the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, promulgated the Rules of Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System of Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors in August 2011, or the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, to implement the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated on February 3, 2011, or Circular No. 6. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules came into effect on September 1, 2011 and replaced the Interim Provisions of the Ministry of Commerce on Matters Relating to the Implementation of the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated by MOFCOM in March 2011. According to these circulars and rules, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having national defense and security concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire the de facto control of domestic enterprises having national security concerns. In addition, when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a domestic enterprise by foreign investors is subject to the security review, MOFCOM will look into the substance and actual impact of the transaction. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules further prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. There is no explicit provision or official interpretation stating that our online game operation services falls into the scope subject to the security review, and there is no requirement for foreign investors in those merger and acquisition transactions already completed prior to the promulgation of Circular No. 6 to submit such transactions to MOFCOM for security review. As we have already obtained the de facto control over our affiliated PRC entities prior to the effectiveness of these circulars and rules, we do not believe we are required to submit our existing contractual arrangement to MOFCOM for security review. However, we are advised by our PRC legal counsel that, as these circulars and rules are relatively new and as there is a lack of clear statutory interpretation on the implementation of the same, there is no assurance that MOFCOM will have the same view as we do when applying these national security review-related circulars and rules. We could also face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that our contractual arrangements with Shanghai IT were not made on reasonable commercial terms or otherwise. If this were to occur, they may adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could result in a reduction, for PRC tax purposes, of costs and expenses recorded by Shanghai IT, which could adversely affect us by: (i) increasing Shanghai ITs tax liability without reducing our PRC subsidiaries tax liability, which could further result in late payment fees and other penalties to Shanghai IT for underpaid taxes; or (ii) limiting Shanghai ITs ability to maintain preferential tax treatments and other financial incentives. We may not be able to get approval for renewing our current foreign games, or for licensing new foreign games, if the PRC regulatory authorities promote a policy of domestic online or mobile game development and tighten approval criteria for online or mobile game imports. Our business depends heavily on licensing and operating foreign games and will continue to do so in the near future. In the past, such foreign games mainly included MMORPGs or casual games. With mobile social gaming being one of our new businesses, our business will also depend on licensing foreign mobile games. Since 2004, relevant government authorities have promulgated several circulars, according to which the development of domestically developed online games, including mobile games, will be strategically supported by the PRC government. For example, in July 2005, MIIT and the Ministry of Culture issued the Opinion on Development and Management of Online Games, or the Opinion. The Opinion provided that domestic software development companies, network service providers and content providers will be encouraged, guided and supported to develop and promote self-developed and self-owned online games so that such games can take up a leading position in the domestic market and expand into the international market. 12 Table of Contents The government will also encourage the development of derivative products to domestic online games. In support of this policy, GAPP may tighten approval criteria for online game imports in an effort to protect the development of domestic online game enterprises, as well as to limit the influence of foreign culture on Chinese youth. If GAPP implements such rules and policies, we may not be able to get approval for renewing our current foreign game licenses or for licensing new foreign games, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Failure to obtain or renew approvals or filings for online games and mobile games we operate may adversely affect our operations or subject us to penalties. The Ministry of Culture has promulgated laws and regulations that require, among other things, (i) the review and prior approval of all new online games licensed from foreign game developers and related license agreements, (ii) the review of patches and updates with substantial changes of games which have already been approved, and (iii) the filing of domestically developed online games. Furthermore, online games, regardless of whether imported or domestic, will be subject to content review and approval by GAPP prior to the commencement of games operations in China. Failure to obtain or renew approvals or complete filings for online games or mobile games may materially delay or otherwise affect a game operators plan to launch new games, and the operator may be subject to fines, the restriction or suspension of operations of the related games or revocation of licenses in the event that the relevant governmental authority believes that the violation is severe. We obtained the necessary approvals from, and completed the necessary filings with, the Ministry of Culture and GAPP for operations of Soul of The Ultimate Nation, or SUN, Atlantica, World of Fighter, Kingdom Heroes 2 Online, Seoyugi, Q Jiang San Guo and Winning Goal in China. We also obtained the necessary approvals from GAPP for operating ShenXianZhuan and Era Zero. Consistent with the general practice of the mobile game industry in China, we have not yet completed filings with the Ministry of Culture and GAPP for our mobile games before we commenced our mobile game operations. From time to time, we also rely on certain third party licensors of domestically developed online games to obtain approvals and complete filings with the PRC regulatory authorities. If such third party licensors fail to obtain the required approvals or complete the filings, we may not be able to continue the operation of such games. If any such negative event occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We depend on Shanghai IT to hold certain operating licenses. If Shanghai IT or its shareholders violate our contractual arrangements, our business could be disrupted and our reputation may be harmed. Because the PRC government restricts our ownership of ICP, Internet culture operation and Internet publishing businesses in China, we depend on Shanghai IT, our affiliated PRC entity in which we have no ownership interest, to hold and maintain certain licenses necessary for our business operations. Our relationship with Shanghai IT is governed by a series of contractual arrangements that are intended to provide us with effective control over these entities, but these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control as direct ownership of these businesses. For example, Shanghai IT or its shareholders could violate their contractual arrangement with us, or otherwise become unable to perform its contracts with us. As a result, we may lose the licenses required for our online game operations and our reputation and business could be harmed. The principal shareholders of our affiliated PRC entities have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may adversely affect our business. We have two affiliated PRC entities, namely Shanghai IT and Huopu Cloud. Yong Wang, our vice president, and Wei Ji, one of our employees, are the principal shareholders of Shanghai IT. Our senior legal director, Junping Han, and finance director, Wei Xiong, are the principal shareholders of Huopu Cloud. Thus, there may be conflicts of interest between their respective duties to our company as management and employees and their respective shareholder interests in these affiliated PRC entities. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, these persons will act in our best interests or that conflicts of interests will be resolved in our favor. These persons could violate their legal duties, including duties under their non-competition or employment agreements with us, by engaging in activities that are not in the best interest in our company, such as diverting business opportunities from us. In any such event, we would have to rely on the PRC legal system to enforce these agreements. Any legal proceeding could result in the disruption of our business, diversion of our resources and the incurrence of substantial costs. See  Risks Related to Doing Business in China  Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. 13 Table of Contents Our subsidiaries in China are subject to restrictions on paying dividends or making other payments. From time to time, we may rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries in China to fund our operations, such as paying dividends to our shareholders or meeting obligations under any indebtedness incurred by us or our overseas subsidiaries. Current PRC regulations restrict our subsidiaries in China from paying dividends in the following two principal aspects: (i) our subsidiaries in China are only permitted to pay dividends out of their respective after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations, and (ii) these entities are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund statutory reserve funds until the cumulative total of the allocated reserves reaches 50% of registered capital, and a portion of their respective after-tax profits to their staff welfare and bonus reserve funds as determined by their respective boards of directors or shareholders. These reserves are not distributable as dividends. See Item 4. Information on the Company  B. Business Overview  Government Regulations. Further, if these entities incur debt on their behalf in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. Our inability to receive dividends or other payments from our PRC subsidiaries may adversely affect our ability to continue to grow our business and make cash or other distributions to the holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs. In addition, failure to comply with relevant State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, regulations may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments to us. See  Risks Related to Doing Business in China  PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident shareholders or us to penalties and fines, and limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries ability to increase their registered capital, distribute profits to us, or otherwise adversely affect us. We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategies. Our objective is to become a leading developer and operator of multi-platform games in China. In order to achieve this objective, we are primarily focusing on developing proprietary games and obtaining licenses to games. We plan to further enhance our game development capability and the diversity of our game portfolio and pipeline through selective game studio acquisitions primarily in the U.S. and in China. We also plan to operate our proprietary games in selected overseas market. Since 2010, we have invested in developing our mobile game business. We plan to primarily use licensed mobile social gaming platform software and licensed mobile games from other developers in the near future. We expect to rely on OpenFeint Inc., or OpenFeint, for the license of our mobile social gaming platform software, and our business partners include mobile game developers, telecom carriers and cell phone manufacturers. Our business strategies may involve the development and marketing of new services and products for which there are no established markets in China or in which we lack experience and expertise. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to deliver new products or services on a commercially viable basis or in a timely manner, or at all, or that we will be able to successfully implement our other growth strategies. If any of these occur, our competitiveness may be harmed and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We could be liable for breaches of security on our websites and fraudulent transactions by users of our websites. Currently, a portion of our transactions are conducted through our websites. In such transactions, secured transmission of confidential information (such as customers credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information and billing addresses) over public networks is essential to maintain consumer confidence. Our current security measures may not be adequate to safeguard against fraudulent transactions. Security breaches could expose us to litigation and possible liability for failing to secure confidential customer information and could harm our reputation and ability to attract customers. Existing major shareholders have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control. Incsight Limited, or Incsight, a company wholly-owned by Jun Zhu, our chairman and chief executive officer, and Bosma Limited, or Bosma, the two largest shareholders of our company, collectively own a significant percentage of our outstanding ordinary shares. Incsight and Bosma have entered into a voting agreement to vote together with respect to the election of our directors. See Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  C. Board Practices  Voting Agreement. As a result, these shareholders will continue to exert significant control over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including but not limited to, the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other shareholders may desire. In addition, the rights of minority shareholders and the fiduciary obligations of directors and majority shareholders in the Cayman Islands may not be as extensive as those in the United States or elsewhere, and the ability to assert shareholder rights may be comparatively limited. 14 Table of Contents New income tax laws may increase our tax burden or the tax burden on the holders of our shares or ADSs, and tax benefits available to us may be reduced or repealed, causing the value of your investment in us to suffer. Our subsidiaries and affiliated entities in the PRC are subject to enterprise income tax, or EIT, on the taxable income as reported in their respective statutory financial statements adjusted in accordance with the Corporate Income Tax Law of the Peoples Republic of China, or CIT Law, which was approved by the National Peoples Congress on March 16, 2007. The CIT Law went into effect as of January 1, 2008, which unified the tax rate generally applicable to both domestic and foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC. Our subsidiaries and affiliated entities in the PRC are generally subject to EIT at a statutory rate of 25%. However, some subsidiaries that are located in the Pudong New District of Shanghai and were established before March 2007 currently enjoy five-year transitional EIT rates, which equate to phase-in rates of 18%, 20%, 22%, 24% and 25% for the five years from 2008 to 2012 according to local practice. Our subsidiaries and affiliated entities that hold a High and New Technology Enterprise, or HNTE, qualification are entitled to enjoy a 15% preferential EIT rate. In April 2007, China The9 Interactive (Beijing) Limited, or C9I Beijing, received approval from governmental authorities to be classified as a HNTE. This classification allowed C9I Beijing to enjoy an EIT exemption for 2007-2009, and a 50% reduction of the statutory rate in 2010-2012. In addition, Shanghai IT also applied and received approval from government authorities to be classified as a HNTE. This approval allowed Shanghai IT to enjoy a 15% preferential EIT rate for 20082010. However, in April 2008, government authorities announced the new implementation rules for application and assessment of HNTEs. Each qualified HNTE needs to re-apply for this qualification according to the new implementation rules. In particular, the HNTE qualification is generally valid for a term of three years after the issuance of the approval certificate, and the enterprise is required to apply for re-examination before the end of the term. As a result, C9I Beijing reapplied and received approvals for the HNTE qualification and related preferential tax rates during the period of 2008-2010 from the government authorities. In addition, in October 2011, Shanghai IT reapplied for the HNTE qualification and received approval from the governmental authorities. It has applied with the local tax authorities for the approval of the 15% preferential EIT rate for 2011-2013 and we expect to obtain such approval in 2012. However, we cannot assure you that our PRC subsidiaries or affiliated entities will meet these criteria and continue to be qualified as HNTEs by the tax authorities in the future. Moreover, unlike the tax regulations effective before 2008, which specifically exempted withholding taxes on dividends payable to non-PRC investors from foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC, the CIT Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding income tax rate of 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of other countries or regions. While the Tax Agreement between the PRC and Hong Kong provides dividends paid by a foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC to its corporate shareholder, which is considered a Hong Kong tax resident, will be subject to withholding tax at the rate of 5% of total dividends, this is limited to instances where the corporate shareholder directly holds at least 25% of the shares of the company that is to pay dividends for at least twelve consecutive months immediately prior to receiving the dividends and meets certain other criteria prescribed by the relevant regulations. Entitlement to a lower tax rate on dividends according to tax treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions is further subject to approval of the relevant tax authority. Furthermore, the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, promulgated the Notice on How to Understand and Determine the Beneficial Owners in Tax Agreement in October 2009, or Circular 601, which provides guidance for determining whether a resident of a contracting state is the beneficial owner of an item of income under Chinas tax treaties and tax arrangements. According to Circular 601, a beneficial owner generally must be engaged in substantive business activities. An agent or conduit company will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and, therefore, will not be qualified for treaty benefits. A conduit company normally refers to a company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits. We cannot assure you that any dividends to be distributed by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our non-PRC shareholders and ADS holders, whose jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China providing a different withholding arrangement, will be entitled to the benefits under the relevant withholding arrangement. 15 Table of Contents In addition, the CIT Law deems an enterprise established offshore but having its management organ in the PRC as a resident enterprise that will be subject to PRC tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. Under the Implementation Rules of the CIT Law, the term management organ is defined as an organ which has substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operation, personnel, accounting, properties and other factors. On April 22, 2009, the SAT further issued a notice regarding recognizing an offshore-established enterprise controlled by PRC shareholders as a resident enterprise according to its management organ. According to this notice, a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group shall be deemed a PRC resident enterprise, if (i) the senior management and the core management departments in charge of its daily operations are mainly located and function in the PRC; (ii) its financial decisions and human resource decisions are subject to the determination or approval of persons or institutions located in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, minutes and files of board meetings and shareholders meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) more than half of the directors or senior management with voting rights reside in the PRC. Although our offshore companies are not controlled by any PRC company or PRC company group, we cannot assure you that we will not be deemed to be a resident enterprise under the CIT Law and thus be subject to PRC EIT on our global income. According to the CIT Law and its implementation rules, dividends are exempted from income tax if such dividends are received by a resident enterprise on equity interests it directly owns in another resident enterprise. However, foreign corporate holders of our shares or ADSs may be subject to taxation at a rate of 10% on any dividends received from us or any gains realized from the transfer of our shares or ADSs if we are deemed to be a resident enterprise or if such income is otherwise regarded as income from sources within the PRC. The CIT Law empowers the PRC State Council to enact appropriate implementing rules and measures and there is no guarantee that we or our subsidiaries will be entitled to any of the preferential tax treatments. Nor can we assure you that the tax authorities will not, in the future, discontinue any of our preferential tax treatments, potentially with retroactive effect. Any significant increase in the EIT rate under the CIT Law applicable to our PRC subsidiaries and affiliated entities, or the imposition of withholding taxes on dividends payable by our subsidiaries to us, or an EIT levy on us or any of our subsidiaries or affiliated entities registered outside the PRC, or dividends or capital gains received by our shareholders due to shares or ADSs held in us will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial conditions and the value of investments in us. We are required to pay value added tax as a result of recent tax reform in Shanghai, and we may be subject to similar tax treatments elsewhere in China. On November 16, 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the SAT jointly issued the Circular on the Pilot Program for the Collection of Value Added Tax Instead of Business Tax, or Circular 110, and the Circular on the Pilot Program for the Collection of Value Added Tax Instead of Business Tax in the Transportation and Certain Modern Service Sectors in Shanghai, or Circular 111, which became effective on January 1, 2012. Pursuant to Circular 110 and Circular 111, a tax reform pilot program came into effect in Shanghai, which was chosen by the PRC government as the first pilot city for such reform. Starting from January 1, 2012, companies which are designated by Shanghai local tax authorities as operating in certain modern service sectors are required to pay value added tax, or VAT, in lieu of business tax. As a result of the pilot program, some of our services provided by Shanghai IT are subject to VAT at the rate of 6%. Shanghai IT, as a General VAT Payer under the applicable tax regulations, may reduce its VAT payable amount by the VAT which it has paid in connection with its purchasing activities, or its Input VAT. All services provided by Shanghai Jiucheng Advertisement, Jiutuo (Shanghai) Information Technology Co., Ltd. and Huopu Cloud shall be subject to VAT at the rate of 3%, and these companies as Small-scale VAT Payers under the applicable tax regulations may not reduce their VAT payable by their Input VAT. Circular 110 and Circular 111 are newly introduced and there is significant uncertainty relating to the interpretation and enforcement of such circulars by national and Shanghai local tax authorities and other relevant authorities. In addition, such tax reform, in the form of pilot programs or otherwise, may be extended to other regions in which we operate. As a result, we may be subject to more unfavorable tax treatment with respect to our business operations as a result of the VAT reform, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 16 Table of Contents Strengthened scrutiny over acquisition transactions by the PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on our acquisition strategy. In connection with the CIT Law, the Ministry of Finance and SAT jointly issued, on April 30, 2009, the Notice on Issues Concerning Process of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise Restructuring Business, or Circular 59. On December 10, 2009, the SAT issued the Notice on Strengthening the Management on Enterprise Income Tax for Non-resident Enterprises Equity Transfer, or Circular 698. Both Circular 59 and Circular 698 became effective retroactively on January 1, 2008. Under the two circulars, non-PRC-resident enterprises may be subject to income tax on capital gains generated from their transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises. The PRC tax authorities have the discretion under Circular 59 and Circular 698 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the equity interests transferred and the cost of the investment. In addition, by promulgating and implementing the circulars, the PRC tax authorities have strengthened their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-PRC-resident enterprise. For example, Circular 698 specifies that the PRC SAT is entitled to redefine the nature of an equity transfer where offshore vehicles are interposed for tax-avoidance purposes and without reasonable commercial purpose. Since we pursue acquisitions as one of our growth strategies, and have conducted and may conduct acquisitions involving complex corporate structures, the PRC tax authorities may, at their discretion, adjust the capital gains or request us to submit additional documentation for their review in connection with any of our acquisitions, thus causing us to incur additional acquisition costs. We have adopted a shareholders rights plan, which, together with the other anti-takeover provisions of our articles of association, could discourage a third party from acquiring us, which could limit our shareholders opportunity to sell their shares, including ordinary shares represented by our ADSs, at a premium. On January 8, 2009, our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan. Under the rights plan, one right was distributed with respect to each of our ordinary shares outstanding at the close of business on January 22, 2009. In the event that, subject to limited exceptions, a person or group obtains beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our voting securities (including by acquisition of our ADSs representing ordinary shares), or enters into an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors, such person or group will become the acquiring person under the plan. As a result, these rights will entitle the holders, other than the acquiring person, to purchase upon the exercise of such right the number of our ordinary shares having a market value of two times the then current purchase price associated with the right. For example, at a purchase price of $14.50 per right, each right not owned by an acquiring person would entitle its holder to purchase $29.00 worth of our ordinary shares for $14.50. This rights plan and the other anti-takeover provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. Our existing authorized ordinary shares confer on the holders of our ordinary shares equal rights, privileges and restrictions. The shareholders have, by virtue of adoption of our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, authorized the issuance of shares of par value of US$0.01 each without specifying any special rights, privileges and restrictions. Therefore, our board of directors may, without further action by our shareholders, issue ordinary shares, or issue shares of such class and attach to such shares special rights, privileges or restrictions, which may be different from those associated with our ordinary shares. Preferred shares could also be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue ordinary shares or preferred shares, the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. We have limited business insurance coverage in China. The insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. As a result, we do not have any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster might result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of our resources. 17 Table of Contents Some of our subsidiaries and affiliated entities in China engaged in certain business activities beyond the authorized scope of their respective licenses, and if they are subject to administrative penalties or fines, our operating results may be adversely affected. Some of our subsidiaries and affiliated entities in China engaged in business activities that were not within the authorized scope of their respective licenses. Shanghai ITs current ICP license, which is requisite for its online gaming business, was issued on May 4, 2010, and is effective until May 4, 2015. Although Shanghai ITs current main business is online games, it provides an ancillary bulletin board service which is mainly used for communications among online game players and does not affect the operations of Shanghai IT. Shanghai IT has not obtained approval for the license for bulletin board services. The relevant PRC authorities have the authority to impose administrative fines or other penalties for violations, which may in turn adversely affect our operating results. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and the trading price of our ADSs. We are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management in its annual report that contains managements assessment of the effectiveness of such companys internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, beginning with the year ended December 31, 2007, we have been required to receive an independent registered public accounting firms report on the effectiveness of our companys internal controls over financial reporting. Our management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective as of December 31, 2011. However, if we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level. This could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial conditions which in turn could negatively impact the trading price of our ADSs and result in lawsuits being filed against us by our shareholders or otherwise harm our reputation. Furthermore, we have incurred and anticipate that we will continue to incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We face risks related to health epidemics and other natural disasters. Our business could be adversely affected by H1N1, or swine influenza, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, or another epidemic or outbreak. An outbreak of swine influenza in Mexico in the summer of 2009 spread to China and there have been confirmed cases of swine influenza in China. Any prolonged recurrence of swine influenza, avian flu, SARS or other adverse public health developments in China may have a material adverse effect on our business operations. Our operations may be impacted by a number of health-related factors, including, among other things, quarantines or closures of our offices which could severely disrupt our operations, the sickness or death of our key officers and employees and closure of Internet cafés and other public areas where people access the Internet. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future outbreak of swine influenza, avian flu, SARS or any other epidemic. In addition, other major natural disasters may also adversely affect our business by, for example, causing disruptions of the Internet network or otherwise affecting access to our games, or resulting in damages to our facilities. Risks Related to Doing Business in China Our business may be adversely affected by public opinion and government policies in China. Currently, most of our recurring users are young males, including students. Due to the higher degree of user loyalty to MMORPGs, easy access to PCs and Internet cafés, and lack of more appealing forms of entertainment in China, many teenagers frequently play online games. This may result in these teenagers spending less time on, or refraining from, other activities, including education and sports. Internet cafés, which are currently the most important outlets for online games, have been criticized by the general public in China as exerting a negative influence on young people. Due primarily to such adverse public reaction, some local governments in China have tightened their regulation of Internet café operations through, among other things, limiting the number of new operating licenses issued and further reducing the hours during which Internet cafés are permitted to be open for business. 18 Table of Contents Also, local and higher-level governmental authorities may from time to time decide to more strictly enforce the customers age limit and other requirements relating to Internet cafés as a result of the occurrence of, and the media attention on, gang fights, arson or other incidents in or related to Internet cafés. As a significant portion of our customers access our games from Internet cafés, any restrictions placed on Internet café operations could result in a reduction of the amount of time our customers spend on our online games or a reduction or slowdown in the growth of our customer base, thus adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In April 2007, various governmental authorities, including GAPP, MIIT, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Security, and other relevant authorities jointly issued a circular concerning the mandatory implementation of an anti-fatigue system in online games, which aims to protect the physical and psychological health of minors. This circular required all online games to incorporate an anti-fatigue system and an identity verification system, both of which have limited the amount of time that a minor or other user may continuously spend playing an online game. We have implemented such anti-fatigue and identification systems on all of our online games as required. Since March 2011, various governmental authorities, including MIIT, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Security, and other relevant authorities have jointly launched the Online Game Parents Guardianship Project for Minors, which allows parents to require online game operators to take relevant measures to limit the time spent by the minors playing online games and the minors access to their online game accounts. Further strengthening of these systems, or enactment by the PRC government of any additional laws to further tighten its administration over the Internet and online games or its supervision of Internet cafés may result in less time spent by customers or fewer customers playing our online games, which may materially and adversely affect our business results and prospects for future growth. Adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business. We conduct substantially all of our business operations in China. As the gaming industry is highly sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending, it tends to decline during general economic downturns. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in China. Chinas economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past twenty years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of China. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. While some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, they may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. As the PRC economy is increasingly intricately linked to the global economy, it is affected in various respects by downturns and recessions of major economies around the world, such as the recent financial services and economic crises of these economies. The various economic and policy measures the PRC government enacts to forestall economic downturns or shore up the PRC economy could affect our business. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although the PRC government has implemented measures since the late 1970s emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China are still owned by the PRC government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Since late 2003, the PRC government implemented a number of measures, such as raising interest rates and bank reserve requirements to place additional limitations on the ability of commercial banks to make loans, in order to contain the growth of specific segments of Chinas economy that it believed to be overheating. These actions, as well as future actions and policies of the PRC government, could materially affect our liquidity and access to capital and our ability to operate our business. 19 Table of Contents The laws and regulations governing the online game industry in China are developing and subject to future changes. If we fail to obtain or maintain all applicable permits and approvals, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected. The online game industry in China is highly regulated by the PRC government. Various regulatory authorities of the PRC central government, such as the State Council, MIIT, GAPP, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Public Security, are empowered to issue and implement regulations governing various aspects of the online games industry. We are required to obtain applicable permits or approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to provide online games to our customers. For example, an Internet content provider must obtain an ICP license in order to engage in any commercial ICP operations within China. In addition, an online games operator must also obtain a license from the Ministry of Culture and a license from GAPP in order to distribute games through the Internet. Furthermore, an online game operator is required to obtain approval from the Ministry of Culture in order to distribute virtual currencies for online games such as prepaid value cards, prepaid money or game points. If we fail to maintain any of these required permits or approvals, we may be subject to various penalties, including fines and the discontinuation or restriction of our operations. Any such disruption in our business operations would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As the online games industry is at an early stage of development in China, new laws and regulations may be adopted from time to time to require additional licenses and permits other than those we currently have, and may address new issues that arise from time to time. For example, a new rule issued in June 2009 requires existing online game operators, such as our company, to obtain additional approval from the Ministry of Culture for the issuance of virtual currencies to users for online game services within three months. We obtained the approval on November 20, 2009. As a result, substantial uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of current and any future PRC laws and regulations applicable to the online gaming industry. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely obtain any new license required in the future, or at all. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect, we cannot assure you that we will not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws and regulations. Intensified government regulation of Internet cafés could limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and expand our customer base. In April 2001, the PRC government began tightening its supervision of Internet cafés, closing down unlicensed Internet cafés, and required those remaining open to install software to prevent access to sites deemed subversive and required web portals to sign a pledge not to host subversive sites. Furthermore, the PRC governments policy, which encourages the development of a limited number of national and regional Internet café chains and discourages the establishment of independent Internet cafés, may slow the overall growth of Internet cafés. Currently, the issuance of Internet café licenses is subject to the overall planning of the Ministry of Culture and the local governments in respect of the total number and location of Internet cafés. Since 2004, the grant of new Internet café licenses has been suspended from time to time, and was again suspended in 2007. We have not been expressly notified of any suspensions in 2011, but the PRC government maintains strict controls on the granting of new licenses. As Internet cafés are the primary venue for users to play our games, any reduction in the number, or any slowdown in the growth of, Internet cafés in China will limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and expand our customer base, which will in turn materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the Internet in China may adversely affect our business, and we may be liable for information displayed on, retrieved from, or linked to our Internet websites. The PRC government has adopted certain regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of news and other information over the Internet. Under these regulations, Internet content providers and Internet publishers are prohibited from posting or displaying over the Internet content that, among other things, violates PRC laws and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China, or is obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the revocation of ICP and other required licenses and the closure of the concerned websites. The website operator may also be held liable for such prohibited information displayed on, retrieved from or linked to such website. 20 Table of Contents The Ministry of Culture has promulgated laws and regulations that reiterate the governments policies to prohibit the distribution of games with violence, cruelty or other elements that are believed to have the potential effect of instigating crimes, and to prevent the influx of harmful cultural products from overseas. The Ministry of Culture has promulgated laws and regulations that require, among other things, (i) the review and prior approval of (i) all new online games licensed from foreign game developers and related license agreements, (ii) the review of patches and updates with substantial changes of games which have already been approved, and (iii) the filing of domestically developed online games. Furthermore, online games, regardless of whether imported or domestic, will be subject to content review and approval by GAPP prior to the commencement of games operations in China. Failure to obtain or renew approvals or to complete filings for online games or mobile games may materially delay or otherwise affect game operators plans to launch new games, and the operator may be subject to fines, restriction or suspension of operations of the related games or revocation of licenses in the event that the relevant governmental authority believes that the violation is severe. We obtained the necessary approvals from and completed necessary filings with the Ministry of Culture and GAPP for operations of SUN, Atlantica, World of Fighter, Kingdom Heroes 2 Online, Seoyugi, Q Jiang San Guo and Winning Goal in China. We also obtained the necessary approvals from GAPP for operating ShenXianZhuan and Era Zero. Consistent with the general practice of the mobile game industry in China, we have not yet completed filings with the Ministry of Culture and GAPP for our mobile games before we commenced our mobile game operations. If any such negative event occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, MIIT has published regulations that subject website operators to potential liability for content included on their websites and the actions of users and others using their websites, including liability for violations of PRC laws prohibiting the dissemination of content deemed to be socially destabilizing. The Ministry of Public Security has the authority to order any local Internet service provider to block any Internet website maintained outside China at its sole discretion. Periodically, the Ministry of Public Security has stopped the dissemination over the Internet of information which it believes to be socially destabilizing. The State Secrecy Bureau, which is directly responsible for the protection of State secrets of the PRC government, is authorized to block any website it deems to be leaking state secrets or failing to meet the relevant regulations relating to the protection of state secrets in the dissemination of online information. As these regulations are relatively new and subject to interpretation by the relevant authorities, it may not be possible for us to determine in all cases the type of content that could result in liability for us as a website operator. In addition, we may not be able to control or restrict the content of other Internet content providers linked to or accessible through our websites, or content generated or placed on our websites by our users, despite our attempt to monitor such content. To the extent that regulatory authorities find any portion of our content objectionable, they may require us to limit or eliminate the dissemination of such information or otherwise curtail the nature of such content on our websites, which may reduce our user traffic and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to significant penalties for violations of those regulations arising from information displayed on, retrieved from or linked to our websites, including a suspension or shutdown of our operations. Future movements in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the RMB may adversely affect the value of our ADSs. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures. Our payments to overseas game developers and a portion of our financial assets are denominated in U.S. dollars while currently almost all of our revenues are denominated in RMB, the legal currency in China. We have not used any forward contracts or currency borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and Chinas foreign exchange policies. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a managed band based on market supply and demand and by reference to a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in an approximately more than 30% appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar since the introduction of new policy. Our revenues and costs are mostly denominated in RMB, while a portion of our financial assets are denominated in U.S. dollars. We rely substantially on dividends and other fees paid to us by our subsidiaries and affiliated entities in China. Any significant appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADSs in U.S. dollars. For example, an appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would make any new RMB denominated investments or expenditures more costly to us, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for such purposes. 21 Table of Contents Restrictions on currency exchange in China limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively, make dividend payments and meet our foreign currency denominated obligations. Because substantially all of our revenues are in RMB, restrictions on currency exchange in China limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside China, make dividend payments in U.S. dollars, or obtain and remit sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our foreign currency-denominated obligations, such as paying license fees and royalty payments. The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in China is the Foreign Exchange Administration Rules (1996), as amended. Under such rules, the RMB is generally freely convertible for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loans or investment in securities outside China unless the prior approval of SAFE is obtained. Although the PRC government regulations now allow greater convertibility of RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain. For example, foreign exchange transactions under our PRC subsidiaries capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, remain subject to significant foreign exchange controls and the approval of SAFE. These limitations could affect our ability to obtain foreign exchange for capital expenditures. We cannot be certain that the PRC regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB, especially with respect to foreign exchange transactions. PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident shareholders or us to penalties and fines, and limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries ability to increase their registered capital, distribute profits to us, or otherwise adversely affect us. On October 21, 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Reverse Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or Notice 75, which became effective as of November 1, 2005. According to Notice 75, prior registration with the local SAFE branch is required for PRC residents to establish or to control an offshore company for the purposes of financing that offshore company with assets or equity interests in an onshore enterprise located in the PRC. An amendment to registration or filing with the local SAFE branch by such PRC resident is also required for the injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise in the offshore company or overseas funds raised by such offshore company, or any other material change involving a change in the capital or assets of the offshore company. Moreover, Notice 75 applies retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who have established or acquired control of offshore companies that have made onshore investments in the PRC in the past are required to complete the relevant registration procedures with the local SAFE branch by March 31, 2006. Under the relevant rules, failure to comply with the registration requirements set forth in Notice 75 or the rules implementing Notice 75 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the increase of its registered capital, the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and the capital inflow from the offshore entity, and may also subject the relevant onshore companies and PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. Since May 2007, SAFE has further issued relevant guidance to its local branches with respect to the operational process for SAFE registration, which standardized more specific and stringent supervision of the registration relating to Notice 75 and imposed obligations on onshore subsidiaries of offshore special purpose companies to coordinate with and supervise the beneficial owners of the offshore entity who are PRC residents to complete the SAFE registration process and to disclose or make reports to SAFE for such shareholdings of PRC residents in certain circumstances. We have requested all of our shareholders who, based on our knowledge, are PRC residents or whose ultimate beneficial owners are PRC residents to comply with all applicable SAFE registration requirements. However, we have no control over our shareholders. We cannot assure you that the PRC beneficial owners of our company and our subsidiaries have completed the required SAFE registrations or complied with other related requirements. Nor can we assure you that they will be in full compliance with the SAFE registration in the future. Any non-compliance by the PRC beneficial owners of our company and our subsidiaries may subject us or such PRC resident shareholders to fines and other penalties. It may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries and our subsidiaries ability to distribute profits or make other payments to us. 22 Table of Contents Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. We conduct our business primarily through our subsidiaries and affiliated entities incorporated in China. These entities are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly-foreign owned enterprises. In addition, we depend on Shanghai IT to honor its service agreement with us. Almost all of these agreements are governed by PRC law and disputes arising out of these agreements are expected to be decided by arbitration in China. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We may note be able to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions in China due to complicated procedures under PRC laws and regulations for foreign investors to acquire PRC companies. In recent years, certain PRC laws and regulations have established procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. These laws and regulations include, without limitation, the Rules on the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, and the Anti-Monopoly Law and the MOFCOM Security Review Rules. For some instances, MOFCOM needs to be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. The approval by MOFCOM may also need to be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies. PRC laws and regulations also require certain merger and acquisition transactions to be subject to merger control review or security review. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules, effective from September 1, 2011, provide that, when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a domestic enterprise by foreign investors shall be subject to the security review by MOFCOM, the principle of substance over form shall be applied. In particular, foreign investors are prohibited from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. If the business of any target company that we expect to acquire becomes subject to the security review, we may not be able to successfully complete the acquisition of such company, either by equity or asset acquisition, capital contribution or through any contractual arrangement. Complying with the requirements of the PRC laws and regulations to complete acquisition transactions could become more time-consuming and complex. Any required approval, such as approval by MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to grow our business or increase our market share. The limited use of personal computers in China and the relatively high cost of Internet access with respect to per capita gross domestic product may limit the development of the Internet in China and impede our growth. Although the use of personal computers in China has increased in recent years, the penetration rate for personal computers in China is significantly lower than in the United States and other developed countries. Furthermore, despite a decrease in the cost of Internet access in China due to a decrease in the cost of personal computers and the introduction and expansion of broadband access, the cost of Internet access in China still remains relatively high compared to the average per capita income. The limited use of personal computers in China and the relatively high cost of Internet access may limit the growth of our business. In addition, there is no assurance that there will not be any increase in Internet access or telecommunication fees in China. If that happens, the number of our users may decrease and the growth of our user base may be materially impeded. 23 Table of Contents The continued growth of Chinas Internet market depends on the establishment of adequate telecommunications infrastructure. Although private sector Internet service providers currently exist in China, almost all access to the Internet is maintained through state-owned telecommunication operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of Chinas MIIT. In addition, the national networks in China connect to the Internet through government-controlled international gateways. These government-controlled international gateways are the only channel through which a domestic PRC user can connect to the international Internet network. We rely on this infrastructure to provide data communications capacity primarily through local telecommunications lines. Although the government has announced plans to aggressively develop the national information infrastructure, we cannot assure you that this infrastructure will be developed as planned or at all. In addition, we will have no access to alternative networks and services, on a timely basis if at all, in the event of any infrastructure disruption or failure. The Internet infrastructure in China may not support the demands necessary for the continued growth in Internet usage. Risks Related to Our Shares and ADSs We were a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year ended December 31, 2011, which could result in adverse United States federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of our ADSs or ordinary shares. Based on the market price of our ADSs and the value and composition of our assets, we believe we were a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2011. In addition, it is likely that one or more of our subsidiaries were also PFICs for such year. A non-U.S. corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income, or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. We must make a separate determination after the close of each taxable year as to whether we were a PFIC for that year. Because the value of our assets for purposes of the PFIC test will generally be determined by reference to the market price of our ADSs or ordinary shares, our PFIC status will depend in large part on the market price of the ADSs or ordinary shares, which may fluctuate significantly. Because we believe we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2011, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to U.S. Holders (as defined in Item 10. Additional Information  E. Taxation  United States Federal Income Taxation) of our ADSs or ordinary shares with respect to any excess distribution received from us and any gain from a sale or other disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares. See Item 10. Additional Information  E. Taxation  United States Federal Income Taxation  Passive Foreign Investment Company. The future sales or issuance of a substantial number of our ADSs or ordinary shares could adversely affect the price of our ADSs. If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our ADSs, including those issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, in the public market, the market price of our ADSs could fall. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. If any existing shareholder or shareholders sell a substantial amount of ordinary shares, the prevailing market price for our ADSs could be adversely affected. In addition, we may issue additional ordinary shares or ADSs for future acquisitions. If we pay for our future acquisitions in whole or in part with additionally issued ordinary shares or ADSs, your ownership interest in our company would be diluted and this, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ADSs. The market price for our ADSs may be volatile. The market price for our ADSs is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;  announcements of new games by us or our competitors; 24 Table of Contents  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;  price fluctuations of publicly traded securities of other China-based companies engaging in Internet-related services or other similar businesses;  conditions in the Internet or online game industries;  changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other Internet or online game companies;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the RMB;  addition or departure of key personnel; and  pending and potential litigation. In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs. You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and our ability to protect our rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law. Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the Companies Law (2011 Revision) and common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and provides significantly less protection to investors. Therefore, our public shareholders may have more difficulties protecting their interests in the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action before the federal courts of the United States. As a result, our shareholders may not be able to protect their interests if they are harmed in a manner that would otherwise enable them to sue in a United States federal court. Your ability to bring an action against us or against our directors and officers, or to enforce a judgment against us or them, will be limited because we are incorporated in the Cayman Islands, because we conduct a substantial portion of our operations in China and because the majority of our directors and officers reside outside of the United States. We are incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated entities in China. Most of our directors and officers reside outside of the United States and most of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the Cayman Islands or in China in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. You may not be able to exercise your right to vote. As a holder of ADSs, you may instruct the depositary of our ADSs to vote the shares underlying your ADSs but only if we ask the depositary to request your instruction. Otherwise, you will not be able to exercise your right to vote unless you withdraw the shares. However, you may not know about a shareholders meeting enough in advance to withdraw the shares. Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, a shareholders meeting may be convened by us on seven business days notice. If we ask for your instructions, the depositary will notify you of the upcoming vote and arrange to deliver our voting materials to you. We cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote your shares. Pursuant to the amended and revised Deposit Agreement dated November 2010 that we entered into with our depositary, if after complying with the procedures set forth in the agreement, the depositary does not receive instructions from the owner of a receipt on or before the instruction date, the depositary shall vote such deposited securities in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors as advised by our company in writing. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions, if any such action or non-action is in good faith. This means that you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and there may be nothing you can do if the shares underlying your ADSs are not voted as you request. 25 Table of Contents Your right to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings. We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make rights available to you in the United States unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. Also, under the deposit agreement, the depositary bank will not make rights available to you unless the distribution to ADS holders of both the rights and any related securities are either registered under the Securities Act, or exempt from registration under the Securities Act. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The depositary may, but is not required to, sell such undistributed rights to third parties in this situation. Accordingly, you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings. You may not receive distributions on ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical to make them available to you. The depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on ordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your ADSs represent. However, the depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. We have no obligation to register ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or other securities under U.S. securities laws. We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to holders of ADSs. This means that you may not receive the distribution we make on our ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them available to you. These restrictions may have a material adverse effect on the value of your ADSs. You may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs. Your ADSs represented by the ADRs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason.
