ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) no intention at this time to allow golf course development on our adjoining property. Golf operations are also subject to adverse market conditions such as population trends and changing demographics, any of which could adversely affect results of operations. In addition, the golf operations may suffer if the economy weakens, if the popularity of golf decreases, or if unusual weather conditions or other factors cause a reduction in rounds played. Our golf operations are seasonal, primarily due to the impact of the winter tourist season and summer Florida heat and rain. OUR COMMON STOCK IS THINLY TRADED, AND THEREFORE, THE STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE MORE THAN THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or the stock prices of similar companies. Without a larger float, common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading prices for our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price than would be the case if public float were larger. OUR LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS INTERESTS MAY CONFLICT WITH THE INTERESTS OF OTHER INVESTORS, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND MANAGEMENT Our largest shareholder, Wintergreen Advisers, LLC, which owns more than 25% of our outstanding shares, has expressed support for pursuing business strategies which conflict with our current business plan. In addition, this shareholder has presented and obtained approval of certain corporate governance policies which affect operation of the Board of Directors. The effects of these changes on our profitability and operations are unknown. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN LITIGATION THAT COULD BE COSTLY AND DIVERT MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. We are currently involved in litigation with our largest shareholder, Wintergreen Advisers, LLC, relating to the inspection of certain corporate records. We are vigorously defending this action. We cannot, however, determine with certainty the outcome or resolution of this litigation or the timing of its resolution. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. In addition to the expense and burden incurred in defending this litigation, managements efforts and attention may be diverted from ordinary business operations in order to address these claims. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below for more information concerning this litigation. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS NONE
