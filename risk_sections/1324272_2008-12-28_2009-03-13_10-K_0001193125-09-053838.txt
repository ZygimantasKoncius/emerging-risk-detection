Item 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company and its business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. If any of these certain risks and uncertainties were to actually occur, the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Companys common stock could decline and its investors may lose all or part of their investment. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: Current levels of market volatility and the contraction of the capital and real estate markets are unprecedented and are unlikely to improve in the near future, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations and increase the volatility of our common stock. Dramatic declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant market turmoil and tightening of credit. In turn, this has led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally. The Company currently anticipates that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are not likely to improve in the near future. The significant deterioration in economic conditions in any of the Companys markets has and will continue to reduce guest traffic and required certain of the Companys affected restaurants to lower their prices, which reduce the Companys total revenues and operating income. For the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, the Companys Ruths Chris company-owned restaurants experienced an 18.5% decrease in comparable restaurants sales compared with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2007. Ruths Chris company-owned restaurants generated reduced average unit volumes of approximately $5.0 million in fiscal 2008, compared to average unit volumes of approximately $5.6 million in fiscal 2007. The Company believes these economic conditions and market volatility have and may continue to adversely affect the price of its common stock. Any changes in economic conditions, or a continuation or increase in the severity of the current economic downturn would affect the Companys ability to attract guests or price its menu items at favorable levels, which would result in significant reductions in revenue and/or operating income and, in turn, the market price for its common stock. The Company has recently replaced many members of its management and substantially reduced its corporate headcount, and the failure to successfully adapt to these changes and/or a failure by its new management team to successfully manage its operations may reduce net income. In 2008 we have replaced a large portion of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Our future success depends on the ability of our senior management 12 team, many of whom have been with Ruths Chris for less than 12 months, to work together and successfully implement our strategies while maintaining the strength of our brand. If our senior management team fails to work together successfully, or if one or more of our senior managers is unable to effectively implement our business strategy, we may be unable to operate our business in the manner in which we expect. Furthermore, we recently had a substantial reduction in our corporate headcount. This reduction will require remaining corporate team members to fulfill new roles that they have not been filling in the past. If we cannot operate our corporate platform in an effective manner, it may impact our business operations in a material adverse manner. Market volatility could adversely affect our stock price. Many factors affect the trading price of our stock, including factors over which we have no control, such as reports on the economy or the price of commodities, as well as negative or positive announcements by competitors, regardless of whether the report relates directly to our business. In addition to investor expectations, trading activity in our stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders and non-operating initiatives such as a share repurchase program. Any failure to meet market expectations whether for sales growth rates, earnings per share or other metrics could adversely affect our share price. We may not be able to successfully integrate into our business the operations of restaurants that we have acquired, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. On February 19, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of the Mitchells Fish Market, operating under the names Mitchells Fish Market and Columbus Fish Market, and Camerons Steakhouse, operating under the names Camerons Steakhouse and Mitchells Steakhouse from Cameron Mitchell Restaurants, LLC (CMR). These restaurants are the first the Company owned that focus primarily on serving seafood and that do not have the Ruths Chris brand. Achieving the expected benefits of these restaurants and any other restaurants that the Company acquires will depend in a large part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired restaurants and personnel in a timely and efficient manner and develop their brands. The risks involved in the integration of this acquisition include:  the development of a new brand and the operation of restaurants that serve a seafood-based menu as opposed to the Companys current steak-based menu;  challenges and costs associated with the acquisition and integration of restaurant operations located in markets where Ruths Chris has limited or no experience;  possible disruption to the Companys business as a result of the diversion of managements attention from its normal operational responsibilities and duties; and  consolidation of the corporate, information technology, accounting and administrative infrastructure and resources of the acquired restaurants into the Companys business. If the Company cannot overcome the challenges and risks that we face in integrating the operations of newly acquired restaurants, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the restaurants we have acquired. Even after successfully integrating the Mitchells brand into our operations, there can be no assurance that the acquisition will result in the realization of the anticipated benefits. We acquired Mitchells with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits for the combined company including, among others, business and growth opportunities and significant synergies from increased efficiency and effectiveness in restaurant and corporate support. However, we may not be able to realize the synergies, goodwill, business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the acquisition. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors. If these factors limit our 13 ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, our expectations of future results of operations, including the synergies expected to result from the acquisition, may not be met. If such difficulties are encountered or if such synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects are not realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in securities trading markets and general economic downturns may adversely affect our ability to access the credit and capital markets to finance a portion of our working capital requirements and support our liquidity needs. The Company has exposure to many different financial institutions and counterparties including under its existing senior credit facility and other credit and financing arrangements, including interest rate swaps. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event that any of its lenders or counterparties are unable to honor its commitments or otherwise defaults under a financing agreement. Credit and capital markets have recently experienced a great deal of turmoil, and certain leading financial institutions have either declared bankruptcy or have shown significant deterioration in their financial stability. If any of these counterparties declares bankruptcy and/or becomes insolvent, they may not be able to perform under their contracts with the Company, which could leave the Company with reduced or no senior credit facility or unhedged against changes in interest rates. The constriction of the credit markets, if not alleviated, could increase the Companys cost of borrowing or limit its ability to obtain additional financing on terms it finds acceptable. Any significant limitations on its ability to access the financing provided under our existing credit facility or under any of the Companys other credit or financing arrangements could materially and adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations. Our failure to comply with our debt covenants due to a sustained reduction in comparable restaurant sales could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, the Companys Ruths Chris comparable restaurant sales decreased 18.5% from the fourth fiscal quarter 2007. Negative comparable restaurant sales trends have continued through the first nine weeks of 2009. If restaurant sales trends continue to deteriorate throughout the balance of 2009, the impact on EBITDA may result in a breach of compliance with one or several of our financial covenants under our revised Credit Agreement. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition. Consequently, our ability to fund working capital, fund planned capital expenditures, make scheduled payments of principal or interest on our revolver, or refinance the indebtedness, is subject to general economic conditions, competitive environment and other factors. Negative publicity surrounding the Companys restaurants or the consumption of beef generally, or shifts in consumer tastes, could reduce sales in one or more of its restaurants and make its brand less valuable. The Companys success depends, in large part, upon the popularity of its menu offerings. Negative publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns (including e-coli, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (mad cow disease), Hepatitis A and foot and mouth disease), whether related to one of the Companys restaurants or to the beef or seafood industries in general, or operating problems related to one or more restaurants, could make the Companys menu offerings less appealing to consumers and reduce demand in its restaurants. In addition, any other shifts in consumer preferences away from the kinds of food the Company offers, particularly beef and seafood, whether because of dietary or other health concerns or otherwise, would make its restaurants less appealing and adversely affect revenues. In addition, some types of seafood have been subject to adverse publicity due to certain levels of contamination at their source, which can adversely affect both supply and market demand. The Companys Mitchells restaurants maintain an in-house inspection program for seafood purchases and, in the past, have not 14 experienced any detriment from contaminated seafood. However, future seafood contamination or inadequate supplies of seafood could have a significant and materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results and profitability. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with other restaurants, which could reduce its revenues. The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, service, location, food quality, atmosphere and overall dining experience. The Companys competitors include a large and diverse group of well-recognized upscale steakhouse and upscale casual restaurant chains, including steakhouse and seafood chains as well as restaurants owned by independent local operators. Some of the Companys competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources, and may be better established in the markets where its restaurants are or may be located. If the Company cannot compete effectively in one or more of its markets, the Company may be unable to maintain recent levels of comparable restaurant sales growth and/or may be required to close existing restaurants. If the Companys vendors or distributors do not deliver food and beverages in a timely fashion it may experience short-term supply shortages and/or increased food and beverage costs. The Companys ability to maintain consistent quality throughout company-owned restaurants depends in part upon its ability to purchase USDA Prime and Choice grade beef, seafood and other food products in accordance with its rigid specifications. During fiscal 2008, the Company purchased more than 70% of the beef it used in company-owned restaurants from one vendor, New City Packing Company, Inc., with which it has locked prices on 50% of prime beef requirements in 2009. In addition, the Company currently has a long-term distribution arrangement with a national food and restaurant supply distributor, Distribution Market Advantage, Inc. (DMA), which purchases products for the Company from various suppliers, and through which 48 of its company-owned restaurants receive a significant portion of their food supplies. The Company also purchased more than 80% of the fresh seafood served in its Mitchells Fish Market from Michaels Finer Meats and Seafood. If these or other vendors or distributors cease doing business with the Company, it could experience short-term supply shortages in certain company-owned restaurants and could be required to purchase supplies at higher prices until the Company is able to secure an alternative supply source. Any delay the Company experiences in replacing vendors or distributors on acceptable terms could increase food costs or, in extreme cases, require it to temporarily remove items from the menu of one or more restaurants. Increases in the prices of, or reductions in the availability of, any of our core food products could reduce the Companys operating margins and revenues. The Company purchases large quantities of beef, particularly USDA Prime grade beef, which is subject to extreme price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand and other factors. The Companys beef costs represented approximately 34.2% of its food and beverage costs during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, the Company entered into contracts with beef suppliers to establish set pricing on a portion of its anticipated beef purchases. In fiscal 2009, the Company has negotiated set pricing for approximately 50% of its prime beef requirements, which represents 25% of its beef purchases. The market for USDA Prime grade beef is particularly volatile. For example, in late 2003, increased demand, together with the impact of supply rationalization during late 2001 and 2002, resulted in shortages of USDA Prime grade beef, requiring the Company to pay significantly higher prices for the USDA Prime grade beef it purchased. If prices for the types of beef the Company uses in its restaurants increase in the future and it chooses not to pass, or cannot pass, these increases on to its guests, the Companys operating margins would decrease. If certain kinds of beef become unavailable for the Company to purchase, its revenues would decrease as well. In the recent past, certain types of seafood have experienced fluctuations in availability. Seafood is also subject to fluctuations in price based on availability, which is often seasonal. If certain types of seafood are unavailable, or if our costs increase, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 15 Labor shortages or increases in labor costs could slow the Companys growth or harm its business. The Companys success depends in part upon its ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain employees with the qualifications to succeed in its industry and the motivation to apply the Companys core service philosophy, including regional operational managers, restaurant general managers and chefs. If the Company is unable to continue to recruit and retain sufficiently qualified individuals, its business and growth could be adversely affected. Competition for these employees could require the Company to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. In addition, the Company has a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or based on the federal or state minimum wage and who rely on tips as a large portion of their income. Increases in the minimum wage or decreases in allowable tip credits would increase the Companys labor costs. The Company may be unable to increase its prices in order to pass these increased labor costs on to its guests, in which case its margins would be negatively affected. Regulations affecting the operation of the Companys restaurants could increase operating costs and restrict growth. Each of the Companys restaurants must obtain licenses from regulatory authorities allowing it to sell liquor, beer and wine, and each restaurant must obtain a food service license from local health authorities. Each restaurants liquor license must be renewed annually and may be revoked at any time for cause, including violation by the Company or its employees of any laws and regulations relating to the minimum drinking age, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control. In certain states, including states where the Company has a large number of restaurants or where it plans to open restaurants in the near term, the number of liquor licenses available is limited and licenses are traded at market prices. If the Company is unable to maintain existing licenses, or if it chooses to open a restaurant in those states, the cost of a new license could be significant. Obtaining and maintaining licenses is an important component of each of the Companys restaurants operations, and the failure to obtain or maintain food and liquor licenses and other required licenses, permits and approvals would materially adversely impact existing restaurants or the Companys growth strategy. The Company is also subject to a variety of federal and state labor laws, such as minimum wage and overtime pay requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers compensation rates and citizenship requirements. Government-mandated increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, or increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities, or a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements could increase the Companys labor costs and reduce its operating margins. In addition, the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Although the Companys restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled, it could be required to make modifications to its restaurants to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for, disabled persons. The Companys strategy to open franchisee-owned restaurants subjects it to extensive government regulation, compliance with which might increase its investment costs and restrict its growth. The Company is subject to the rules and regulations of the FTC and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC requires that the Company furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular containing prescribed information and can restrict its ability to sell franchises. A number of states also regulate the sale of franchises and require the obtaining of a permit and/or registration of the franchise offering circular with state authorities and the delivery of the franchise offering circular to prospective franchisees. Non-compliance with those laws could result in governmental enforcement actions seeking a civil or criminal penalty, rescission of a franchise, and loss of the Companys ability to offer and sell franchises in a state, or a private lawsuit seeking rescission, damages and legal fees, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. 16 The Companys franchisees could take actions that harm its reputation and reduce its royalty revenues. The Company does not exercise control over the day-to-day operations of its franchisee-owned restaurants. While the Company attempts to ensure that franchisee-owned restaurants maintain the same high operating standards that it demands of company-owned restaurants, one or more of these restaurants may fail to maintain these standards. Any operational shortcomings of the Companys franchisee-owned restaurants are likely to be attributed to its system-wide operations and could adversely affect its reputation and damage its brand as well as have a direct negative impact on the royalty income it receives from those restaurants. The Companys failure to enforce its service marks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect its competitive position or the value of its brands. The Company owns certain common law service mark rights and a number of federal and international service mark registrations, most importantly the Ruths Chris Steak House, Mitchells and Camerons names and logos, copyrights relating to text and print uses, and other proprietary intellectual property rights. The Company believes that its service marks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to its success and competitive position. Protective actions the Company takes with respect to these rights may fail to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could harm the Companys reputation, brand or competitive position and, if the Company commences litigation to enforce its rights, cause us to incur significant legal expenses. Litigation concerning food quality, health and other issues could require the Company to incur additional liabilities and/or cause guests to avoid its restaurants. Occasionally, the Companys guests file complaints or lawsuits against it alleging that the Company is responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to its restaurants. The Company is also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters and discrimination and similar matters. In addition, the Company could become subject to class action lawsuits related to these matters in the future. For example, in fiscal 2005 the Company settled a class-action claim based on violation of wage and hour laws in California. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their guests. In addition, the Company is subject to dram shop statutes. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Recent litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments, including punitive damages, under dram shop statutes. Regardless of whether any claims against the Company are valid or whether it is liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from the Companys operations and hurt its performance. A judgment significantly in excess of the Companys insurance coverage for any claims would materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. Adverse publicity resulting from these claims may negatively impact revenues at one or more of the Companys restaurants. The terms of the Companys senior credit agreement may restrict its ability to operate its business and to pursue its business strategies. The Companys senior credit agreement contains, and any agreements governing future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on it. The Companys senior credit agreement limits its ability, among other things, to:  pay dividends or purchase stock;  borrow money or issue guarantees;  make investments; 17  use assets as security in other transactions;  sell assets or merge with or into other companies;  enter into transactions with affiliates;  sell stock in its subsidiaries; and  create or permit restrictions on its subsidiaries ability to make payments to it. The Companys ability to engage in these types of transactions is limited even if it believes that a specific transaction would contribute to its future growth or improve its operating results. The Companys senior credit agreement also requires it to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with certain financial ratios. The Company anticipated a breach of its maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008. As a result, the Company began negotiations with its bank group, and on February 26, 2009, the Company announced that it had signed an amendment on its credit agreement to provide the Company with requested covenant relief and to make other changes to the existing agreement. The Companys ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events outside of its control. Any non-compliance would result in a default under its senior credit agreement and could result in its lenders declaring the Companys senior debt immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to operate as a going concern. Failure of our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock. Approximately 17.1% of the Companys voting power is controlled by one principal stockholder whose interests may conflict with those of its other stockholders. Affiliates of Madison Dearborn hold approximately 17.1% of the Companys voting power. As a result of this ownership, as well as the fact that a representative of Madison Dearborn serves on the Companys board of directors, Madison Dearborn has significant influence in the consideration of all matters requiring the approval of its stockholders and/or its board of directors. These matters include the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to the Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of its assets. This influence may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or discouraging others from making tender offers for its shares, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. So long as affiliates of Madison Dearborn continue to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock and a representative of Madison Dearborn continues to serve on its board of directors, they will continue to be able to influence the Companys decisions and may pursue corporate actions that conflict with the interests of its other stockholders. The Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that affiliates of Madison Dearborn and their representatives are not required to offer any corporate opportunity of which they become aware to the Company and therefore they could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment. 18 Item 1B.
