Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Operations. Impact of Changes in Interest Rates Interest rates may fluctuate upon changes in financial market conditions and material changes can affect our results from operations and financial condition, since these changes can impact the total interest income received on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as the total interest expense paid on our financial debt. Our interest income (expense), net, as reported on our consolidated statements of income, is the balance between interest income received from our cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities investments and interest expense paid on our long-term debt and bank fees (including fees on committed credit lines). Our interest income is dependent upon fluctuations in interest rates, mainly in U.S. dollars and Euros, since we invest primarily on a short-term basis; any increase or decrease in the market interest rates would mean an equivalent increase or decrease in our interest income. Our interest expenses are mainly associated with our long-term debt, comprised of 2016 Convertible Bonds (with a fixed rate of 1.5%), our 2013 Senior Bonds, which is fixed quarterly at a rate of EURIBOR plus 40bps, and European Investment Bank Floating Rate Loans at LIBOR plus variable spreads; a part of these interest expenses are at fixed rates. See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2010, our total financial resources, including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities current and non-current, generated an average interest income rate of 0.4%. In the same period, our average cost of debt rate was 1.1%. Impact of Changes in Equity Prices As consideration for the divestiture of our share in Numonyx, we received 66.88 million Micron shares and we owed $78 million to one of our partners. These shares were subject to a lock-up period through November 7, 2010; through December 31, 2010, we sold 46.8 million shares at an average price of $8.48 per share, including the unwinding of the applicable hedging contracts. We received proceeds of $319 million net of the $78 million payment to one of our partners referred to above and realized a $13 million loss in the fourth quarter income statement as a result of having not fully hedged 16 million shares. The remaining 20.1 million shares were fully hedged at December 31, 2010, and have been recorded as available-for-sale financial assets and considered as current assets on the basis of the maturity of hedging contracts. At the December 31, 2010 closing, these remaining shares were accounted at their fair market value (trading place of $8.02) for a value of $161 million with the loss compared to the closing price of the deal of $15 million deferred in Net Equity as Other comprehensive income. Furthermore, the derivative hedging instruments were evaluated at their fair market value with the relevant gain ($27 million) deferred in Net Equity as Other comprehensive income. Subsequently, in January 2011, we sold all the remaining Micron shares together with their relevant collar option for the total proceeds of $196 million, realizing a gain of $20 million. For the details of the hedging operations, see Note 27 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Treasury activities are regulated by our policies, which define procedures, objectives and controls. The policies focus on the management of our financial risk in terms of exposure to currency rates and interest rates. Most treasury activities are centralized, with any local treasury activities subject to oversight from our head treasury office. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. dollars and Euros and are placed with financial institutions rated A or better. Part of our liquidity is also held in Euros to naturally hedge intercompany payables and financial 71 Table of Contents debt in the same currency and is placed with financial institutions rated at least a single A long-term rating, meaning at least A3 from Moodys Investor Service and A- from Standard & Poors or Fitch Ratings. Marginal amounts are held in other currencies. See Item 11, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our total liquidity and capital resources were $2,922 million as of December 31, 2010, slightly increasing compared to $2,912 million at December 31, 2009, after having done certain transactions, including, among others, a repurchase for a total amount of $508 million of our 2016 Convertible Bonds and 2013 Senior Bonds and paid $212 million of dividends to shareholders. As of December 31, 2010, our total liquidity and capital resources were comprised of $1,892 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $66 million is held at the ST-Ericsson level, $67 million as short-term deposits and $891 million in marketable securities, all considered as current assets, and $72 million in ARS, considered as non-current assets. Additionally, in order to reconcile with our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010, we had $7 million as restricted cash, related to certain margin calls and we held $161 million fair value of the remaining Micron shares considered in our balance sheet as current marketable securities. As of December 31, 2010, the $891 million held by us in marketable securities as current assets was composed of $563 million invested in Aaa treasury bills from the French, German and U.S. governments and $328 million invested in senior debt floating rate notes issued by primary financial institutions with an average rating, excluding one impaired debt security for a notional value of 15 million, of Aa3/A+ from Moodys and S&P, respectively. Both the treasury bills and the Floating Rate Notes are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, except if deemed to be other-than-temporary. We reported as of December 31, 2010 a before tax increase of $4 million compared to December 31, 2009 in the fair value of our FRN portfolio. Since the duration of the FRN portfolio is only an average of 1.5 years and the securities have a minimum Moodys rating of A2, we expect the value of the securities to return to par as the final maturity approaches (with the only exception being the 15 million of Senior Floating Rate Notes issued by Lehman Brothers, the value of which was impaired through an other-than-temporary charge in 2008). The fair value of these securities is based on market prices publicly available through major financial information providers. The market price of the FRN is influenced by changes in the credit standing of the issuer but is not significantly impacted by movement in interest rates. In 2010, we invested $1,100 million in French, German and U.S. treasury bills, of which $1,011 million was sold or matured during the year. The change in fair value of the $563 million debt securities classified as available-for-sale was not material at December 31, 2010. The average duration of the treasury bills portfolio is less than three months and the securities are rated Aaa by Moodys. As of December 31, 2010, we had Auction Rate Securities, purchased by Credit Suisse contrary to our instruction, representing interests in collateralized debt obligations with a par value of $261 million, that were carried on our balance sheet as available-for-sale financial assets for $72 million, including the positive revaluation of $45 million in Other comprehensive income in equity. Following the continued failure of auctions for these securities which began in August 2007, we first registered a decline in the value of these Auction Rate Securities as an Other-than-temporary impairment charge against net income for $46 million during the fourth quarter of 2007. Since the initial failure of the auctions in August 2007, the market for these securities has completely frozen without any observable secondary market trades, and consequently, during 2008 and 2009, the portfolio experienced a further estimated decline in fair value charged to our Income Statement pursuant to applicable U.S. GAAP of $127 million and $72 million, respectively. The reduction in estimated fair value was recorded as an Other-than-temporary impairment charge against net income. The investments made in the aforementioned Auction Rate Securities were made without our authorization and, in 2008, we launched a legal action against Credit Suisse. For the details of the legal proceedings against Credit Suisse, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the fourth quarter of 2007, as there was no information available regarding mark to market bids and mark to model valuations from the structuring financial institutions for these securities, we based our estimation of fair value on a theoretical model using yields obtainable for comparable assets. The value inputs for the evaluation of these securities were publicly available indices of securities with the same rating, similar duration and comparable/similar underlying collaterals or industries exposure (such as ABX for the collateralized debt obligation and ITraxx and IBoxx for the credit linked notes). The higher impairment charges during 2008 and 2009 reflected downgrading events on the collateral debt obligations comparing the relevant ABX indices of a lower rating category and a general negative trend of the corporate debt market. The estimated value of the collateralized debt obligations could further decrease in the future as a result of credit market deterioration and/or other downgrading. 72 Table of Contents Liquidity We maintain a significant cash position and a low debt to equity ratio, which provide us with adequate financial flexibility. As in the past, our cash management policy is to finance our investment needs mainly with net cash generated from operating activities. During 2010, the evolution of our cash flow produced an increase in our cash and cash equivalents of $304 million, generated by net cash from operating activities. The evolution of our cash flow for each period is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Net cash from operating activities $ 1,794 $ 816 $ 1,722 Net cash from (used in) investing activities (526 ) 290 (2,417 ) Net cash used in financing activities (876 ) (513 ) (67 ) Effect of changes in exchange rates (88 ) (14 ) (84 ) Net cash increase (decrease) $ 304 $ 579 $ (846 ) Net cash from operating activities. Net cash from operating activities is (i) net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and (ii) changes in assets and liabilities. The net cash from operating activities in 2010 was $1,794 million, largely improving compared to the prior year period following the overall improvement in our financial results (see Results of Operations for more information).  Net income adjusted for non-cash items generated $1,565 million of cash in 2010 compared to $369 million in the prior year period.  Changes in assets and liabilities generated cash for a total amount of $229 million, compared to $447 million in the prior year, with the main 2010 item being represented by a favorable change in trade payables, partially balanced by a negative trend in inventory, while in 2009 the favorable change was mainly related to the reduction in inventories. Furthermore, 2010 also included the net cash impact of $166 million, originated by the sales, with no recourse, of receivables done by ST-Ericsson. Net cash from (used in) investing activities. Investing activities used $526 million of cash in 2010, mainly for payments for tangible assets, and net cash from proceeds of the sale of Micron shares. Additionally, such amount included some investments in intangible and financial assets. Payments for the purchase of tangible assets totaled $1,034 million, a significant increase from the $451 million registered in the prior year period, as we upgraded our production capacity in line with the strong increase in demand for our products. Moreover, the net cash from investing activities included $319 million as net proceeds from the sale of Micron stock received on our Numonyx investment divestiture and the release of the $250 million of restricted cash associated with the Hynix-Numonyx JV, following the disposal of our shares in Numonyx. Investing activity in 2009 generated net cash of $290 million, entirely due to $1,137 million net proceeds received from Ericsson as part of a business combination. Net cash used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $876 million in 2010 with an increase compared to the $513 million used in 2009 mainly due to the partial buyback of our issued debt: our 2016 Convertible Bonds for a total cash consideration of $410 million and our 2013 Senior Bonds for the amount of EUR 74 million. Moreover, the 2010 amount included $218 million as a repayment of long term debt at maturity and $212 million as dividends paid to shareholders. Free cash flow (non U.S. GAAP measure). We also present free cash flow, defined as net cash from (used in) operating activities plus (minus) net cash from (used in) investing activities, excluding payment for purchases of and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities (both current and non-current), short-term deposits and restricted cash. We believe free cash flow provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operating activities. Free cash flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. In addition, our definition of free cash flow may differ from 73 Table of Contents definitions used by other companies. Free cash flow is determined as follows from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Audited, in millions) Net cash from operating activities $ 1,794 $ 816 $ 1,722 Net cash from (used in) investing activities (526 ) 290 (2,417 ) Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of marketable securities (current and non-current), short-term deposits and restricted cash, net (307 ) 258 (351 ) Free cash flow $ 961 $ 1,364 $ (1,046 ) We generated free cash flow of $961 million in 2010, of which $349 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, supported by a significant improvement in the cash generated from operating activities. In 2009, free cash flow was $1,364 million, mainly as a result of the $1,137 million net proceeds received from Ericsson as part of a business combination. Excluding the effects of business combinations in both periods, our free cash flow in 2010 was $972 million, including $319 million proceeds from the sale of Micron shares, largely improving by $745 million compared to 2009, in line with the overall improvement in our financial results. Capital Resources Net financial position (non U.S. GAAP measure). Our net financial position represents the balance between our total financial resources and our total financial debt. Our total financial resources include cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current marketable securities, short-term deposits and restricted cash, and our total financial debt includes bank overdrafts, short term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, as represented in our consolidated Balance Sheet. Net financial position is not a U.S. GAAP measure but we believe it provides useful information for investors because it gives evidence of our global position either in terms of net indebtedness or net cash by measuring our capital resources based on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the total level of our financial indebtedness. Our net financial position has been determined as follows from our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents, net of bank overdrafts $ 1,892 $ 1,588 $ 989 Marketable securities, current(1) 891 1,032 651 Restricted cash  250 250 Short-term deposits 67   Marketable securities, non-current 72 42 242 Total financial resources 2,922 2,912 2,132 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (720 ) (176 ) (123 ) Long-term debt (1,050 ) (2,316 ) (2,554 ) Total financial debt (1,770 ) (2,492 ) (2,677 ) Net financial position $ 1,152 $ 420 $ (545 ) (1) The amount of $1,052 million of marketable securities, current reported in our Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010 was composed of: (i) marketable securities ($891 million); and (ii) Micron shares ($161 million). Our net financial position as of December 31, 2010 resulted in a net cash position of $1,152 million, representing a solid improvement compared to the net cash of $420 million at December 31, 2009, mainly due to favorable free cash flow. In the same period, our cash and cash equivalents increased significantly to $1,892 million, while total financial debt decreased by $722 million. At December 31, 2010, our financial debt was $1,770 million, comprised of $720 million short-term, of which $645 million as the current portion of our long-term debt mainly related to our 2016 Convertible Bonds and $1,050 million long-term. The breakdown of our total financial debt included: (i) $534 million of our 2016 Convertible Bonds; (ii) $569 million of our 2013 Senior Bonds (corresponding to 500 million at issuance); (iii) $569 million in European Investment Bank loans (the EIB Loans); (iv) $12 million in loans from other 74 Table of Contents funding programs; (v) $11 million of capital leases; and (vi) $75 million of short-term borrowings related to ST-Ericsson. The EIB Loans represent two committed credit facilities as part of R&D funding programs; the first, related to R&D in France, was fully drawn in U.S. dollars, between December 2006 and February 2008, for a total amount of $341 million, of which $98 million had been paid back as at December 31, 2010; the second, related to R&D projects in Italy, was fully drawn in U.S. dollars, between August and October 2008, for a total amount of $380 million, out of which $54 million had been paid back as of December 31, 2010. Additionally, we had unutilized committed medium term credit facilities with core relationship banks totaling $492 million. Furthermore, the aggregate amount of our total available short-term credit facilities, excluding foreign exchange credit facilities, was approximately $664 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, the amounts available under the short-term lines of credit were not reduced by any borrowing. On September 27, 2010 we signed with the European Investment Bank a new 350 million loan to support our industrial and R&D programs, which is currently undrawn. In 2010 we granted, together with Ericsson, a $200 million committed facility to ST-Ericsson, of which $150 million ($75 million for each parent) was withdrawn as of December 31, 2010. The withdrawal of that line is subject to approval of the parent companies at ST-Ericssons Board of Directors. In January 2011, we and Ericsson extended the overall amount of the credit facility to $300 million. Our long-term capital market financing instruments contain standard covenants, but do not impose minimum financial ratios or similar obligations on us. Upon a change of control, the holders of our 2016 Convertible Bonds and 2013 Senior Bonds may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holders bonds. As of December 31, 2010, debt payments due by period and based on the assumption that convertible debt redemptions are at the holders first redemption option were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter (In millions) Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 1,695 $ 645 $ 109 $ 676 $ 106 $ 84 $ 75 In February 2006, we issued $1,131 million principal amount at maturity zero coupon senior convertible bonds due in February 2016. The bonds are convertible by the holder at any time prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 43.833898 shares per one thousand dollar face value of the bonds corresponding to 42,694,216 equivalent shares. The holders can redeem the convertible bonds upon a change of control or on February 23, 2012 at a price of $1,093.81 and on February 24, 2014 at a price of $1,126.99 per one thousand dollar face value of the bonds. On February 23, 2011, the holders redeemed 41,123 convertible bonds at a price of $1,077.58, out of the total of 490,170 outstanding bonds, or about 8%. We can call the bonds at any time after March 10, 2011 subject to our share price exceeding 130% of the accreted value divided by the conversion rate for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days. In order to optimize our liquidity management and yield, we repurchased a portion of our 2016 Convertible Bonds during 2009 (98,000 bonds for a total cash consideration of $103 million and corresponding to 4,295,722 shares) and in 2010 (385,830 bonds for a total cash consideration of $410 million and corresponding to 16,912,433 shares). As of December 31, 2010, we had the following credit ratings on our 2013 Senior Bonds and 2016 Convertible Bonds: Moodys Investors Service Standard & Poors Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Bonds due 2016 Baa1 BBB+ Floating Rate Senior Bonds due 2013 Baa1 BBB+ We are also rated A− from Fitch on an unsolicited basis. On February 6, 2009 Standard & Poors Rating Services lowered our senior debt rating from A− to BBB+. On January 27, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the Baa1 senior debt ratings and changed the outlook on the ratings to stable from negative. In March 2006, STMicroelectronics Finance B.V. (ST BV), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, issued Floating Rate Senior Bonds with a principal amount of 500 million at an issue price of 99.873%. The notes, which mature on March 17, 2013, pay a coupon rate of the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.40% on June 17, September 17, December 17 and March 17 of each year through maturity. The notes have a put for early repayment in case of a change of control. The Floating Rate Senior Bonds issued by ST BV are guaranteed by ST NV. We repurchased a portion of our 2013 Senior Bonds: (i) during the third quarter 2010, for the amount of $17 million and (ii) during the fourth quarter 2010 for the amount of $81 million. 75 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies Our contractual obligations, commercial commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2010, and for each of the five years to come and thereafter, were as follows(1): Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Operating leases(2) $ 378 $ 103 $ 77 $ 49 $ 29 $ 26 $ 94 Purchase obligations(2) 1,116 1,003 74 24 14  1 of which: Equipment and other asset purchase 632 632      Foundry purchase 224 224      Software, technology licenses and design 260 147 74 24 14  1 Other obligations(2) 371 158 174 30 6  3 Long-term debt obligations (including current portion)(3)(4)(5) of which: 1,695 645 109 676 106 84 75 Capital leases(3) 11 4 2 2 2  1 Pension obligations(3) 326 30 29 30 36 32 169 Other non-current liabilities(3) 295 32 67 17 9 8 162 Total $ 4,181 $ 1,971 $ 530 $ 826 $ 200 $ 150 $ 504 (1) Contingent liabilities which cannot be quantified are excluded from the table above. (2) Items not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010. (3) Items reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010. (4) See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2010 for additional information related to long-term debt and redeemable convertible securities. (5) Year of payment is based on maturity before taking into account any potential acceleration that could result from a triggering of the change of control provisions of the 2016 Convertible Bonds and the 2013 Senior Bonds. As a result of our planned closures of certain manufacturing facilities, some of the aforementioned contracts have been terminated. The termination fees for the sites still in operation have not been taken into account. Operating leases are mainly related to building leases and to equipment. The amount disclosed is composed of minimum payments for future leases from 2011 to 2015 and thereafter. We lease land, buildings, plants and equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates under non-cancelable lease agreements. Purchase obligations are primarily comprised of purchase commitments for equipment, for outsourced foundry wafers and for software licenses. Other obligations primarily relate to firm contractual commitments with respect to cooperation agreements. Long-term debt obligations mainly consist of bank loans, convertible and non-convertible debt issued by us that is totally or partially redeemable for cash at the option of the holder. They include maximum future amounts that may be redeemable for cash at the option of the holder, at fixed prices. See Net financial position (non U.S. GAAP measure). Pension obligations and termination indemnities amounting to $326 million consist of our best estimates of the amounts projected to be payable by us for the retirement plans based on the assumption that our employees will work for us until they reach the age of retirement. The final actual amount to be paid and related timing of such payments may vary significantly due to early retirements, terminations and changes in assumptions rates. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the FMG deconsolidation, we retained the obligation to fund the severance payment (trattamento di fine rapporto) due to certain transferred employees by the defined amount of about $26 million which qualifies as a defined benefit plan and was classified as an other non-current liability at December 31, 2010. Other non-current liabilities include, in addition to the above-mentioned pension obligation, future obligations related to our restructuring plans and miscellaneous contractual obligations. They also include at December 31, 2010, following the FMG deconsolidation in 2008, a long-term liability for capacity rights amounting to $33 million. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of December 31, 2010, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $116 million. We do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in 2011. We are not, however, able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of when these benefits will be recognized. 76 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2010. Financial Outlook The increase in demand that we have been broadly facing across all end markets requires the acceleration of some of our capex spending in order to adapt our supply capability to this increasing level of demand. In order to support our innovative product portfolio and to fuel revenue growth faster than the served market dynamic, we expect to invest approximately $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2011 based on anticipated revenue growth. The most significant of our 2011 capital expenditure projects are expected to be: (a) for the front-end facilities: (i) in our 300-mm fab in Crolles, mix evolution to support the production ramp-up of the newest technologies and capacity growth, and activities to prepare the next step to 4,500 wafers per week, planned by end 2012 within the framework of our Crolles Nano 2012 program; (ii) the completion of the 32nm/28nm R&D capability investment in Crolles; (iii) the upgrade and partial conversion to 150-mm of our 125-mm fab in Ang-Mo-Kio (Singapore); (iv) selective programs of mix evolution in our 200-mm fabs, mainly in the fabs of Crolles and Rousset; (v) capacity increase in selected proprietary technologies in our 200-mm fabs in Italy (MEMS, Advanced BCDs and PMOS) and (vi) quality, safety, security and maintenance in both 150-mm and 200-mm front end fabs; (b) for the back-end facilities, capital expenditures will mainly be dedicated to: (i) capacity growth on strategic package families, mainly in the areas of Automotive, MEMS and Wireless, to sustain marked demand; (ii) further consolidation of our presence in China (Longgang and Shenzhen), in Muar and in Calamba; (iii) modernization of package lines (copper bonding); and (iv) specific investments in the areas of quality, environment and energy saving; and (c) an overall capacity increase in final testing and wafers probing (EWS) for all product lines. We will continue to monitor our level of capital spending by taking into consideration factors such as trends in the semiconductor industry, capacity utilization and announced additions. We expect to have significant capital requirements in the coming years and in addition we intend to continue to devote a substantial portion of our net revenues to R&D and to continue to support ST-Ericsson towards its expected recovery. We plan to fund our capital requirements from cash provided by operating activities, available funds and available support from third parties, and may have recourse to borrowings under available credit lines and, to the extent necessary or attractive based on market conditions prevailing at the time, the issuing of debt, convertible bonds or additional equity securities. A substantial deterioration of our economic results and consequently of our profitability could generate a deterioration of the cash generated by our operating activities. Therefore, there can be no assurance that, in future periods, we will generate the same level of cash as in the previous years to fund our capital expenditures plans for expending/upgrading our production facilities, our working capital requirements, our R&D and industrialization costs. On February 23, 2011, holders were able to call for the redemption of our outstanding 2016 Convertible Bonds, which occurred for 41,123 bonds, for an amount of $44 million. The residual amount outstanding after the exercise was $449 million, which can be exercised on February 23, 2012 for an amount of $491 million. Furthermore, there could be possible financial needs for temporary bridge short-term financing by the parent companies of the ST-Ericsson joint venture. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next twelve months, including capital expenditures for our manufacturing activities, working capital requirements, dividend payments and the repayment of our debts in line with their maturity dates. We may use some of our available cash to repurchase a portion of our outstanding debt securities, including possibly our 2016 Convertible Bonds and 2013 Senior Bonds, should market conditions permit.
