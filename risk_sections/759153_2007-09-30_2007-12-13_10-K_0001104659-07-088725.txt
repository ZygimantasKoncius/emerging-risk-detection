Item 1A. Risk Factors We have limited sources of liquidity and may not be able to obtain sufficient funding to realize positive cash flows. We require substantial capital to pursue our operating strategy and execute our business plan. As we have no revenue and therefore limited sources of cash, we will continue to rely on external sources for liquidity, and for the foreseeable future, our principal source of working capital will be from capital we have raised through private placements of our securities and other external sources. In managements opinion, based on available cash and cash equivalents on hand as of September 30, 2007, we will need to reduce overhead and research and development costs as compared to previous years, complete the sale of various non-core assets or may need to raise additional outside capital in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. Our current monthly operating overhead is approximately $350,000, excluding research and development project costs and non-cash expenses such as depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-cash expenses, and we expect that such amount will increase as we expand our operations. Should we require additional capital, we may not be able to obtain funds from external sources in sufficient amounts to fund our business plan. Even if we are able to demonstrate full commercial success with our products, we may require additional capital in the future to produce our products in sufficient commercial quantities in order for us to realize positive cash flows. Any such additional capital may lead to additional dilution of our shareholders. Additionally, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital in sufficient quantities or at all. We have a limited operating history and no revenues and are subject to risks inherent in a new business enterprise. As a result, we have not demonstrated to date that we can fully implement our business plan or that the PID technology will be profitable in a commercial application. The business of PDTI was originally established in June 2003 to: (1) purchase certain of the assets and assume certain of the liabilities of PSI and PSIL related to the PID technology; (2) purchase certain patents underlying the PID technology from CFLP; (3) acquire certain technology licenses related to the PID technology from CTL; (4) continue the funding of research and development expenses with respect to the technology acquired; and (5) take steps towards the commercialization of the PID technology. To date, the business has not generated revenue from its operations. We may not be able to fully commercialize our product or generate profitable revenues. Additionally, we and our business have a limited operating history that investors can analyze to aid them in making an informed judgment as to the merits of an investment in us. Any investment in us should be considered a high risk investment because you will be investing in a company with unforeseen costs, expenses, competition, and other problems to which new ventures are often subject. In addition, the technology we acquired is still in the early stage of development for commercial use and has produced only limited results in a commercial setting. Because we are an early stage company, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties encountered in establishing a new business in a highly competitive industry. The PID System is a new technology and it may not be fully accepted in the marketplace to the degree anticipated by management. The PID technology has only been used or deployed in limited commercial gas wells. To managements knowledge, no company has yet marketed a salable product using the technology we are developing. Market acceptance of our products will largely depend upon our ability to demonstrate the PID Systems efficiency, cost effectiveness, safety features and ease of use. We may not be able to demonstrate that the PID System can effectively be deployed on a significant number of commercial oil and gas wells in a safe and cost-effective manner. The use of the PID technology will also depend upon concerted sales efforts by our management team. The PID System may never be fully accepted in the market in preference to other competing technologies that currently exist or that may subsequently be developed. If our products are not fully accepted by the marketplace, we may not realize sufficient revenues or cash flow to execute our operations plan and we may be forced to pursue a different strategy or liquidate our company. In order to enter the oilfield services market on a full scale basis, we must successfully complete additional research and development, the cost of which may exceed the amounts we have budgeted in our operations plan. Any such cost overruns 9 could exhaust our available capital and force us to raise additional capital, which capital may not be available or may lead to additional dilution of our shareholders. Our primary products must demonstrate satisfactory performance in a significant number of oil and gas wells. Our operations plan calls for further research and development, including the development of different bit sizes and the completion of our development effort to deliver a new particle injection system. Poor performance of the PID bit or other components of the PID System while conducting commercial trials could reveal additional unidentified issues and further extend the shop and laboratory testing phase, which could further delay the full commercialization of the PID System and increase the funds needed to complete our research and development. Further, in order to fully implement our business plan, we will be required to hire and train a substantial number of new employees. Currently, the oilfield industry is strained and operating at near full capacity from a human resource perspective, which could limit our ability to hire and train adequate qualified personnel. These circumstances would have the effect of slowing our advancement as funds otherwise intended to build new PID Systems and expand our operations may be needed to conduct additional research or procure and train adequate human resources. Regardless of the success of the initial research and development, we will require additional research and development and capital spending to continuously improve our service capabilities and expand our operations. In addition, regardless of the amount of research and development completed by us, our products may never be fully adopted in a significant number of oil and gas wells. We are obligated to make certain royalty payments that will limit our profitability. In connection with our acquisition of the PID technology, we agreed to make certain royalty payments to PSI and PSIL. Under our agreement with PSI, we are obligated to pay PSI a royalty on a quarterly basis equal to 18.0% of EBITDA derived from the use of the PID technology for such quarter until an aggregate of $67,500,000 has been paid to PSI. Under our agreement with PSIL, we are obligated to pay PSIL a royalty on a quarterly basis equal to 2.0% of our EBITDA derived from the use of the PID technology for such quarter until an aggregate of $7,500,000 has been paid. We have also entered into additional royalty agreements that require us to pay a total of 4.0% of our quarterly gross revenue derived from the use of the PID technology to certain entities from which we acquired the PID technology. These royalty obligations will have the effect of limiting our liquidity and our profitability. We rely on the intellectual property rights we acquired to the PID technology and we may not be able to successfully protect or defend our intellectual property rights. Our competitive position depends to a significant extent on our ability to assert and defend our intellectual property rights in order to restrict other competitors from offering similar services. Our success depends on certain patents and patent applications that we purchased from CFLP, CTL, PSI and PSIL, along with other proprietary intellectual property rights we have developed or intend to develop. We rely on a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property. The steps we have taken to protect our rights may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. We also may not be able to detect unauthorized use of and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights as fully or in the same manner as do the laws of the United States. Also, despite the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to the PID technology and/or design around the proprietary rights we own. We are also subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Any such claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to the intellectual property which is the subject of the asserted infringement. If we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, or if claims are successfully brought against us for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, such events could cause us to pay substantial damages, cause us to lose a key competitive advantage, force us to conduct additional research to develop non-infringing technology or cause us to have to pursue a different business strategy. We may face intense competition in our industry from companies with a more established reputation and greater financial resources than us. The oilfield services industry is highly competitive, and most of our potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do. Many of our potential competitors have been in the oilfield drilling business for many years and have 10 well-established business contacts with exploration and production companies. Competitors may enter markets served or proposed to be served by us, and we may not be able to compete successfully against such companies or have adequate funds to compete effectively. If we are able to successfully commercialize the PID technology, we expect that demand for our PID System will depend on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices and other factors. If we are able to successfully commercialize the PID technology, we expect that demand for our PID System will be substantially dependent on the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. Oil and natural gas companies typically reduce exploration and development activity during periods of low or volatile oil and natural gas prices. The markets for oil and natural gas historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the level of exploration, development and production activity by our customers which will result in a decrease in the demand for our PID System and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include:  the level of demand for oil and natural gas;  worldwide political, military and economic conditions, including, but not limited to, the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil;  oil and natural gas production/inventory levels;  the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;  global weather conditions;  interest rates and cost of capital; and  tax laws. Because our PID System is used in potentially hazardous applications and operations, our business is subject to risks associated with events that result in personal injuries, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment and suspension of operations. Our PID System is used in potentially hazardous drilling applications. These activities are dangerous and accidents can result in:  personal injury;  loss of life;  damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment; and  suspension of operations. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our PID System is used may result, in the future, in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. The frequency and severity of any of these incidents would affect our operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. Any increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of 11 compensation awards resulting from these incidents, could affect our ability to obtain projects from oil and natural gas companies or insurance covering these incidents. Compliance with environmental and other government regulations could adversely affect our business. Our business is significantly affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to:  the oil and natural gas industry; and  worker safety and environmental protection. If we are able to successfully commercialize the PID technology, we expect that demand for our PID System will be affected by a variety of factors, including taxes, price controls and the adoption or amendment of laws and regulations. For example, the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing the exploration and development of oil and natural gas in our expected areas of operation for economic, environmental or other policy reasons could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services. The technical requirements of the foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our businesses are becoming increasingly complex and stringent. For instance, some environmental laws may provide for strict liability for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Sanctions for noncompliance with these laws and regulations may include:  revocation of permits;  issuance of corrective action orders;  assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties; and  issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting our operations. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws and regulations also may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others, or for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed. Our stockholders may experience substantial dilution as a result of the exercise of outstanding options and warrants to purchase our common stock or future issuances of additional shares of our common stock, any of which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In connection with our acquisition of our subsidiary, Particle Drilling Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, we assumed warrants to purchase 86,141 shares of common stock and options issued under PDTIs 2004 Incentive Stock Plan to purchase 2,760,000 shares of common stock. In connection with the private placement of our common stock in February 2005, we granted the placement agent warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, of which 205,000 were still outstanding as of September 30, 2007. In connection with the private placement of our common stock in October 2006, we granted the investors warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock. Since our acquisition of PDTI, we have issued options to purchase an additional 1,303,375 shares of our common stock under our equity incentive plans. The common stock issuable upon exercise of these options and warrants represents approximately 18% of our outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis. The exercise of these options and warrants would result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and any sales of these shares of common stock, or the perception that these sales might occur, could lower the market price of our common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel, future acquisitions, future public offerings or private placements of 12 our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility. The limited trading volume of our common stock may contribute to this price volatility. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe this volatility is due to, among other things, our lack of revenues, current expectations of our future financial performance and the volatility of the stock market in general. Moreover, our common stock, which began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market® on June 28, 2005, does not have substantial trading volume. During the year ended September 30, 2007, the average daily trading volume of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Capital Market® was approximately 121,000 shares, which represents less than 1% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, relatively small trades of our common stock may have a significant impact on the price of our common stock and, therefore, may contribute to the price volatility of our common stock. Because of the limited trading volume in our common stock and the price volatility of our common stock, you may be unable to sell your shares of common stock when you desire or at the price you desire. Moreover, the inability to sell your shares in a declining market because of such illiquidity or at a price you desire may substantially increase your risk of loss. We presently do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that no cash dividends will be paid on our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, we anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained to finance the future expansion of our company.
