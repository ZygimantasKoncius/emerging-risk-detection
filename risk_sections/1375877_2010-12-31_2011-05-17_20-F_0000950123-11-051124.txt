Duties of Directors Under our governing statute, our directors have a duty of loyalty  to act honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests. They also have a duty to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. A shareholder has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached. The functions and powers of our board of directors include, among others:  convening shareholder meetings and reporting to shareholders at such meetings;  declaring dividends and authorizing other distributions to shareholders;  appointing officers and determining the term of office of officers;  exercising the borrowing powers of our company and mortgaging the property of our company; and  approving the issuance of shares. B. Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers Cash Compensation We paid our directors and executive officers aggregate cash remuneration, including salaries, bonuses and benefits in kind, of approximately $2,124,130 for 2010. Of this amount, we paid $249,000 to our three independent directors and $1,875,130 to our executive officers. Share-based Compensation Share Incentive Plan In March 2006, we adopted a share incentive plan, or the Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to promote the success and enhance the value of the Company by linking the personal interests of the directors, officers and employees to those of the shareholders and providing the directors, officers and employees with an incentive for outstanding performance to generate superior returns to the shareholders. The Plan is also intended to motivate, attract and retain the services of the directors, officers and employees upon whose judgment, interest and effort the successful conduct of the Companys operations is largely dependent. In September 2010, the shareholders approved an amendment to the Plan to increase the maximum number of common shares which may be issued pursuant to all awards of options and restricted shares under the Plan to the sum of (i) 2,330,000 plus (ii) the sum of (a) 1% of the number of outstanding common shares of the Company on the first day of each of 2007, 2008 and 2009 plus (b) 2.5% of the number of outstanding common shares of the Company on the first day of each calendar year after 2009. As at March 31, 2011, the maximum number of common shares which may be issued pursuant to all awards of options and restricted shares under the Plan was 5,371,700 shares, of which 3,261,329 options and 566,190 restricted shares (in both cases net of forfeitures) have been awarded, leaving 1,544,181 shares available to be issued. The following describes the principal terms of the Plan. Types of Awards. We may make the following types of awards under the Plan:  options to purchase our common shares, and  restricted shares, which are non-transferable common shares without voting or dividend rights. Plan Administration. The Compensation Committee of our board of directors administers the Plan, except with respect to awards made to our non-employee directors, where the entire board of directors 72 Table of Contents administers the Plan. The Compensation Committee or the full board of directors, as appropriate, determines the provisions, terms, and conditions of each award. Award Agreement. Awards are evidenced by an award agreement that sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each award. Eligibility. We may grant awards to employees, directors and consultants of our Company or any of our related entities, which include our subsidiaries and any entities in which we hold a substantial ownership interest. We may, however, grant options that are intended to qualify as incentive share options only to our employees. Acceleration of Awards upon Corporate Transactions. Outstanding awards will accelerate upon a change-of-control where the successor entity does not assume our outstanding awards. In such event, each outstanding award will become fully vested and immediately exercisable, the transfer restrictions on the awards will be released and the repurchase or forfeiture rights will terminate immediately before the date of the change-of-control transaction. Exercise Price and Term of Awards. In general, the Compensation Committee determines the exercise price of an option and sets out the price in the award agreement. The exercise price may be a fixed or variable price related to the fair market value of our common shares. If we grant an incentive share option to an employee who, at the time of that grant, owns shares representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of our share capital, the exercise price cannot be less than 110% of the fair market value of our common shares on the date of that grant and the share option is exercisable for no more than five years from the date of that grant. The term of an award may not exceed ten years from the date of the grant. Vesting Schedule. In general, the Compensation Committee determines the vesting schedule. Options The following table summarizes, as of March 31, 2011, the options granted under the Plan to our directors and executive officers and to other individuals, individually and as a group. The options granted in May 2006 vest over a four-year period beginning in March 2006. Unless otherwise noted, all other options granted vest over a four-year period (one-quarter on each anniversary date) from the date of grant, and exercise prices are equal to the average of the trading prices of the common shares for the five trading days preceding the date of grant.

Qualification There is no shareholding qualification for directors. Employment Agreements We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. All of our executive employment agreements are for an indefinite term. Under the employment agreements, we may terminate an executive officers employment at any time for cause without notice and for any other reason by giving written notice of termination to the executive officer. An executive officer may terminate his employment at any time by giving 60 days notice of termination to us.

We plan to hire additional employees as we expand. E. Share Ownership The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common shares as of March 31, 2011, the latest practicable date, by:  each of our directors and executive officers; and  each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of our common shares. 80 Table of Contents The calculations in the table below are based on the 43,530,915 common shares outstanding, as of March 31, 2011.

Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information We have appended audited consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report. Legal and Administrative Proceedings Class Action Lawsuits On June 1, 2010, we announced that we would postpone the release of our financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010 and our quarterly earnings call pending the outcome of an investigation by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors that had been launched after we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents relating to, among other things, certain sales transactions in 2009. Thereafter six class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or 82 Table of Contents the New York cases, and another class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, or the California case. The New York cases were consolidated into a single action in December 2010. On January 5, 2011, the California case was dismissed by the plaintiff, who became a member of the lead plaintiff group in the New York action. On March 11, 2011, a consolidated amended complaint was filed with respect to the New York action. The consolidated amended complaint alleges generally that our financial disclosures during 2009 and early 2010 were false or misleading; asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and names us, our chief executive officer and our former chief financial officer as defendants. We filed our motion to dismiss in May 2011. In addition, a similar class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our executive officers in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on August 10, 2010. The lawsuit alleges generally that our financial disclosures during 2009 and/or 2010 were false or misleading and brings claims under the shareholders relief provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act, Part XXIII.1 of the Ontario Securities Act as well as claims based on negligent misrepresentation. In December 2010, we filed a motion to dismiss the Ontario action on the basis that the Ontario Court has no jurisdiction over the claims and potential claims advanced by the plaintiff. The motion was argued in the Ontario Court on May 10 and 11, 2011, and the court scheduled additional hearing in June 2011 on this. We believe the claims, both in the United States and in Canada, are without merit and intend to defend against the lawsuits vigorously. Shunda On November 12, 2009, Jiangsu Shunda Semiconductor Development Co., Ltd., or Shunda, a former supplier of silicon wafers to us, filed a lawsuit in the Intermediate Peoples Court of Yangzhou against CSI Cells, our wholly owned subsidiary. Shunda claimed damages of RMB40.0 million (approximately $5.9 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010 of RMB6.775 per $1.00), alleging that CSI Cells failed to perform its purchase obligations under a silicon wafer supply agreement that CSI Cells and Shunda entered into in July 2008. On January 18, 2010, Shunda filed a lawsuit in the Peoples Court of Gaoyou Jiangsu Province alleging that CSI Cells failed to perform its obligations under a silicon wafer supply agreement that CSI Cells and Shunda entered into in February 2008. Shunda asked the court to compel CSI Cells to take delivery of certain shipments of solar wafers and to pay storage costs of RMB60, 000. CSI Cells had made an advance payment of RMB3.36 million under that agreement. On February 20, 2010, CSI Cells filed a request for arbitration against Shunda with the Shanghai Branch of the China Economic & Trade Arbitration Commission. In its arbitration request, CSI Cells moved to rescind a long-term silicon wafer supply agreement entered into between CSI Cells and Shunda in December 2007 and requested that Shunda refund a RMB11.52 million (approximately $1.7 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010) advance payment that it had made under that agreement. On July 12, 2010, CSI Cells and Shunda entered into an agreement to settle all of the matters described above. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, (i) CSI cells paid Shunda RMB20.0 million (approximately $3.0 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010) under the July 2008 silicon wafer supply agreement, (ii) Shunda refunded to CSI Cells RMB2.86 million (approximately $0.4 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010) of the advance payment CSI Cells made under the February 2008 supply agreement and (iii) Shunda refunded to CSI Cells the RMB11.52 million advance payment made under the December 2007 supply agreement. Systaic On February 3, 2010, we filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Cologne, Germany against our former customer Systaic. We sought damages of approximately 4.8 million, plus interest, because of Systaics failure to pay the purchase price for two shipments of solar modules that Systaic ordered in March and June 2009. 83 Table of Contents On September 14, 2010, the court ordered Systaic to pay us the full amount plus interest. On October 15, 2010, Systaic filed an appeal with respect to the claims related to the goods ordered in March 2009 and a contractual penalty resulting from the failed payment. The amount subject to appeal is 1.6 million plus interest. The courts judgment awarding us 3.2 million plus interest is final and binding. We believe that such appeal has no merit. We filed our reply to Systaics appeal in February 2011. On December 14, 2010, preliminary insolvency proceedings were opened against Systaic. As a result of the insolvency proceedings, we cannot predict whether we will be able to enforce the judgment or whether our credit insurance coverage will pay our damages if we cannot enforce the judgment. LDK In July 2010, CSI Cells filed a request for arbitration against LDK with the Shanghai Branch of the China Economic & Trade Arbitration Commission. In its arbitration request, CSI Cells asked that LDK refund (1) an advance payment of RMB10.0 million (approximately $1.5 million based on the exchange rate in effect on April 15, 2011]) that it had made to LDK pursuant to a three-year wafer supply agreement between CSI Cells and LDK entered into in October 2007 and (2) two advance payments totaling RMB50.0 million (approximately $7.66 million based on the exchange rate in effect on April 15, 2011) that CSI Cells had made to LDK pursuant to two ten-year supply agreements between CSI Cells and LDK entered into in June 2008. The first hearing was held in October 2010, during which CSI Cells and LDK exchanged and reviewed the evidence. After the first hearing, LDK counterclaimed against CSI Cells, seeking (1) forfeiture of the three advance payments totaling RMB60.0 million (approximately $9.2 million based on the exchange rate in effect on April 15, 2011) that CSI Cells had made to LDK pursuant to the October 2007 and June 2008 agreements; (2) compensation of approximately RMB377 million (approximately $57.8 million based on the exchange rate in effect on April 15, 2011) for the loss due to the alleged breach of the June 2008 agreements by CSI Cells; (3) a penalty of approximately RMB15.2 million (approximately $2.3 million based on the exchange rate in effect on April 15, 2011) due to the alleged breach of the June 2008 agreements by CSI Cells; and (4) arbitration expenses up to RMB4.7 million (approximately $719,743 based on the exchange rate in effect on April 15, 2011). The second hearing was held on March 9, 2011, during which the parties presented arguments to the arbitration commission. The arbitration commission will host settlement discussions between the parties in late May 2011. Premier Power Group In September 2010, we filed a payment injunction request in the District Court of Campobasso, Italy, against our former customer Premier Power Italy S.p.A., or PPI, for outstanding receivables relating to our products sold to PPI totaling approximately 7.2 million (approximately $9.6 million based on the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010), plus legal costs and interest. In October 2010, we filed a parallel action seeking seizure of certain assets in the District Court of Campobasso, Italy, against Global Green Energy s.a.r.l., or GGE, as guarantor to PPIs payment obligation to us pursuant to a letter of guarantee issued by GGE in our favor in May 2010. In December 2010, PPI and GGE settled the outstanding payment with us through a settlement agreement among PPI, GGE and Premier Power Renewable Energy Inc., the parent entity of PPI. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, GGE paid us an amount of approximately 7.6 million (approximately $10.2 million based on the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010) in exchange of PPIs payment obligations to us. Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any dividends, nor do we have any present plan to declare or pay any dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. Our board of directors has complete discretion on whether to pay dividends. Even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations, 84 Table of Contents earnings, capital requirements, surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. B. Significant Changes Between January 1, 2011 and March 31, 2011, an additional 32,900 options and nil restricted shares granted under the Plan vested.
