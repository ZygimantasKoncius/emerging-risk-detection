ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  continued recognition of revenue, accounting for leases and disclosures related to our participation in multiemployer plans. Furthermore, a conversion from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to International Financial Reporting Standards could change the way we account for, disclose and present various aspects of our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Potential future changes in accounting rules and regulations could be time-consuming and costly to implement. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including: · Any liability resulting from and the cost of defending against class-action litigation, such as alleged violations of anti-trust laws, wage-and-hour and discrimination claims, and any other legal proceedings; · Widespread outbreak of an illness or communicable disease or public health crisis; and · Operational or market disruptions, including infrastructure damage, increases in costs of supplies or significant declines in demand for our services arising from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, such as hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, and from illegal acts, including terrorist attacks. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome resulting from these risks and uncertainties. ITEM 1B.
