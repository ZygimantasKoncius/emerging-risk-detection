ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) for the first quarter. Principally due to these factors, our first and fourth quarters may be less robust than our second and third quarters. Our Board of Directors may authorize future sales of ENGlobal common stock, which could result in a decrease in value to existing stockholders of the shares they hold. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to an additional 47,705,148 shares of common stock and an additional 2,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock as of the date of filing. These shares may be issued without stockholder approval unless the issuance is 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, in which case the NASDAQ requires stockholder approval. We may issue shares of stock in the future in connection with acquisitions or financings. In addition, we may issue options as incentives under an equity incentive plan. Future issuances of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the ability of the board of directors to issue additional stock may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control of the Company, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
