ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Commercial Real Estate and Business Loans Increase Our Exposure to Credit Risks. At December 31, 2006, our portfolio of commercial real estate and business loans totaled $2.6 billion, or 46% of total loans. We plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans, which generally exposes us to a greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential real estate loans because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one commercial loan outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential real estate loan. We target our business lending and marketing strategy towards small to medium-sized businesses. These small-to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Increases to the Allowance for Credit Losses May Cause Our Earnings to Decrease. Our customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Hence, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past experience and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income. 17 Our emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating our allowance for credit losses. As we continue to increase the amount of these loans, additional or increased provisions for credit losses may be necessary and as a result would decrease our earnings. Bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition. Concentration of Loans in Our Primary Market Area May Increase Risk. Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in Upstate New York. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in Upstate New York have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing those loans. A significant decline in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could negatively affect our financial results. Changes in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Because our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in our net interest income. We have taken steps to mitigate this risk such as holding fewer longer-term residential mortgages as well as investing excess funds in shorter-term investments. Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our investment securities available for sale. Generally, the value of our investment securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2006, our investment securities available for sale totaled $1.1 billion. Unrealized losses on our securities available for sale, net of tax, amounted to $14.1 million and are reported as a separate component of our stockholders' equity. Decreases in the fair value of our securities available for sale, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity. Changes in interest rates may also affect the average life of our loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on our existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Our Ability to Grow May Be Limited if We Cannot Make Acquisitions. In an effort to fully deploy our excess capital and to increase our loans and deposits, we intend to continue to acquire other financial institutions, financial services companies or branches. We compete with other financial institutions with respect to proposed acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms. In addition, we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquired institutions in a timely and efficient manner, that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or that we will be successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies. Our Expanding Branch Network May Affect Our Financial Performance. Since 1998, we have expanded our branch network by both acquiring financial institutions and establishing de novo branches. At December 31, 2006, we operated 119 branches, compared with 37 at December 31, 2001. In addition, we expect to open as many as 5 new branches during 2007. We cannot assure that our ongoing branch expansion strategy will be accretive to our earnings, or that it will be accretive to our earnings within a reasonable period of time. Numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new branch, such as a suitable location, qualified personnel and an effective marketing strategy. Additionally, it takes time for a new branch to gather sufficient loans and deposits to generate enough income to offset its expenses, some of which, like salaries and occupancy expense, are relatively fixed costs. Strong Competition May Limit Our Growth and Profitability. Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than us and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market area. 18 We Operate in a Highly Regulated Environment and May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Laws and Regulations. We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OTS and the FDIC. Such regulators govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on us and our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws rule or regulation, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.
