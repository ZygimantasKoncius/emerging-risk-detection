risk factors, such as total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, is useful in predicting future cardiovascular events. Cassette Products Under Development Products listed under development are undergoing optimization of design, performance testing, scale up, clinical trials, regulatory submissions and transfer to production.  Lipid Profile/Alanine Aminotransferase. We plan to offer a single cassette containing both our CLIA waived lipid profile and ALT tests (Lipid/ALT). The integration of the lipid parameters (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides) and liver function parameter (ALT) will provide convenience and ease of use for our customers. We expect this product to be available in late calendar year 2006. 7 Table of Contents Cassette Products in Feasibility Studies We are in various stages of feasibility studies for new cassettes that would expand our product line for diagnostic testing. We may develop additional tests depending on the progress of our existing development efforts and available resources. Liver Panel  ALT/AST.  Total Bilirubin. The total bilirubin test is a liver function test that is helpful in the differentiation of the cause of jaundice.  Alkaline Phosphatase. Alkaline phosphatase is a group of enzymes that are active at an alkaline pH. Alkaline phosphatase activity is highest in the liver, bone, intestine and kidney and is a useful test of liver function. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase in the blood is for differentiating hepatobiliary disease from osteogenic bone disease. Statin Safety Panel  ALT/AST.  Creatine Kinase. Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme with high levels of enzyme activity in skeletal muscle. Measurement of CK in patients on statin drug therapy is useful for monitoring for damage to skeletal muscle, a rare side effect of statin therapy. Individual Test Cassettes  Direct Low Density Lipoproteins. The direct low density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol test permits the direct measurement of LDL cholesterol in a patient sample. The calculated LDL cholesterol is subject to a number of limitations including the need for a fasting sample. The direct LDL cholesterol test is reimbursable, whereas the calculated test is not. Other Platforms  Vascular Endothelial Dysfunction. The Endo-Pat 2000 is a non-invasive device that is as a diagnostic aid in the detection of coronary artery endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the lining of all the blood vessels and is the site of the development of coronary artery disease. Strategic Relationships We have established and continually seek to develop strategic relationships to enhance the commercialization of our products. In particular, we intend to enter into additional strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical, health promotion and other related companies to enhance our business strategy in the management of chronic diseases. Our current strategic relationships are described below. Distribution We have non-exclusive distribution agreements to market, sell and distribute our products to healthcare providers in the United States, Europe, Latin America and Asia. We believe our partnerships will further our access to medical, occupational health and other health care professionals who seek effective in-office diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring tools for cholesterol and diabetes management. Significant distributors of our products include: Physician Sales and Service, Inc., Henry Schein, Inc., McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., Edwards Medical Supply, and Fisher Scientific International, Inc. 8 Table of Contents Boule Diagnostics In November 2005, we signed a definitive agreement with Boule Diagnostic International Boule, an international manufacturer of hematology systems, headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. Under the terms of the agreement, we will collaborate with Boule on the development and commercialization of a point of care Complete Blood Count (CBC) system, designed for waiver under CLIA. We will receive exclusive distribution rights covering all human applications in the United States and Canada. Itamar Medical In April 2004, we signed a market development and product distribution agreement with Itamar Medical Limited, involving a novel and proprietary system for assessing vascular endothelial dysfunction. Vascular disease experts recognize endothelial dysfunction as an early stage in the development of atherosclerosis. Marketing Programs Our LDX System continues to be utilized in a number of regionally based marketing programs in the United States, including healthcare industry conventions. Our international sales and marketing team continues to work with selected global pharmaceutical companies in connection with country specific marketing programs. Pharmaceutical companies utilizing our LDX System in connection with such programs include AstraZeneca PLC and Pfizer Inc. Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing strategy is to expand our presence in the heart disease and diabetes screening and monitoring markets, focusing primarily on the healthcare professional, pharmaceutical and corporate wellness markets. In order to execute this strategy and create opportunities for our products, we intend to expand our professional sales force and focus our efforts on partnering, distribution and marketing activities. Our sales and marketing strategy includes increasing penetration into the physician office laboratory and health promotion markets and leveraging our installed base of LDX and GDX Analyzers. We plan to dedicate a significant portion of our sales and marketing efforts to educate current and potential customers about the clinical and economic benefits of diagnostic screening and therapeutic monitoring and about new test cassettes as they become available for distribution. In order to support this effort, we have hired representatives who focus on calling our key accounts by phone. We also plan to continue to cultivate strategic relationships with development partners, pharmaceutical companies and distributors. We intend to leverage the technology, customer base, marketing power and distribution networks of these partners to accelerate market penetration and increase cassette usage. Our current marketing activities are primarily focused on:  Physician Office Laboratories. We have entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements with five national medical products distributors, Cardinal Health, Fisher Scientific, McKesson, Physician Sales and Service and Henry Schein, which together have more than 2,500 sales professionals who focus primarily on the United States physician office laboratory (POL) market. We have also retained more than 35 regional distributors in the United States. In addition, we and our distributors focus sales and marketing efforts on physicians whose practices include a high incidence of the cholesterol-related diseases targeted by our test cassettes, including cardiologists, lipid clinicians, internists and family practitioners.  Health Promotion. We have ongoing relationships with approximately 15 regional distributors whose primary focus are to provide equipment and supplies to customers that conduct diagnostic screening for cholesterol and related lipid levels and diabetes. Some of these distributors also sell to the POL market segment.  International. Our international distribution strategy is to penetrate targeted geographical markets by selling directly to distributors in those markets. We have entered into non-exclusive agreements with approximately 35 foreign distributors to distribute the LDX System and cassettes primarily in Europe, Asia and South America. 9 Table of Contents Competition The diagnostic products markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. Our competition consists primarily of clinical and hospital laboratories, as well as manufacturers of bench top analyzers. The substantial majority of diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers are currently performed by clinical and hospital laboratories. We expect that these laboratories will compete aggressively to maintain dominance in the market. To achieve broad market acceptance, we must demonstrate that the LDX System and GDX System are attractive alternatives to bench top analyzers and clinical and hospital laboratories. This will require physicians to change their established means of having such tests performed. There can be no assurance that the LDX System and GDX System will be able to compete with these other analyzers and testing services. Companies with a significant presence in the diagnostic products market, such as Abbott Laboratories, Bayer Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter, Inc. and Roche Diagnostics (a subsidiary of Roche Holdings Ltd.), have developed or are developing analyzers designed for point of care testing. Such competitors also offer broader product lines than us, have greater name recognition than us and offer discounts as a competitive tactic. In addition, several smaller companies are currently making or developing products that compete or will compete with ours. We believe we currently have a competitive advantage due to (i) the status of the LDX System which is waived under CLIA and can provide a complete lipid profile in accordance with the NIH guidelines in less than five minutes using a single drop of blood; (ii) our ALT test, which is the only ALT test waived under CLIA by the FDA and enables physicians to monitor the potential side effects on the liver from cholesterol lowering drugs and other medications; (iii) the improving breadth of the CLIA waived tests that we offer our installed base; and (iv) our network of over 85 distributors. We expect that our competitors will compete actively to maintain and increase market share and will seek to develop multi-analyte tests that qualify for CLIA waiver. Our current and future products must compete effectively with the existing and future products of our competitors primarily on the basis of ease of use, breadth of tests available, market presence, cost effectiveness, accuracy, immediacy of results and the ability to perform tests near the patient, to test multiple analytes from a single sample and to conduct tests without a skilled technician or pre-treating blood. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing, distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future or, if we do have such resources and capabilities, that we will employ them successfully. Manufacturing We manufacture, test, perform quality assurance on, package and ship our products from our approximately 69,000 square foot facility located in Hayward, California. We maintain control of those portions of the manufacturing process that we believe are complex and provide an important competitive advantage.  LDX Analyzer. The LDX Analyzer incorporates a variety of subassemblies and components designed or specified by us, including an optical element, microprocessors, circuit boards, a liquid crystal display and other electrical components. These components and subassemblies are manufactured by a variety of suppliers and are shipped to us for final assembly and quality assurance. Our manufacturing process for the LDX Analyzer consists primarily of assembly, testing, inspection and packaging. Testing consists of a burn-in period, functional tests and integrated system testing using specially produced test cassettes. Our manufacturing process complies with FDA Quality System Requirements, ISO 9001 and TÜV GS Mark guidelines. We believe we can expand our current LDX Analyzer manufacturing capacity as needed.  Cassettes. We purchase chemicals, membranes, plastic parts and other raw materials from suppliers and convert these raw materials, using proprietary processes, into single-use test cassettes. We believe our proprietary processes and custom designed equipment are important components of our cassette manufacturing operations. We have developed core manufacturing technologies, processes and production machinery, including membrane lamination and welding, discrete membrane impregnation, on-line calibration and software control of the manufacturing process. The overall manufacturing process meets FDA Quality System Requirements and in-vitro diagnostic directive, including in process and final quality assurance testing. All our cassette production is currently on our high volume manufacturing line. We use a second manufacturing line for research and development purposes. 10 Table of Contents  Raw Materials and Quality Assurance. Suppliers provide us with the subassemblies, components and raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products. These subassemblies, components and raw materials are inspected and tested by our quality control personnel. We expect the supply of raw materials to be adequate for our current level of business and into the foreseeable future. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities. Certain key components and raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are currently provided by single source vendors and on a purchase order basis. Our quality assurance personnel also perform finished goods quality control and inspection and maintain documentation for compliance with quality systems regulations and other government manufacturing regulations. Patents and Proprietary Technology We have 10 patents in the United States covering various technologies, including the method for separating HDL from other lipoproteins in a dry chemistry format, the basic design of the testing cassette and the LDX Analyzer and the method of correcting for the effects of substances that can interfere with testing of a blood sample that expire between 2009 and 2022. We have filed four additional patent applications in the United States and internationally under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and individual foreign applications. We are also the licensee of United States patents relating to the measurement of Lp(a) and a portion of our cassette technology. Our current products incorporate technologies which are the subject of patents issued to and patent applications filed by others. We have obtained licenses for certain of these technologies and might be required to obtain licenses for others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses for technology patented by others on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, that we will be able to develop alternative approaches if we are unable to obtain licenses or that our current and future licenses will be adequate for the operation of our business. The failure to obtain such licenses or identify and implement alternative approaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In December 2003, we and Roche Diagnostics signed a settlement agreement and a license agreement which settled and dismissed all existing patent litigation between us on a worldwide basis. As part of the settlement, we agreed to pay Roche an ongoing royalty and Roche granted an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to us for its patents related to HDL cholesterol. In addition, the parties also agreed upon a mechanism for the resolution of future patent infringement disputes. We believe that any such dispute resolution will confirm that our HDL cholesterol test cassette, currently under development, does not infringe Roches patents. If however, upon the resolution of any dispute, it is ultimately determined that our new HDL cholesterol test cassette is covered by Roches patents, we will pay Roche the same ongoing royalty. There can be no assurance that patent infringement claims will not be asserted against us by other parties in the future, that in such event we will prevail or that we will be able to obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, or at all. Adverse determinations in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and/or require us to seek licenses from third parties. If we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or are unable to develop or implement alternative technology, we may be unable to manufacture and sell the affected products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We rely substantially on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position. We work actively to foster continuing technological innovation to maintain and protect our competitive position, and we have taken security measures to protect our trade secrets and periodically explore ways to further enhance trade secret security. There can be no assurance that such measures will provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information. Although we have entered into proprietary information agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, there can be no assurance that these agreements will provide adequate remedies for any breach. 11 Table of Contents Government Regulation Food and Drug Administration and Other Regulations The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938, as amended (the FDC Act), the FDA regulates the clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant pre-market clearance or pre-market approval for devices and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by us. In the United States, medical devices are classified into one of three classes, Class I, II or III, on the basis of the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls (e.g., labeling, registration, listing and adherence to quality systems regulations). Class II devices are subject to general controls, pre-market notification and special controls (e.g., performance standards, post-market surveillance and patient registries). Generally, Class III devices are those that must receive pre-market approval from the FDA (e.g., life sustaining, life supporting and implantable devices or new devices which have not been found substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices) and require clinical testing to assure safety and effectiveness. Before a new device can be introduced into the market, the manufacturer must generally obtain marketing clearance through a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the FDC Act or a pre-market approval application under Section 515 of the FDC Act or be exempt from 510(k) requirements. Most Class I devices are exempt from 510(k) requirements. A 510(k) clearance typically will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not called for a pre-market approval. A 510(k) notification must contain information to support a claim of substantial equivalence, which may include laboratory test results or the results of clinical studies of the device in humans. It generally takes from four to 12 months from the date of submission to obtain 510(k) clearance, but it may take longer. A not substantially equivalent determination by the FDA, or a request for additional information, could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category. For any devices that are cleared through the 510(k) process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device will require new 510(k) submissions. We obtained 510(k) clearance before marketing the LDX Analyzer and all existing test cassettes in the United States. In general, we intend to develop and market tests that will receive 510(k) clearance. However, if we cannot establish that a proposed test cassette is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, we will be required to seek pre-market approval of the proposed test cassette from the FDA through the submission of a pre-market approval application. If a future product were to require submission of this type of application, regulatory approval of such product would involve a much longer and more costly process than a 510(k) clearance. We do not believe that our products under development will require the submission of a pre-market approval application, which can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. A FDA review of a pre-market approval application generally takes one to three years from the date it is accepted for filing, but may take significantly longer. Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA clearance or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experience with the use of the device. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Current FDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. The FDC Act regulates our quality control and manufacturing procedures by requiring us and our contract manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with quality systems regulations. The FDA monitors compliance with these requirements by requiring manufacturers to register with the FDA, which subjects them to periodic inspections. We were inspected by the FDA in 2002 as part of a routine quality system audit. The State of 12 Table of Contents California also regulates and inspects our manufacturing facilities. We have been inspected twice by the State of California to date and are manufacturing under an issued medical device manufacturers facility license from the State of California. If any violations of our applicable regulations are noted during a FDA, European Notified Body or State of California inspection of our manufacturing facilities or those of our contract manufacturers, the continued marketing of our products could be materially adversely affected. The European Union (EU) has promulgated rules that require that devices such as ours receive the right to affix the CE mark, a symbol of adherence to applicable EU directives. We have completed all the testing necessary to comply with applicable regulations to currently be eligible for self certification. While we intend to satisfy the requisite policies and procedures that will permit us to continue to affix the CE mark to our products in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in meeting EU certification requirements. Failure to receive the right to affix the CE mark may prohibit us from selling our products in EU member countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We and our products are also subject to a variety of state and local laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed. Any applicable state or local laws or regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities. For example, eight states have regulations that impose requirements on pharmacies and/or pharmacists that perform clinical testing, four of which have regulations that prohibit certain pharmacy-based testing. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies could increase the cost of or otherwise adversely affect our ability to comply with regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, 1988 The use of our products in the United States is subject to CLIA, which provides for federal regulation of laboratory testing, an activity also regulated by most states. Laboratories must obtain either a Certificate of Waiver or a registration certificate (for moderately complex testing) from CMS. Some states may require a state license also. The CLIA regulations seek to ensure the quality of medical testing. The three primary mechanisms to accomplish this goal are daily quality control requirements to ensure the accuracy of laboratory devices and procedures, proficiency testing to measure testing accuracy and personnel standards to assure appropriate training and experience for laboratory workers. CLIA categorizes tests as waived, or as being moderately complex or highly complex on the basis of specific criteria. To successfully commercialize tests that are currently under development, we believe it will be critical to obtain waived classification for such tests under CLIA, because CLIA waiver allows healthcare providers to use the LDX System with fewer requirements and at a lower cost. Third Party Reimbursement In the United States, healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians that purchase products such as the LDX System and single-use test cassettes generally rely on third party payors, including private health insurance plans, federal Medicare, state Medicaid and managed care organizations, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the product is being used. Our ability to commercialize our products successfully in the United States will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of tests performed with the LDX System and related treatment will be available from government health authorities, private health insurers and other third party payors. For example, provisions for cholesterol and diabetes screening were included in the federal Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, which was implemented in January 2005. Third party payors can affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement provided by such payors for testing services. Reimbursement is currently not available for certain uses of our products in particular circumstances. Pharmacists also face blocking state legislation in a number of states, which precludes them from accessing federally available reimbursement codes and practices. Third party 13 Table of Contents payors are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Decreases in reimbursement amounts for tests performed using our products may decrease amounts physicians and other practitioners are able to charge patients, which in turn may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In addition, certain healthcare providers are moving toward a managed care system in which such providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per patient. Managed care providers are attempting to control the cost of healthcare by authorizing fewer elective procedures, such as the screening of blood for chronic diseases. We are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third party payors. The inability of healthcare providers to obtain reimbursement from third party payors, or changes in third party payors policies toward reimbursement of tests using our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the United States in recent years, there can be no assurance that currently available levels of reimbursement will continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development. In 1991, the Health Care Finance Administration adopted regulations providing for the inclusion of capital related costs in the prospective payment system for hospital inpatient services under which most hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare on a per diagnosis basis at fixed rates unrelated to actual costs, based on diagnostic related groups. Under this system of reimbursement, equipment costs generally are not reimbursed separately, but rather are included in a single, fixed rate, per patient reimbursement. Medicare reform legislation requires CMS to implement a prospective payment system for outpatient hospital services as well. This system may also provide for a per-patient fixed rate reimbursement for outpatient department capital costs. We believe these regulations place more pressure on hospitals operating margins, causing them to limit capital expenditures. These regulations could have an adverse effect on us if hospitals decide to defer obtaining medical equipment as a result of any such limitation on their capital expenditures. The Medicare legislation also requires CMS to adopt uniform coverage and administration policies for laboratory tests. We are unable to predict what adverse impact on us, if any, additional government regulations, legislation or initiatives or changes by other payors affecting reimbursement or other matters that may influence decisions to obtain medical equipment may have. We believe the escalating cost of medical care and services has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of care and services, including products offered by us. In addition, market acceptance of our products in international markets is dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country, and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance. There can be no assurance in either domestic or foreign markets that third party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate, that current reimbursement amounts will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. Product Liability and Insurance The sale of our products entails risk of product liability claims. The medical testing industry has historically been litigious, and we face financial exposure to product liability claims if use of our products results in personal injury. We also face the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall. There can be no assurance that we will not experience losses due to product liability claims or recalls in the future. We currently maintain product liability insurance, but there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate. Such insurance is expensive, difficult to obtain and no assurance can be given that product liability insurance can be maintained in the future on acceptable terms, or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability, or at all. An inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability could prevent or inhibit the continued commercialization of our products. In addition, a product liability claim in excess of relevant insurance coverage or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have liability insurance covering our property and operations with coverage, deductible amounts and exclusions, which we believe are customary for companies of our size in our industry. However, there can be no 14 Table of Contents assurance that our current insurance coverage is adequate or that we will be able to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against liability. Employees As of March 31, 2006, we employed 212 full-time associates. There were 89 employees in manufacturing, 55 employees in sales and marketing, 40 employees in administration and 28 employees in research and development. None of our associates are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management considers relations with employees to be excellent.

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS The reader should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties we describe below, as well as all of the other information in this report. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties which we are currently unaware of or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely affect our business. We have a history of operating losses and fluctuating operating results, which may result in the market price of our common stock declining Our revenue and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. As of March 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of $19.1 million. We recorded a net profit of $5.6 million for fiscal year 2006, a net profit of $4.1 million for fiscal year 2005, and a net profit of $8.7 million for fiscal year 2004. The following are some of the factors that could cause our revenue, operating results and margins to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter:  the timing and level of market acceptance of the LDX System and the GDX System;  manufacturing problems, efficiencies, capacity constraints or delays; 16 Table of Contents  the timing of the introduction, availability and market acceptance of new tests and products;  changes in demand for our products based on changes in third-party reimbursement policies, changes in government regulation and other factors;  product pricing and discounts;  the timing and level of expenditures associated with research and development activities;  the timing, establishment and maintenance of strategic distribution arrangements and the success of the activities conducted under such arrangements;  the timing of significant orders from, and shipments to, customers;  competition from diagnostic companies with greater financial capital and resources;  costs and timing associated with business development activities, including potential licensing of technologies or intellectual property rights;  additions or departures of our key personnel;  promotional program spending by both domestic and European pharmaceutical companies;  variations in the mix of products sold;  litigation or the threat of litigation; and  Adoption of new accounting standards, such as SFAS 123R. These and other factors are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Fluctuations in quarterly demand for our products may cause our manufacturing operations to fluctuate in volume, increase uncertainty in operational planning and/or affect cash flows from operations. We commit to many of our expenses in advance, based on our expectations of future business needs. These costs are largely fixed in the short-term. As a result, when business levels do not meet expectations, our fixed costs will not be recovered and we will experience losses. This situation is likely to result in the future because of the variability and unpredictability of our revenue. This also means that our results will likely not meet the expectations of public market security analysts or investors at one time or another, which may result in the market price of our common stock declining. Our business depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology through patents and other means and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others Our success depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We have ten United States patents, one German patent and have filed patent applications relating to our technology internationally under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and individual foreign patent applications. The risks of relying on the proprietary nature of our technology include:  our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, or, if issued, such patents may not offer protection against competitors with similar technology;  our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future, and the rights created under our patents may not provide a competitive advantage;  competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than us and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may seek to apply for and obtain patents covering technologies that are more effective than ours. This could render our technologies or products obsolete or uncompetitive or could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products either in the United States or in international markets;  the medical products industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights; and 17 Table of Contents  an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings conducted in the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine the priority of inventions. Litigation may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, patent interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming and will likely result in substantially diverting the attention of technical and management personnel from our business operations. We may also be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies regarding the development and sale of our products and operation of our business. For example, in fiscal year 2004, we entered into a settlement agreement and license agreement with Roche, which settled all existing patent litigation between the parties on a worldwide basis. As a part of the settlement, we pay Roche an ongoing royalty and Roche granted an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to us for its patents related to HDL cholesterol. In addition, the parties also agreed upon a mechanism for the resolution of future patent infringement disputes. We believe that any such dispute resolution will confirm that our HDL cholesterol test cassette, currently under development, does not infringe Roches patents. If however, upon the resolution of any such dispute, it is ultimately determined that our new HDL cholesterol test cassette is covered by Roches patents, we will pay Roche the same ongoing royalty. We rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology. We may also be unable to adequately protect our trade secrets, or be capable of protecting our rights to our trade secrets. We depend on technology that we license from others, which may not be available to us in the future and would prevent us from introducing new products and harm our business Our current products incorporate technologies that are the subject of patents issued to, and patent applications filed by, others. We have obtained licenses for certain of these technologies. We may in the future be required to negotiate to obtain licenses for new products. Some of our current licenses are subject to rights of termination and may be terminated. Our licensors may not abide by their contractual obligations and, as a result, may limit the benefits we currently derive from their licenses. We may be unable to renegotiate or obtain licenses for technology patented by others on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We also may be unable to develop alternative approaches if we are unable to obtain licenses. Our future licenses may also not be adequate for the operation of our business. Failure to obtain, maintain or enforce necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or to identify and implement alternative approaches could prevent us from introducing our products and severely harm our business. Our stock price has been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors The market price of our common stock has in the past been, and in the future is likely to be, highly volatile. For example, between March 26, 2005 and March 31, 2006, the price of our common stock, as reported on the NASDAQ National Market System, has ranged from a low of $7.95 to a high of $13.19. These fluctuations could result in substantial losses for investors. Our stock price may fluctuate for a number of reasons including:  quarterly variations in our operating results;  litigation or threat of litigation;  developments in or disputes regarding patent or other proprietary rights;  announcements of technological or competitive developments by us and our competitors;  regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors; 18 Table of Contents  changes in the current structure of the healthcare financing and payment systems;  our failure to achieve, or changes in, financial estimates by securities analysts and comments or opinions about us by securities analysts or major shareholders;  stock market price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for medical products and high technology companies and which are often unrelated to the operating performance of such companies; and  general economic, political and market conditions. With the advent of the internet, new avenues have been created for the dissemination of information. We do not have control over the information that is distributed and discussed on electronic bulletin boards and investment chat rooms. The motives of the people or organizations that distribute such information may not be in our best interest or in the interest of our shareholders. This, in addition to other forms of investment information, including newsletters and research publications, could result in a significant decline in the market price of our common stock. In addition, stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices for diagnostic product companies have been affected by these market fluctuations and such effects have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock. This type of litigation has been brought against us in the past and could be brought against us in the future, which could result in substantial expense and damage awards and divert managements attention from running our business. If third-party reimbursement for use of our products is eliminated or reduced, our sales will be greatly reduced and our business may fail In the United States, healthcare providers that purchase products such as the LDX System and the GDX System generally rely on their patients healthcare insurers, including private health insurance plans, federal Medicare, state Medicaid and managed care organizations, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the product is being used. We will be unable to successfully market our products if their purchase and use is not subject to reimbursement from government health authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. If this reimbursement is not available or is limited, healthcare providers will be much less likely to use our products, our sales will be greatly reduced and our business may fail. There are current conditions in the healthcare industry that increase the possibility that third-party payors may reduce or eliminate reimbursement for tests using our products in certain settings. These conditions include:  third-party payors are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging the prices charged for both existing and new medical products and services;  healthcare providers are moving toward a system in which employers are requiring participants to bear a greater burden of the cost of their healthcare benefits which could result in fewer elective procedures, such as the use of our products for diagnostic screening;  general uncertainty regarding what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third-party payors and how that will affect the use of products such as ours, which may deter healthcare providers from adopting the use of our products; and  an overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare industry, both domestic and international, to reduce the cost of products and services, including products offered by us. Market acceptance of our products in international markets is also dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement or funding, as the case may be, within prevailing healthcare systems. Reimbursement, funding and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government 19 Table of Contents sponsored healthcare and private insurance. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, and current reimbursement or funding amounts may be decreased in the future. Also, future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. Any of these events could materially harm our business. If the healthcare system in the United States undergoes fundamental change, these changes may harm our business We believe that the healthcare industry in the United States is likely to undergo fundamental changes due to current political, economic and regulatory influences. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems. Potential alternatives include mandated basic healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. We expect legislative debate to continue in the future and for market forces to demand reduced costs. We cannot predict what impact the adoption of any federal or state healthcare reform measures, future private sector reform or market forces may have on our business. Any changes in the healthcare system could potentially have extremely negative effects on our business. We depend on distributors to sell our products and failure to successfully maintain these relationships could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue To increase revenue and achieve sustained profitability, we will have to successfully maintain our existing distribution relationships and develop new distribution relationships. We depend on our distributors to assist us in promoting market acceptance of the LDX System and the GDX System. However, we may be unable to enter into and maintain new arrangements on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we do enter into additional distributor relationships, those distributors may not devote the resources necessary to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products. In addition, our distributors sell products offered by our competitors. If our competitors offer our distributors more favorable terms or have more products available to meet their needs or utilize the leverage of broader product lines sold through the distributor, those distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In addition, our distributors order decision-making process is complex and involves several factors, including end-user demand, warehouse allocation and marketing resources, which can make it difficult to accurately predict total sales for the quarter until late in the quarter. In order to keep our products included in distributors marketing programs, in the past we have provided promotional goods or made short-term pricing concessions. The discontinuation of promotional goods or pricing concessions could have a negative effect on our business. Our distributors could also modify their business practices, such as payment terms, inventory levels or order patterns. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with distributors or expand our distribution channels or we experience unexpected changes in payment terms, inventory levels or other practices by our distributors, our business will suffer. We may be unable to accurately predict future sales through our distributors, which could harm our ability to efficiently manage our internal resources to match market demand Our product sales are primarily made through our network of over 85 domestic and international distributors. As a result, our financial results, quarterly product sales, trends and comparisons are affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of end-user customers and our distributors, and by the changes in inventory levels of our products held by these distributors. We have only limited visibility over the inventory levels of our products held by our domestic and international distributors. While we attempt to assist our distributors in maintaining targeted stocking level of our products, we may not consistently be accurate or successful. This process involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties including end-user customer demand, and the reaction of our distributors to our new quarterly pricing policy. Consequently, actual results could differ from our estimates. Inventory levels of our products held by our distributors may exceed or fall below the levels we consider desirable on a going-forward basis, which may harm our financial results due to unexpected buying patterns of our 20 Table of Contents distributors or our ability to efficiently manage or invest in internal resources, such as manufacturing and shipping capacity, to meet the actual demand for our products. We may be unable to effectively compete against other providers of diagnostic products, which could cause our sales to decline The market for diagnostic products in which we operate is intensely competitive. Our business is based on the sale of diagnostic products that physicians and other healthcare providers can administer in their own facilities without sending samples to laboratories. Thus, our competition consists primarily of clinical reference laboratories and hospital-based laboratories that use automated testing systems, as well as manufacturers of other rapid diagnostic tests. To achieve and maintain market acceptance for the LDX System and the GDX System, we must demonstrate that the LDX System and the GDX System are cost effective and time saving alternatives to other rapid diagnostic tests as well as to clinical and hospital laboratories. Even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective and save time, physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing their established source of such tests. The LDX System and the GDX System may be unable to compete with these other testing services and analyzers. In addition, companies with a significant presence in the market for clinical diagnostics, such as Abbott Laboratories, Bayer Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter, Inc. and Roche Diagnostics (a subsidiary of Roche Holdings, Ltd.) have developed or are developing analyzers designed for point of care testing. These competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than us. These competitors also offer broader product lines than us, have greater name recognition than us and offer discounts as a competitive tactic. In addition, several smaller companies are currently making or developing products that compete or will compete with ours. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing, distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future. Even if we do have such resources and capabilities, we may not employ them successfully. Our LDX System, including the LDX Analyzer and single use test cassettes, currently accounts for substantially all of the revenue of our business. If this revenue does not grow, our overall business will be severely harmed. For us to increase revenue, sustain profitability and maintain positive cash flows from operations, the LDX System and the GDX System must continue to and begin to gain market acceptance among healthcare providers, particularly physician office laboratories. We have made only limited sales of the LDX System to physician office laboratories to date relative to the size of the available market. Factors that could prevent broad market acceptance of the LDX System and the GDX System include:  low levels of awareness of the availability of our technology in both the physician and other customer groups;  the availability and pricing of other testing alternatives;  a decrease in the amount of reimbursement for performing tests on the LDX System and the GDX System.  many managed care organizations have contracts with laboratories, which require participating or employed physicians to send patient specimens to contracted laboratories; and  physicians are under growing pressure by Medicare and other third-party payors to limit their testing to medically necessary tests. If our LDX System does not achieve broader market acceptance and our GDX System does not achieve favorable market acceptance, our business will not grow. Even if we are successful in continuing to place our LDX Analyzer at physician office laboratories and other near-patient testing sites and marketing our GDX System, there can be no assurance that placement of these products will result in sustained demand for our single use test cassettes and single use test cartridges. In addition, we must leverage our installed base of systems in order to increase the sales of our single use test cassettes and single use test cartridges. If we are unable to increase the usage of cassettes on our current installed base, we will have to identify new customers and induce them to purchase an analyzer, which requires more time and effort and has a significantly larger purchase price than the single use test cassettes. 21 Table of Contents As a result of these many hurdles to achieving broad market acceptance for the LDX System and the GDX System, demand may not be sufficient to sustain revenue and profits from operations. Because the LDX System currently contributes the vast majority of our revenue, and we expect the GDX System to contribute a portion of our revenue in the future, we could be required to cease operations if the LDX System and the GDX System do not achieve and maintain a significant level of market acceptance. If we do not successfully develop, acquire or form alliances to introduce and market new tests and products, our future business will be harmed We believe our business will not grow significantly if we do not develop, acquire or form alliances for new tests and products to use in conjunction with the LDX System and the GDX System. If we do not develop market and introduce new tests and products to the market, our business will not grow significantly and will be harmed. Developing new tests involves many significant problems and risks, including:  research and development is a very expensive process;  research and development takes a very long time to result in a marketable product;  significant costs (including diversion of resources) may be incurred in development before knowing if the development will result in a test that is commercially viable;  a new test will not be successful unless it is effectively marketed to its target market;  the manufacturing process for a new test must be reliable, cost efficient and high volume and must be developed and implemented in a timely manner to produce the test for sale;  new tests must meet a significant market need to be successful; and  new tests must obtain proper regulatory approvals to be marketed. We could experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new tests and products. For example, regulatory clearance or approval of any new tests or products may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. We have experienced difficulties obtaining regulatory approval for tests in the past. Because the evaluation of applications by the FDA for CLIA waived status is not based on precisely defined, objectively measurable criteria, we cannot predict the likelihood of obtaining CLIA waived status for future products. In addition, our business strategy includes entering into agreements with clinical and commercial collaborators and other third parties for the development, clinical evaluation and marketing of existing products and products under development. These agreements may be subject to rights of termination and may be terminated without our consent. The parties to these agreements also may not abide by their contractual obligations to us and may discontinue or sell their current lines of business. Research performed under a collaboration for which we receive or provide funding may not lead to the development of products in the timeframe expected, or at all. If these agreements are terminated earlier than expected, or if third parties do not perform their obligations to us properly and on a timely basis, we may not be able to successfully develop new products as planned, or at all. We face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes We manufacture all of the single use test cassettes that are used with the LDX Analyzer. The manufacture of single use test cassettes is a highly complex and precise process that is sensitive to a wide variety of factors. Significant additional resources, implementation of additional manufacturing equipment or changes in our manufacturing processes have been, and may continue to be, required for the scaling-up of each new product prior to commercialization or in order to meet increasing customer demand once commercialization begins, and this work may not be completed successfully or efficiently. In the past, we have experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields that have adversely affected gross margins and delayed product shipments. If we do not maintain acceptable manufacturing yields of test cassettes or experience product shipment delays, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of test cassettes because of:  raw materials variations or impurities; 22 Table of Contents  human error;  manufacturing process variances and impurities; and  decreased manufacturing equipment performance. Our LDX manufacturing equipment and cassette manufacturing lines would be costly and time consuming to repair or replace if their operation were interrupted. The interruption of our manufacturing operations or the loss of associates dedicated to the manufacturing facility could severely harm our business. The risks involving our manufacturing lines include:  as our production levels increase, we could be required to use our machinery more hours per day and the down time resulting from equipment failure could increase;  the custom nature of much of our manufacturing equipment increases the time required to remedy equipment failures and replace equipment;  we have a limited number of associates dedicated to the operation and maintenance of our manufacturing equipment, the loss of whom could impact our ability to effectively operate and service such equipment;  we manufacture all of our cassettes at our Hayward, California manufacturing facility, so manufacturing operations are at risk to interruption from earthquake, fire, power outages or other events affecting this one location; and  our newest manufacturing line is operating at production capability. Our failure to maintain production levels and operate this line at production capability for an extended period would impact our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity. Our operating results may suffer if we do not reduce our manufacturing costs We believe we will be required to reduce manufacturing costs for new and existing test cassettes to achieve sustained profitability. We currently manufacture the majority of our dry chemistry cassettes on a single production line. A second manufacturing line is currently used for overflow production and for research and development purposes. The complexity and custom nature of our manufacturing process increases the amount of time and money required to add an additional manufacturing line. In addition, we may need to implement additional cassette manufacturing cost reduction programs. Failure to maintain full production levels for our newest manufacturing line could prevent us from satisfying customer orders in a timely manner, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of business and a failure to reduce manufacturing costs for dry chemistry tests, which could prevent us from achieving sustained profitability. Our future results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international sales Historically, a significant portion of our total revenue has been generated outside of the United States. International revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately 13% in fiscal year 2006 and 14% in fiscal year 2005. We anticipate that international revenue will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future. Our revenue is generally denominated in United States dollars; however, a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and, as a result, our future revenue from international operations may be unpredictable. We make foreign currency denominated purchases related to our GDX System in the United Kingdom. This exposes us to risks associated with currency exchange fluctuations. In addition to foreign currency risks, our international sales and operations may also be subject to the following risks:  our dependency on pharmaceutical companies promotional programs as a primary source of international revenue;  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  the impact of recessions in economies outside the United States; 23 Table of Contents  changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging nations;  less effective protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;  changes in tariffs and other trade protection measures;  difficulties in managing international operations; and  potential insolvency of international distributors and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods. If we are unable to minimize the foregoing risks, they may harm our current and future international sales and, consequently, our business. We depend on single source suppliers for certain materials used in our manufacturing process and failure of our suppliers to provide materials to us could harm our business We currently depend on single source vendors to provide certain subassemblies, components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. We also depend on a third-party manufacturer for the GDX System. Any supply interruption in a single sourced material or product could restrict our ability to manufacture and distribute products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. We may not be successful in qualifying additional sources of supply on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to obtain a usable alternative source or product could prevent us from manufacturing and distributing our products, resulting in inability to fill orders, customer dissatisfaction and loss of business. This would likely severely harm our business. In addition, an uncorrected impurity or suppliers variation in material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could interfere with our ability to manufacture and distribute products. Because we are a small customer of many of our suppliers and we purchase their subassemblies, components and materials with purchase orders instead of long-term commitments, our suppliers may not devote adequate resources to supplying our needs. Any interruption or reduction in the future supply of any materials currently obtained from single or limited sources could severely harm our business. We rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial part of our revenue Sales to a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in each fiscal period. We expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue in future periods. Our top ten customers comprised approximately 66% of our revenue in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2006, Physicians Sales and Service accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenue, Henry Schein Inc. accounted for approximately 11% and McKesson Medical Surgical accounted for approximately 7% of our total revenue. In fiscal year 2005, Physicians Sales and Service accounted for approximately 24% of our total revenue, Henry Schein Inc. accounted for approximately 9% and McKesson Medical Surgical accounted for approximately 7% of our total revenue. We have experienced periods in which sales to some of our major customers, as a percentage of total revenue, have fluctuated due to delays or failures to place expected orders. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers, who generally purchase our products pursuant to cancelable short-term purchase orders. If we were to lose a major customer or if orders by or shipments to a major customer were to otherwise decrease or be delayed, our operating results would be harmed. While we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate internal control over financial reporting Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and to devote additional resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In addition, it is difficult for us to predict how long it will take to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting each year and we may not be able to 24 Table of Contents complete the process on a timely basis. In the event that internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our shares will be affected. In addition, if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control or if we were to discover material weaknesses in our internal control systems, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud and it could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our products are subject to multiple levels of government regulation and any regulatory changes are difficult to predict and may be damaging to our business The manufacture and sale of our diagnostic products, including the LDX System and the GDX System, is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. We are unable to commence marketing or commercial sales in the United States of any of the new tests we develop until we receive the required clearances and approvals. The process of obtaining required regulatory clearances and approvals is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. As a result, our new tests under development, even if successfully developed, may never obtain such clearance or approval. Additionally, certain material changes to products that have already been cleared or approved are subject to further review and clearance or approval. Medical devices are subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a cleared product may result in restrictions on the products marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market. If we lose previously obtained clearances, or fail to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements, we may be unable to market the affected products, which would depress our revenue and severely harm our business. In addition, any future amendment or addition to regulations impacting our products could prevent us from marketing the LDX System and the GDX System. Regulatory changes could hurt our business by increasing burdens on our products or by reducing or eliminating certain competitive advantages of the LDX Systems and the GDX Systems waived status. Food and Drug Administration clearance or approval of products such as ours can be obtained by either of two processes:  the 510(k) clearance process, which generally takes from four to 12 months but may take longer; and  the pre-market approval process, which is a longer and more costly process than a 510(k) clearance process, involves the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information and generally takes one to three years but may take significantly longer. If our future products are required to obtain a pre-market approval, this would significantly delay our ability to market those tests and significantly increase the costs of development. The use of our products and those of our competitors is also affected by federal and state regulations, which provide for regulation of laboratory testing, as well as by the laws and regulations of foreign countries. The scope of these regulations includes quality control, proficiency testing, personnel standards and inspections. In the United States, clinical laboratory testing is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1976. The LDX Analyzer, our total cholesterol, high density lipoproteins, triglycerides and glucose tests in any combination, our ALT test cassette, the GDX Analyzer and A1C test cartridges have been classified as waived from the application of many of the requirements under the CLIA. We believe this waived classification is critical for our products to be successful in their domestic markets. Any failure of our new tests to obtain waived status under the CLIA will severely limit our ability to commercialize such tests. Loss of waived status for existing diagnostic products or failure to obtain waived status for new products could limit our revenue from sales of such products, which would severely harm our business. We may face fines or our manufacturing facilities could be closed if we fail to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations Our manufacturing processes and, in certain instances, those of our contract manufacturers, are subject to stringent federal, state and local regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in many things, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial 25 Table of Contents suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant pre-market clearance or pre-market approval for devices, withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution. Any of these developments could harm our business. We and our contract manufacturers are also subject to federal, state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture of healthcare products and diagnostic devices, including:  Quality System Regulations, which requires manufacturers to be in compliance with Food and Drug Administration regulations;  ISO9001/EN46001 requirements, which is an industry standard for maintaining and assuring conformance to quality standards; and  other foreign regulations and state and local health, safety and environmental regulations, which include testing, control and documentation requirements. Changes in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products or require us to incur significant costs to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations, which could harm our business. We may pursue strategic acquisitions which could have an adverse impact on our business if they are unsuccessful We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and we may pursue product, technology or business acquisitions. These acquisitions could be very costly, could result in dilution to existing investors and could result in integration problems that harm our business as a whole. Any acquisition could result in expending significant amounts of cash, issuing potentially dilutive equity securities or incurring debt or unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business. In addition, our acquisitions may not be successful in achieving our desired strategic objectives, which could materially harm our operating results and business. Acquisitions may also result in difficulties in assimilating the operations, technologies, products, services and personnel of the acquired company or business or in achieving the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated. These difficulties could result in additional expenses, diversion of management attention and an inability to respond quickly to market issues. Any of these results could harm us financially. If we are successful in growing sales, our business will be harmed if we cannot effectively manage the operational and management challenges of growth If we are successful in achieving and maintaining market acceptance for the LDX System and the GDX System, we will be required to expand our operations, particularly in the areas of sales, marketing and manufacturing. As we expand our operations, this expansion will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain on our management, operating and financial systems and resources. To accommodate any such growth and compete effectively, we will be required to implement and improve our information systems, procedures and controls, and to expand, train, motivate and manage our work force. Our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. Any failure to implement and improve operational, financial and management systems or to manage our work force as required by future growth, if any, could harm our business and prevent us from improving our financial condition as a result of increased sales. Our business could be negatively affected by the loss of key personnel or our inability to hire qualified personnel Our success depends in significant part on the continued service of certain key scientific, technical, regulatory and managerial personnel. Our success will also require us to continue to identify, attract, hire and retain additional highly qualified personnel in those areas. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our industry. We may be unable to retain our key personnel or attract or retain other necessary highly qualified personnel in the future, which would harm the development of our business. 26 Table of Contents Product liability and professional liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates Sale and use of our products and the past performance of testing services by our formerly wholly owned subsidiary could lead to the filing of a product liability or professional liability claim. If any of these claims are brought, we may have to expend significant resources defending against them. If we are found liable for any of these claims, we may have to pay damages that could severely hurt our financial position. Loss of these claims could also hurt our reputation, resulting in our losing business and market share. The medical testing industry has historically been litigious, and we face financial exposure to these liability claims if use of our products results in personal injury or improper diagnosis. We also face the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall. We currently maintain product liability insurance and professional liability insurance for claims relating to the past performance of testing services, but there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate. Insurance is expensive and difficult to obtain, and we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. Inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability could prevent or inhibit the continued commercialization of our products. In addition, a product liability or professional liability claim in excess of relevant insurance coverage or a product recall could severely harm our financial condition. We may need additional capital in the future to support our growth, and such additional funds may not be available to us We intend to expend substantial funds for capital expenditures and working capital related to research and development, expansion of sales and marketing activities and other working capital and general corporate purposes. Although we believe our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flow anticipated to be generated by future operations and available bank borrowings under an existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future, we may still require additional financing. For example, we may be required to expend greater than anticipated funds if unforeseen difficulties arise in expanding manufacturing capacity for existing cassettes or in the course of completing required additional development, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, obtaining waived status under CLIA or introducing or scaling up manufacturing for new tests. If we need additional capital in the future, we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, collaborative relationships or other arrangements. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing shareholders or have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. If we raise additional capital through borrowings, the terms of such borrowings may impose limitations on how our management may operate the business in the future. Collaborative arrangements, if necessary to raise additional funds, may require us to relinquish our rights to technologies, products or marketing territories. Our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could prevent us from developing our products and our business. We have made use of a device to limit the possibility that we are acquired, which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders. To date, our board of directors has designated 25,000 shares as Series A participating preferred stock in connection with our poison pill anti-takeover plan. The issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock. The poison pill may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors. The poison pill may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation, purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the poison pill. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
