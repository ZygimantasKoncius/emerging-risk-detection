Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects OPERATING RESULTS Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2010 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2009 Sony realigned its reportable segments from the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 to reflect its reorganization as of April 1, 2009, primarily repositioning operations previously reported within the Electronics and Game segments and establishing the Consumer Products & Devices (CPD), Networked Products & Services (NPS) and B2B & Disc Manufacturing (B2B & Disc) segments. The CPD segment includes products such as televisions, digital imaging, audio and video, semiconductors and components. The equity earnings of S-LCD Corporation (S-LCD) are also included within the CPD segment. The NPS segment includes the game business as well as PCs and other networked businesses. The B2B & Disc segment is comprised of the B2B business, including broadcast- and professional-use products, as well as Blu-ray Disctm, DVD and CD disc manufacturing. Additionally, Music is a new reportable segment effective from the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. The Music segment includes Sony Music Entertainment (SME), Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. (SMEJ), and a 50 percent owned U.S.-based joint venture in the music publishing business, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC (Sony/ATV). Pictures and Financial Services continue to be reportable segments. The equity earnings from Sony Ericsson Mobile Communication AB (Sony Ericsson) are presented as a separate segment. In connection with this realignment, both the sales and operating income (loss) of each segment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 have been revised to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2009 2010 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,730.0 7,214.0 6.7 % Equity in net loss of affiliated companies (25.1 ) (30.2 )  Operating income (loss) (227.8 ) 31.8  Income (loss) before income taxes (175.0 ) 26.9  Net loss attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders (98.9 ) (40.8 )  34 Table of Contents Sales Sales and operating revenue (sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 516.0 billion yen, or 6.7 percent compared to the previous fiscal year (year-on-year), to 7,214.0 billion yen, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in sales in the CPD segment, partially offset by an increase in revenue in the Financial Services segment. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, the average rate of the yen was 91.8 yen against the U.S. dollar and 129.7 yen against the euro, which was 8.4 percent and 9.5 percent higher, respectively, year-on-year. Sales in the analysis of the ratio of cost of sales to sales, the ratio of research and development costs to sales, and the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales (which excludes financial service revenue). This is because Financial service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated financial statements. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 767.9 billion yen, or 13.6 percent year-on-year, to 4,892.6 billion yen, and improved from 78.5 percent to 76.7 percent as a percentage of sales. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) decreased by 65.3 billion yen, or 13.1 percent year-on-year to 432.0 billion yen. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 6.8 percent compared to 6.9 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 141.1 billion yen, or 8.4 percent year-on-year, to 1,544.9 billion yen, mainly due to the impact of the appreciation of the yen and a decrease in advertising and publicity expenses. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased year-on-year from 23.4 percent to 24.2 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 43.0 billion yen, compared with a loss of 38.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This loss was primarily due to impairment charges including a 27.1 billion yen charge related to the impairment of LCD television assets*, a 7.8 billion yen charge related to the impairment of the small- and medium-sized amorphous thin film transistor (TFT) LCD fixed assets and other less significant losses on the sale, disposal or impairment of assets. These charges were partially offset by gains on the sales of assets including a 22.0 billion yen gain recognized from the sales of equity interests in HBO Latin America and HBO Central Europe. The loss recorded in the previous fiscal year was primarily the result of impairment charges including long-lived asset impairments mainly due to the downsizing and withdrawal from certain businesses as well as goodwill impairment charges. Refer to Notes 18 and 20 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. * The 27.1 billion yen loss on impairment, a non-cash charge recorded within operating income, primarily reflects a decrease in the estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets. Managements strategic plans updated in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 resulted in decreases in the assets estimated service periods and corresponding estimated future cash flows leading to the impairment charge. Sony has excluded the loss on impairment from restructuring charges as it is not directly related to Sonys ongoing restructuring initiatives. Sony defines restructuring initiatives as activities initiated by Sony, such as exiting a business or product category or implementing a headcount reduction program, which are designed to generate a positive impact on future profitability. Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Affiliated Companies Equity in net loss of affiliated companies, recorded within operating income, was 30.2 billion yen, an increased loss of 5.1 billion yen year-on-year. Sony recorded equity in net loss for Sony Ericsson of 34.5 billion yen compared to equity in net loss of 30.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income for S-LCD, a joint venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.(Samsung), decreased by 6.5 billion yen year-on-year to 0.4 billion yen. 35 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was 31.8 billion yen, an improvement of 259.6 billion yen year-on-year. Operating results improved significantly primarily due to an improvement in operating results in the Financial Services segment, as well as an improvement in the cost of sales ratio and a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses mainly in the CPD segment. For a further breakdown of operating income (loss) for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, other income decreased by 55.0 billion yen, or 55.6 percent, to 43.8 billion yen, while other expenses increased by 2.7 billion yen, or 5.9 percent year-on-year, to 48.7 billion yen. The net amount of other income and other expenses was an expense of 4.9 billion yen, a deterioration of 57.7 billion yen year-on-year, primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss of 10.9 billion yen that was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of 48.6 billion yen that was recorded in the previous fiscal year. A net foreign exchange loss was recorded mainly due to losses related to the period end valuation on derivative contracts entered into by Sony for the purpose of effective global cash management. Interest and dividends in other income of 13.2 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, a decrease of 9.1 billion yen, or 40.9 percent year-on-year. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in interest received resulting from a lower rate of return on investments in Japan and the U.S. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, interest recorded in other expenses totaled 22.5 billion yen, a decrease of 1.9 billion yen, or 7.7 percent year-on-year. Income (Loss) before Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, income before income taxes of 26.9 billion yen was recorded, an improvement of 201.9 billion yen year-on-year, mainly as a result of the above-noted improvement in operating results. Income Taxes During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony recorded 14.0 billion yen of income taxes resulting in an effective tax rate of 51.9 percent. This effective tax rate was higher than the Japanese statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of equity investments reported net of income taxes, partially offset by lower effective tax rates on profits in the insurance business of the Financial Services segment. In the previous fiscal year, Sony recorded 72.7 billion yen of income tax benefit resulting in an effective tax rate of 41.6 percent. This income tax benefit was mainly due to a loss before income taxes and the partial reversal of certain deferred tax liabilities for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, due to a change in the tax regulations in Japan to treat 95 percent of the dividends from overseas subsidiaries as non-taxable income, partially offset by the impact of equity in net loss reported net of income taxes, the reversal of certain deferred tax assets, and an increase in valuation allowance. Net Income (loss) attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, net loss attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders, which excludes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was 40.8 billion yen, a 58.1 billion yen improvement year-on-year. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 53.8 billion yen was recorded, as compared to net loss of 3.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This was mainly due to the income recorded at Sony Financial Holdings, Inc. (SFH), for which there is a noncontrolling interest of 40 percent, primarily as a result of the improvement in net valuation gains from investments in convertible bonds in the general account at Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Sony Life) due to the improved situation in the Japanese stock market. 36 Table of Contents Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders were both 40.66 yen compared with net loss per share of 98.59 yen in the previous fiscal year. Refer to Note 22 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 27 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Sales to outside customers decreased 18.8 percent compared with the prior fiscal year. This was primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, a decrease in sales of LCD televisions due to a decline in unit selling prices and a decrease in sales of home-use video cameras and compact digital cameras due to the contraction of these markets. 37 Table of Contents Operating loss of 46.5 billion yen was recorded, an improvement of 68.6 billion yen year-on-year. This was driven by an improvement in the cost of sales ratio, mainly of LCD televisions, and a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit due to lower sales, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in restructuring charges. Restructuring charges were 72.0 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, which includes 7.3 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets, compared with 49.3 billion yen of restructuring charges recorded in the prior fiscal year. Depreciation associated with restructured assets refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, a 27.1 billion yen non-cash charge related to the impairment of LCD television assets, which was not included in restructuring charges, was also recorded. (Refer to Note 18 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.) Products contributing to the improvement in operating results (excluding restructuring charges) include LCD televisions and compact digital cameras, reflecting the benefits of cost reduction activities that exceeded the impact of the decrease in sales, and images sensors, that saw an increase in sales. This was partially offset by lower operating results for system LSIs for the game business which were affected by lower sales resulting from price reductions driven by cost saving efforts. No additional provision or reversal of expenses relating to voluntary notebook computer battery pack recalls and the subsequent global replacement program, and free repair expenses relating to Sony products and the products of other companies containing Sony-made charged coupled devices (CCDs) was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, and the remaining balance of the provision as of March 31, 2010 was not significant.

Sales in the game business decreased year-on-year mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, decreases in unit sales of PSP®(PlayStation®Portable) (PSP) hardware and of PlayStation®2 (PS2) software. These decreases were partially offset by increased unit sales of PlayStation®3 (PS3) software, driven by the expanded PS3 platform as a result of the launch of a new model. Operating loss of 83.1 billion yen was recorded, an improvement of 4.4 billion yen year-on-year. This was driven by an improvement in the cost of sales ratio, mainly of PS3 hardware, and a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in gross profit due to lower sales. Products contributing to the improvement in operating results (excluding restructuring charges) include flash memory digital audio players. On the other hand, operating results in the game business deteriorated mainly due to lower unit sales of PS2 software and of PSP hardware, partially offset by cost reductions in PS3 hardware and increased unit sales of PS3 software. Below are the sales to outside customers by product category, unit sales of each platform within the Game category, and unit sales of major products within the PC and Other Networked Businesses category: Sales to outside customers by product category Figures in parentheses indicate the percentage contribution of each product category to the segment total.

Sales to outside customers decreased 13.0 percent year-on-year. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in sales of broadcast- and professional-use products in developed countries reflecting deterioration in the business environment. Unit selling price declines in the disc manufacturing business also contributed to the decrease in overall segment sales. Operating loss of 7.2 billion yen was recorded compared to operating income of 6.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This was due to deterioration in the profitability of broadcast- and professional-use products and in the disc manufacturing business brought on by the factors noted above. Total for the CPD, NPS and B2B & Disc Segments Inventory Total Inventory for the CPD, NPS and B2B & Disc segments, as of March 31, 2010, was 570.0 billion yen, which represents a 174.3 billion yen, or 23.4 percent decrease compared with the level as of March 31, 2009, mainly due to company-wide efforts to maintain appropriate levels of inventory and to improve working capital. Sales to Outside Customers by Geographic Area Regarding sales to outside customers by geographic area for the CPD, NPS and B2B & Disc segments, total combined sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 7 percent in Japan, 18 percent in the U.S., 25 percent in Europe, and 11 percent in non-Japan Asia and other geographic areas (Other Areas). In Japan, sales of products such as LCD televisions increased while sales of products and services in the game business, products such as portable audio, system LSI, chemical products*, and broadcast- and professional-use products decreased. In the U.S., sales of products such as LCD televisions and products and services in the game business decreased. In Europe, sales of products such as LCD televisions, products and services in the game business and home-use video cameras decreased. In Other Areas, sales of products such as PCs increased while sales of products such as LCD televisions, compact digital cameras, products and services in the game business and home-use video cameras decreased. * Chemical products include materials and components for electronic devices such as circuit boards and adhesives. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Approximately 45 percent of the CPD, NPS, B2B & Disc segments combined total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 took place in Japan, including the production of compact digital cameras, home-use video cameras, LCD televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and storage media. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other countries. China accounted for approximately 20 percent of total annual production, approximately 65 percent of which was destined for other countries. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for approximately 15 percent of total annual production, with approximately 50 percent destined for Japan, the Americas and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for approximately 20 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Pictures Pictures segment results presented below are a yen-translation of the results of Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), a U.S.-based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Management analyzes the results of SPE in U.S. dollars, so discussion of certain portions of its results is specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 12.3 billion yen, or 1.7 percent year-on-year, to 705.2 billion yen primarily due to the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 increased by approximately 7 percent. Motion picture revenues, also on a 40 Table of Contents U.S. dollar basis, increased by approximately 5 percent year-on-year, primarily due to higher worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues from the current years film slate which included strong performances from 2012, Angels & Demons and Michael Jacksons This Is It. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment revenues from prior years films. Television revenues, on a U.S. dollar basis, increased by approximately 9 percent year-on-year, primarily due to higher advertising revenues from several international channels, including a significant increase in India from the broadcasting of the Indian Premier League cricket competition. Operating income increased by 12.9 billion yen, or 43.1 percent year-on-year, to 42.8 billion yen. Operating income increased by approximately 53 percent on a U.S. dollar basis. This increase was primarily from the sale of a portion of SPEs equity interest in a Latin American premium pay television business (HBO Latin America) and a U.S. cable network (Game Show Network), as well as the sale of all of its equity interest in a Central European premium pay television business (HBO Central Europe). The total gain recognized from these sales was 30.3 billion yen. The benefit from these gains was partially offset by the decrease in home entertainment revenues noted above and the write-off of certain development costs. As of March 31, 2010, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future, having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year in which the product is made available for broadcast. Music Music segment results presented below include the yen-translated results of SME, a U.S.-based operation which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis, the results of SMEJ, a Japan-based music company which aggregates its results in yen, and the yen-translated consolidated results of Sony/ATV, a 50 percent owned U.S.-based consolidated joint venture in the music publishing business which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 increased by 135.6 billion yen, or 35.0 percent year-on-year, to 522.6 billion yen. The increase was mainly due to the fact that results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 include the full year results of SME, which was consolidated as a wholly-owned subsidiary beginning October 1, 2008 upon Sonys acquisition of Bertelsmann AGs 50 percent interest. On a pro forma basis, had SME been fully consolidated for the previous fiscal year, sales in the Music segment for the previous fiscal year would have been 549.1 billion yen. Compared with these pro forma sales, Music segment sales decreased 5 percent year-on-year, primarily due to the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. On a U.S. dollar basis, when comparing the full year results for SME to the full year results for the previous fiscal year on a pro forma basis, sales for SME increased by 2 percent. The increase in sales primarily reflects the favorable impact of new releases and strong sales of Michael Jackson catalog product, partially offset by the continued decline of the physical music market. In addition to Michael Jacksons catalog albums, best-selling new releases during the fiscal year included Susan Boyles I Dreamed a Dream, the Michael Jacksons This Is It soundtrack, Alicia Keys The Element of Freedom and Glee the Music Vol.1 & 2, music collections from the hit U.S. television show, Glee. Sales at SMEJ included contributions from Michael Jacksons catalog albums and ikimono-gakaris HAJIMARI NO UTA. Operating income increased by 8.7 billion yen, or 31.1 percent year-on-year, to 36.5 billion yen. Operating income for the previous fiscal year included equity in net loss of 6.0 billion yen for SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT (SONY BMG) through October 1, 2008. On a pro forma basis, had SME been fully consolidated for the previous fiscal year, operating income for the Music segment would have been 21.3 billion yen. Compared to this pro forma operating income, Music segment operating income increased 72 percent year-on-year. The increase in the pro-forma segment results is primarily due to improved results from SME and SMEJ. On a U.S. dollar basis, when comparing the full year results for SME to the full year results for the previous year on a pro forma basis, operating income for SME increased by 487 percent, primarily due to the contribution 41 Table of Contents from hit releases, Michael Jackson catalog product sales, growth in new music related businesses as well as a year-on-year decrease in overhead and restructuring costs. SMEJs contribution to operating income increased mainly due to the contribution from hit releases as well as year-on-year decreases in advertisement expenses and restructuring charges. Financial Services The results of Sony Life discussed below on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) differ from the results that SFH and Sony Life disclose separately on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial services revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 increased by 313.2 billion yen, or 58.2 percent year-on-year to 851.4 billion yen mainly due to an increase in revenue at Sony Life. Revenue at Sony Life was 740.4 billion yen, a 309.9 billion yen or 72.0 percent increase year-on-year. Revenue increased significantly year-on-year mainly due to an improvement in net gains from investments in the separate account, an improvement in net valuation gains from investments in convertible bonds in the general account and a significant decrease in impairment losses on equity securities in the general account, all as a result of the significant rise in the Japanese stock market in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, as compared with a significant decline following the global financial crisis in the previous fiscal year. Revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life increased, reflecting a steady increase in policy amount in force. Operating income of 162.5 billion yen was recorded, compared to an operating loss of 31.2 billion yen in the previous fiscal year mainly as a result of a significant improvement in operating results at Sony Life. Operating income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 at Sony Life was 166.6 billion yen, as compared to an operating loss of 29.8 billion in the previous fiscal year, mainly due to the improvement in net valuation gains from investments in convertible bonds in the general account, a decrease in the provision of policy reserves because of the revision of the future investment yield of variable life insurance products in the separate account and the significant decrease in impairment losses on equity securities in the general account, all as a result of the improved situation in the Japanese stock market mentioned above. Information of Operations Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of operations for the Financial Services segment alone and for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Financial Services segment 2009 2010 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 538,206 851,396 Financial service expenses 567,567 687,559 Equity in net loss of affiliated companies (1,796 ) (1,345 ) Operating income (loss) (31,157 ) 162,492 Other income (expenses), net 28 (966 ) Income (loss) before income taxes (31,129 ) 161,526 Income taxes and other (6,922 ) 54,721 Net income (loss) attributable to Sony Corporations Stockholders (24,207 ) 106,805 42 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Sony without the Financial Services segment 2009 2010 (Yen in millions) Net sales and operating revenue 7,212,492 6,381,094 Costs and expenses 7,387,236 6,484,642 Equity in net loss of affiliated companies (23,313 ) (28,890 ) Operating loss (198,057 ) (132,438 ) Other income (expenses), net 58,254 1,836 Loss before income taxes (139,803 ) (130,602 ) Income taxes and other (61,219 ) (34,081 ) Net loss attributable to Sony Corporations Stockholders (78,584 ) (96,521 ) Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Consolidated 2009 2010 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 523,307 838,300 Net sales and operating revenue 7,206,686 6,375,698 7,729,993 7,213,998 Costs and expenses 7,932,667 7,151,991 Equity in net loss of affiliated companies (25,109 ) (30,235 ) Operating income (loss) (227,783 ) 31,772 Other income (expenses), net 52,828 (4,860 ) Income (loss) before income taxes (174,955 ) 26,912 Income taxes and other (76,017 ) 67,714 Net loss attributable to Sony Corporations Stockholders (98,938 ) (40,802 ) Sony Ericsson Sony Ericssons operating results are accounted for under the equity method and are not consolidated in Sonys consolidated financial statements, as Sony Corporations ownership percentage of Sony Ericsson is 50 percent. Sony Ericsson aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a euro basis. However, Sony believes that the following disclosure provides additional useful analytical information to investors regarding Sonys operating performance. Pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Sony Ericssons financial statements are included in this Annual Report on Form 20-F on pages (A-1 to A-27) . Sales for the year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 3,821 million euro, or 37.2 percent year-on-year, to 6,457 million euro, mainly driven by significantly lower unit shipments as a result of continued challenging market conditions in all regions. A total of 53.0 million units were shipped for the year ended March 31, 2010, compared to 88.8 million units for the prior year. Despite the significantly lower sales, the loss before taxes increased only slightly by 21 million euro year-on-year to 654 million euro, primarily due to a reduction in research and development expenses as well as selling and administrative expenses. As a result, Sony recorded equity in the net loss of Sony Ericsson of 34.5 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, compared to a loss of 30.3 billion yen in the prior fiscal year. 43 Table of Contents All Other Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 56.6 billion yen, or 17.8 percent year-on-year, to 261.9 billion yen. The decrease in sales is mainly due to a significant decrease in sales at a mobile phone third-party original equipment manufacturing (OEM) business in Japan, partially offset by an increase in sales at So-net Entertainment Corporation (So-net). In terms of operating performance, operating loss for All Other increased by 0.6 billion yen year-on-year, to a loss of 4.8 billion yen. This increase was mainly due to charges related to the withdrawal from the property management operation of an entertainment complex in Japan and the termination payments of the property lease contract, partially offset by an increase in operating income at a mobile phone OEM business in Japan. Restructuring As the global economy experienced a sharp downturn following the autumn of 2008, the operating environment for Sony has become severe, with decreased demand, intensified pressure on pricing, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In an attempt to cope with this environment, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony continued to implement restructuring initiatives to reform its operational structure with a priority on profitability and speed. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 124.3 billion yen, which includes 7.9 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets, compared to 75.4 billion yen of restructuring charges recorded in the previous fiscal year. There were no non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets in the previous fiscal year. Of the total 124.3 billion yen incurred in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, 65.1 billion yen were personnel-related costs. This charge was included primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, Sony either consolidated or sold five manufacturing sites in Japan and five manufacturing sites outside of Japan during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Restructuring charges were recorded mainly in the CPD segment, and All Other and Corporate. In the CPD segment, restructuring charges amounted to 72.0 billion yen, which includes 7.3 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, compared to 49.3 billion yen of restructuring charges recorded in the previous year. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, restructuring activities included headcount reduction programs, initiatives to advance rationalization of manufacturing operations, shifting and aggregating manufacturing to lower-cost countries and utilizing the services of OEMs and third-party original design manufacturing (ODMs). In the CPD segment, most of the 35.9 billion yen of restructuring charges incurred within selling, general and administrative expenses were personnel-related costs. In the TV business, Sony ceased manufacturing operations at its Sony EMCS Corporation Ichinomiya TEC in June 2009, and at Sony Baja California, S.A. de C.V.s Mexicali factory in September, 2009 and sold to the Hon Hai Group approximately 90 percent of Sonys ownership interest in Sony Baja California and certain manufacturing assets related to LCD televisions at Sony Baja Californias Tijuana Factory in Mexico in January 2010, which mainly manufactures LCD televisions for the Americas region. The Tijuana Factory remains a key manufacturing facility of Sony LCD televisions for the Americas region. In all segments, excluding the CPD segment, and All Other and Corporate, restructuring charges were recorded mainly due to headcount reductions through early retirement programs. Restructuring charges discussed in Item 5, which include non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets, are described in Note 18 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, the average value of the yen was 91.8 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 129.7 yen against the euro, which was 8.4 percent and 9.5 percent higher, respectively, year-on-year. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations largely because the currency used in the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order 44 Table of Contents to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated or anticipated by Sony Corporation and by its subsidiaries transactions and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. Sony Global Treasury Services Plc (SGTS) in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges most of the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of these transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycles for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment. In the Financial Services segment, Sony uses derivatives for Asset Liability Management (ALM) and trading. To minimize the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the CPD and NPS segments, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in other income and expenses. The notional amount and the net fair value of all the foreign exchange derivative contracts as of March 31, 2010 were 2,026.4 billion yen and a liability of 13.2 billion yen, respectively. Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2009 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2008 Sony realigned its segments from the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 to reflect the companys reorganization as of April 1, 2009. In connection with this realignment, both the sales and operating income (loss) of each segment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 and in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 have been revised to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2008 2009 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 8,871.4 7,730.0 −12.9 % Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies 100.8 (25.1 )  Operating income (loss) 475.3 (227.8 )  Income (loss) before income taxes 567.1 (175.0 )  Net income (loss) attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders 369.4 (98.9 )  45 Table of Contents Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 1,141.4 billion yen, or 12.9 percent year-on-year, to 7,730.0 billion yen primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in sales in the CPD and NPS segments. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, the average value of the yen was 99.5 yen against the U.S. dollar and 142.0 yen against the euro, which was 13.8 percent and 12.7 percent higher, respectively, year-on-year. Sales in the analysis of the ratio of cost of sales to sales, the ratio of research and development costs to sales, and the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales (which excludes financial service revenue). This is because Financial Service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated financial statements. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 629.5 billion yen, or 10.0 percent year-on-year, to 5,660.5 billion yen, and increased from 75.6 percent to 78.5 percent as a percentage of sales. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 23.3 billion yen, or 4.5 percent year-on-year, to 497.3 billion yen. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 6.9 percent compared to 6.3 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 28.4 billion yen, or 1.7 percent, year-on-year to 1,686.0 billion yen, mainly due to the impact of the appreciation of the yen, partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges, primarily consisting of personnel-related costs. The overall ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased year-on-year from 20.6 percent to 23.4 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 38.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, compared with a 37.8 billion yen gain on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the previous fiscal year. This loss was primarily the result of impairment charges including long-lived asset impairments mainly as a result of the downsizing and withdrawal from certain businesses as well as goodwill impairment charges. The gain recorded in the previous fiscal year was primarily from a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 60.7 billion yen and a gain on the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin of 10.0 billion yen. Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Affiliated Companies Equity in net loss of affiliated companies, recorded within operating income, was 25.1 billion yen, a deterioration of 125.9 billion yen year-on-year. Sony recorded equity in net loss for Sony Ericsson of 30.3 billion yen, compared to equity in net income of 79.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year, primarily as a result of a less favorable product mix and price pressure, a decrease in unit shipments due to the global economic slowdown, as well as the recording of restructuring charges. Equity in net income for S-LCD, a joint-venture with Samsung, decreased 0.5 billion yen compared with the prior fiscal year to 6.9 billion yen. Sony also recorded equity in net loss of 6.0 billion yen for SONY BMG, as opposed to equity in net income of 10.0 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Operating Income (Loss) Operating loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 was 227.8 billion yen, compared with operating income of 475.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. The CPD segment, the NPS segment, the Financial Services segment and Sony Ericsson mainly contributed to the operating loss. For a further breakdown of operating income (loss) for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. 46 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, other income decreased by 50.6 billion yen, or 33.9 percent, to 98.8 billion yen, while other expenses decreased by 11.6 billion yen, or 20.2 percent year-on-year, to 46.0 billion yen. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 52.8 billion yen, a decrease of 39.0 billion yen, or 42.5 percent year-on-year. This decrease is mainly due to the recording of a gain of 81.0 billion yen for the change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees as a result of the global initial public offering of shares of SFH in connection with the listing of shares on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the previous fiscal year. Interest and dividends in other income of 22.3 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, a decrease of 12.0 billion yen, or 34.9 percent year-on-year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, interest recorded in other expenses totaled 24.4 billion yen, an increase of 1.4 billion yen, or 6.3 percent year-on-year. In addition, net foreign exchange income of 48.6 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, a year-on-year increase of 43.0 billion yen. Net foreign exchange income was recorded due to the value of the yen, during the first through third quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, appreciating against other currencies from the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts were entered into by Sony to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated or anticipated by Sony Corporation and by its subsidiaries transactions and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. Income (Loss) before Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, a loss before income taxes of 175.0 billion yen was recorded, compared to income of 567.1 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Income Taxes During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony recorded an income tax benefit amounting to 72.7 billion yen resulting in an effective tax rate of 41.6 percent. This is mainly due to a loss before income taxes during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 and the partial reversal of certain deferred tax liabilities amounting to 55.5 billion yen for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, due to a change in the tax regulations in Japan to treat 95 percent of the dividends from overseas subsidiaries as non-taxable income, partially offset by the impact of the inclusion of equity in net loss of affiliated companies into net loss before income taxes and minority interest, the reversal of certain deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits at Sony Corporation and an increase in valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards at certain subsidiaries. Net Income (Loss) attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders Net loss attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, which excludes net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, was 98.9 billion yen, compared with net income of 369.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of 3.3 billion yen was recorded, a 2.5 billion yen decrease year-on-year. This was mainly due to the loss recorded at SFH which was negatively impacted by the increase in net valuation losses from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities at Sony Life. Basic net loss per share attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders was 98.59 yen, compared with basic net income per share attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders of 368.33 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net loss per share attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders was 98.59 yen, compared with diluted net income per share attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders of 351.10 yen in the previous fiscal year. 47 Table of Contents Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Business Segment Information Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2008 2009 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue Consumer Products & Devices 4,914.0 4,031.5 −18.0 % Networked Products & Services 2,120.7 1,755.6 −17.2 B2B & Disc Manufacturing 614.9 560.0 −8.9 Pictures 857.9 717.5 −16.4 Music 228.7 387.1 +69.3 Financial Services 581.1 538.2 −7.4 All Other 359.5 318.4 −11.4 Corporate and Elimination (805.4 ) (578.3 )  Consolidated 8,871.4 7,730.0 −12.9 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2008 2009 Percent change (Yen in billions) Operating income (loss) Consumer Products & Devices 230.1 (115.1 )  % Networked Products & Services (77.6 ) (87.4 )  B2B & Disc Manufacturing 64.5 6.5 −90.0 Pictures 58.5 29.9 −48.9 Music 35.1 27.8 −20.6 Financial Services 22.6 (31.2 )  Equity in net loss of Sony Ericsson 79.5 (30.3 )  All Other 10.3 (4.2 )  Sub-Total 423.0 (203.9 )  Corporate and Elimination 52.3 (23.9 )  Consolidated 475.3 (227.8 )  Consumer Products & Devices Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 882.5 billion yen, or 18.0 percent year-on-year, to 4,031.5 billion yen. Sales to outside customers decreased 15.1 percent compared with the prior fiscal year. This decrease was mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, deterioration in the business environment brought on by the slowing global economy, and the intensification of price competition. With regard to products within the CPD segment, while LCD televisions saw higher sales due to increased unit sales, sales decreased significantly for products such as home-use video cameras and compact digital cameras. The absence of the previous years sales of LCD rear-projection televisions and CRT televisions, both businesses that Sony has exited, also contributed to the decrease in sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Operating loss of 115.1 billion yen was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, compared to income of 230.1 billion yen for the previous fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency 48 Table of Contents exchange rates, the higher cost of sales ratio due to intensified price competition, a decrease in sales due to deterioration in the business environment and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due to higher restructuring charges. Restructuring charges were 49.3 billion yen compared with 33.6 billion yen recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Products contributing to the significant decrease in the operating results included compact digital cameras, LCD televisions and home-use video cameras. Additionally, a portion of the provision of the 51.2 billion yen charges recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 related to notebook computer battery pack recalls and the subsequent global replacement program totaling 2.3 billion yen was reversed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, compared to 15.7 billion yen reversed in the previous fiscal year, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. An additional provision was recorded during the previous fiscal year for free repair expenses relating to Sony products and the products of other companies containing Sony-made CCDs, but there was no such provision recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Below are the sales to outside customers by product category and unit sales of major product categories: Sales to outside customers by product category Figures in parentheses indicate the percentage contribution of each product category to the segment total.

Sales to outside customers decreased 17.5 percent compared with the prior fiscal year. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in sales in the game business and of PCs. Sales in the game business decreased year-on-year, primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in unit sales of PS2 hardware and software. PCs sales decreased mainly due to a decline in unit selling prices and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates despite an increase in unit sales. Operating loss of 87.4 billion yen was recorded, a deterioration of 9.8 billion yen year-on-year, mainly due to a deterioration in operating results in PCs, while operating results in the game business improved. 49 Table of Contents The deterioration in operating results for PCs was mainly due to a decline in unit selling price and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. In the game business, the improvement in the operating results was mainly due to PS3 hardware cost reductions and increased PS3 software sales despite the impact of the decrease in sales in the PS2 hardware and software. Below are the sales to outside customers by product category, unit sales of each platform within the Game category, and unit sales of major products within the PC and Other Networked Businesses category: Sales to outside customers by product category Figures in parentheses indicate the percentage contribution of each product category to the segment total.

Sales to outside customers decreased 13.5 percent year-on-year. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in sales of broadcast- and professional-use products in developed countries reflecting deterioration in the business environment brought on by the slowing global economy. Unit selling price declines in the disc manufacturing business also contributed to the decrease in overall segment sales. 50 Table of Contents Operating income decreased 58.1 billion yen, or 90.0 percent year-on-year, to 6.5 billion yen. This decrease was primarily due to deterioration in the profitability of broadcast- and professional-use products and in the disc manufacturing business brought on by the factors noted above. Total for the CPD, NPS and B2B & Disc Segments Inventory Total inventory for the CPD, NPS and B2B & Disc segments, as of March 31, 2009, was 744.3 billion yen. Sales to Outside Customers by Geographic Area Regarding sales to outside customers by geographic area within the CPD, NPS and B2B & Disc segments, total combined sales decreased by 13 percent in Japan, 20 percent in the U.S., 18 percent in Europe, and 11 percent in Other Areas. In Japan, sales of products such as Blu-ray Disc recorders increased while sales of products such as CCDs and CMOS image sensors, PCs and sales at a contactless integrated circuit card business decreased. In the U.S., sales of products and services in the game business and products such as compact digital cameras and PCs decreased. In Europe, sales of products such as digital SLR cameras increased while sales of products and services in the game business and products such as home-use video cameras and PCs decreased. In Other Areas, sales of products such as LCD televisions increased while sales of products such as CRT televisions, a business from which Sony has already withdrawn, home-use video cameras, compact digital cameras and home audio systems decreased. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Approximately 45 percent of the CPD, NPS, B2B & Disc segments combined total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 took place in Japan, including the production of compact digital cameras, home-use video cameras, LCD televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and memory sticks. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other countries. China accounted for approximately 15 percent of total annual production, approximately 70 percent of which was destined for other countries. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for approximately 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 50 percent destined for Japan, the Americas and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for approximately 25 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Pictures Pictures segment results presented below are a yen-translation of the results of SPE, a U.S.-based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Management analyzes the results of SPE in U.S. dollars, so discussion of certain portions of its results is specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 140.4 billion yen, or 16.4 percent year-on-year, to 717.5 billion yen. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment decreased by approximately 360.7 million U.S. dollars (approximately 5 percent) year-on-year. Motion picture revenues decreased primarily due to lower home entertainment revenues of new release and catalog product. This decrease was due to an accelerated contraction in the market, brought on principally by the global economic downturn as well as fewer films being sold into the home entertainment market. The decrease in motion picture sales was partially offset by higher theatrical revenues driven by the successful film slate for fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, which included Hancock, Quantum of Solace and Paul Blart: Mall Cop. Total home entertainment revenues decreased by approximately 500 million U.S. dollars while theatrical revenues increased by approximately 266 million U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 in the Pictures segment also benefited from the sale of a bankruptcy claim against KirchMedia GmbH & Co. KGaA (KirchMedia), a former licensee of motion picture and television product. Television revenues increased by approximately 101 million U.S. dollars year-on-year due to increased advertising revenue from several international channels. 51 Table of Contents Operating income decreased by 28.6 billion yen, or 48.9 percent year-on-year, to 29.9 billion yen and the operating margin decreased from 6.8 percent to 4.2 percent. On a U.S. dollar basis, operating income decreased by approximately 234.0 million U.S. dollars (approximately 43 percent) year-on-year. Operating income for the segment decreased primarily due to the lower home entertainment revenues and the absence of the previous fiscal years sale of the bankruptcy claim against KirchMedia. Operating income from motion picture product decreased by approximately 139 million U.S. dollars reflecting the negative impact of the lower home entertainment revenues. Operating income from television product increased by approximately 70 million U.S. dollars reflecting the benefit of the higher advertising revenues noted above as well as higher equity income, partially due to the gain recorded by an equity affiliate from the sale of a European cable television channel. Results for the fiscal year were also negatively impacted by 53 million U.S. dollars of restructuring charges. As of March 31, 2009, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year in which the product is made available for broadcast. Music Music segment results presented below include the yen-translated results of SME, a U.S.-based operation which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis, the results of SMEJ, a Japan-based music company which aggregates its results in yen, and the yen-translated consolidated results of Sony/ATV, a 50 percent owned U.S.-based consolidated joint venture in the music publishing business which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 increased by 158.4 billion yen, or 69.3 percent year-on-year, to 387.1 billion yen. The increase in sales is mainly due to the consolidation of SME on October 1, 2008. During the six-month period ended March 31, 2009, sales at SME were 169.3 billion yen. On a pro forma basis, this represents a 16 percent decrease on a U.S. dollar basis compared with the same six months of the previous fiscal year when sales of SME were not consolidated. Revenues were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the accelerated decline of the worldwide physical music market resulting from the global economic slowdown. Best selling albums that contributed to sales during the six months ended March 31, 2009 included AC/DCs Black Ice, Beyoncés I AM... SASHA FIERCE, P!nks Funhouse and Britney Spears Circus. Sales at SMEJ decreased year-on-year, mainly due to a decrease in album sales resulting from a continuing decline in the physical music market. SMEJs best-selling albums during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 included I LOVED YESTERDAY by YUI, My song Your song by ikimono-gakari and VOICE by Mika Nakashima. Operating income decreased by 7.2 billion yen, or 20.6 percent year-on-year, to 27.8 billion yen. Operating income for the segment decreased primarily due to lower results for both SME and SMEJ. The results of SME for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 include equity in net loss of SONY BMG of 6.0 billion yen for the six-months ended September 30, 2008 and operating income for the six-month period ended March 31, 2009 of 13.7 billion yen, which totaled 7.7 billion yen of operating income on a combined basis for the full fiscal year. In comparison, the previous years results included 10.0 billion yen of equity in net income for Sonys then 50 percent share of SONY BMG. On a pro forma basis, the 13.7 billion yen operating income for the six-month period ended March 31, 2009 represents a 30 percent decrease compared to the operating income for the comparable period of the previous fiscal year when the results of SONY BMG were not consolidated. This decrease was due to lower sales, higher restructuring charges and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income at SMEJ decreased approximately 10 percent year-on-year, mainly due to a decrease in album sales. 52 Table of Contents Financial Services The results of Sony Life discussed below on the basis of U.S. GAAP differ from the results that SFH and Sony Life disclose separately on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial service revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 42.9 billion yen, or 7.4 percent year-on-year, to 583.2 billion yen due to a decrease in revenue at Sony Life. Revenue at Sony Life was 430.5 billion yen, a 33.5 billion yen or 7.2 percent decrease year-on-year. Revenue decreased year-on-year due to an increase of net valuation losses from convertible bonds and an increase of impairment losses on equity securities in the general account and an increase of net losses from investments in the separate account, as a result of a decline in the Japanese stock market during this fiscal year that was larger than the decline in the previous fiscal year. Partially offsetting this was an increase in revenue from insurance premiums reflecting a higher policy amount in force. Operating loss of 31.2 billion yen was recorded compared to operating income of 22.6 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This decrease was mainly due to a deterioration in profitability at Sony Life. The operating loss at Sony Life was 29.8 billion yen, compared to operating income of 11.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This deterioration of profitability was mainly due to increased net valuation losses from convertible bonds and impairment losses on equity securities in the general account and the additional recording of policy reserves for variable life insurance products in the separate account, as a result of the significant decline in the Japanese stock market. This increase in losses more than offset the contribution from increased revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life. Information of Operations Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of operations for the Financial Services segment alone and for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

Sony Ericsson aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a euro basis. However, Sony believes that the following disclosure provides additional useful analytical information to investors regarding Sonys operating performance. Sony Ericssons sales for the year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 2,415 million euro or 19.0 percent year-on-year, to 10,278 million euro, mainly due to lower volumes as a result of the global economic slowdown. A total of 88.8 million units were shipped during the year ended March 31, 2009 compared to 103.9 million units during the prior year. A loss before taxes of 633 million euro was recorded, compared to income of 1,405 million euro in the previous year, primarily due to a less favorable product mix and price pressure, a decrease in unit shipments, as well as the recording of restructuring charges. As a result, Sony recorded equity in the net loss of 30.3 billion yen for the year ended March 31, 2009, compared to equity in net income of 79.5 billion yen for the previous year. 54 Table of Contents All Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, sales within All Other were comprised mainly of a mobile phone OEM business in Japan and So-net. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 41.0 billion yen, or 11.4 percent year-on-year, to 318.4 billion yen. The decrease in sales is mainly due to a year-on-year decrease in sales at a mobile phone OEM business in Japan, partially offset by an increase in sales at So-net compared with the prior fiscal year. In terms of operating performance, operating income for All Other decreased by 14.6 billion yen year-on-year, to a loss of 4.2 billion yen. This decrease was mainly due to the absence of a 10.0 billion yen gain on the sale of the urban entertainment complex The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Germany, recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 and due to losses attributed to a goodwill impairment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. This decrease was partially offset by a significant increase in operating income at a mobile phone OEM business in Japan and a slight increase in the operating income of So-net. Restructuring As the global economy experienced a sharp downturn following the autumn of 2008, the operating environment for Sony has become severe, with decreased demand, intensified pressure on pricing, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In an attempt to cope with this environment, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony implemented restructuring initiatives to reform its operational structure with a priority on profitability and speed. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony incurred 75.4 billion yen of restructuring charges, mainly within the CPD segment, compared with 47.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Of the 75.4 billion yen in restructuring charges, 56.4 billion yen was for personnel-related restructuring costs. In the CPD segment, restructuring charges were 49.3 billion yen compared with 33.6 billion yen recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Restructuring efforts undertaken in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 included headcount reduction programs, initiatives to advance rationalization of manufacturing operations, shifting and aggregating manufacturing to lower cost countries and utilizing the services of OEMs and ODMs. As part of its restructuring efforts, Sony ceased production in February 2009 at Sony Technology Center  Pittsburgh, United States (where LCD televisions were manufactured), and in April 2009 at Sony France S.A.  Dax Technology Center (where tape and other recording media were manufactured). As part of the above restructuring measures, Sony has undergone several headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs within its CPD segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded in the CPD segment restructuring charges related mainly to employee termination benefits totaling 37.9 billion yen in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, the average value of the yen was 99.5 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 142.0 yen against the euro, which was 13.8 percent and 12.7 percent higher, respectively, year-on-year. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations largely because the currency used in the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated or anticipated by Sony Corporation and by its subsidiaries transactions and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. SGTS in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should 55 Table of Contents enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges most of the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of these transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycles for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment. In the Financial Services segment, Sony uses derivatives for ALM and trading. To minimize the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the CPD and NPS segments, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in other income and expenses. The notional amount and the net fair value of all the foreign exchange derivative contracts as of March 31, 2009 were 1,951.0 billion yen and a liability of 4.5 billion yen, respectively. Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Assets Total assets as of March 31, 2010 increased by 852.6 billion yen, or 7.1 percent year-on-year, to 12,866.1 billion yen. Total assets as of March 31, 2010 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 151.9 billion yen, or 2.4 percent year-on-year, to 6,522.8 billion yen. Total assets as of March 31, 2010 in the Financial Services segment increased by 671.5 billion yen, or 11.4 percent year-on-year, to 6,577.1 billion yen. Current Assets Current assets as of March 31, 2010 increased by 512.2 billion yen, or 14.1 percent year-on-year, to 4,132.9 billion yen. Current assets as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 277.9 billion yen, or 9.8 percent, to 3,119.3 billion yen. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased 419.9 billion yen, or 74.3 percent year-on-year, to 984.9 billion yen. This was primarily due to an increase in operating cash flow as a result of the improvement in net income (loss) attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders and lower purchases of manufacturing equipment and lower investment levels. Refer to Cash Flows below. Notes and accounts receivable, trade (net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns) as of March 31, 2010, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased 40.5 billion yen, or 4.8 percent year-on-year, to 887.7 billion yen. Other current assets as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased 182.7 billion yen, or 12.8 percent, year-on-year to 1,243.3 billion yen, mainly due to a decrease in inventory. Inventories as of March 31, 2010 decreased by 167.6 billion yen, or 20.6 percent, year-on-year to 645.5 billion yen primarily due to company-wide reduction efforts. 56 Table of Contents The inventory to cost of sales turnover ratio (based on the average of inventories at the end of each fiscal year and the previous fiscal year) was 1.79 months compared to 1.94 months at the end of the previous fiscal year. Sony considers this level of inventory to be appropriate in the aggregate. Current assets as of March 31, 2010 in the Financial Services segment increased by 217.2 billion yen, or 26.1 percent, year-on-year to 1048.3 billion yen primarily due to business expansions at Sony Life and Sony Bank. Investments and Advances Investments and advances as of March 31, 2010 increased by 501.0 billion yen, or 10.4 percent year-on-year, to 5,299.4 billion yen. Investments and advances as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 37.3 billion yen, or 11.0 percent, to 376.7 billion yen primarily due to valuation gains from securities and investments to establish a joint venture with Sharp to produce large-sized LCD panels. Investments and advances as of March 31, 2010 in the Financial Services segment increased by 456.5 billion yen, or 10.1 percent, year-on-year to 4,967.1 billion yen. This increase was primarily due to the expansion of businesses of Sony Life and Sony Bank, such as an increase in investments mainly in Japanese fixed income securities by Sony Life, and in mortgage loans at Sony Bank. Also refer to Investments below. Property, Plant and Equipment (after deduction of accumulated depreciation) Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2010 decreased by 167.9 billion yen, or 14.3 percent year-on-year, to 1,008.0 billion yen. Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 171.9 billion yen, or 15.0 percent, year-on-year to 973.2 billion yen. Capital expenditures (additions to property, plant and equipment) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 139.3 billion yen, or 42.0 percent year-on-year, to 192.7 billion yen. Factors other than capital expenditures contributing to the decrease in property, plant and equipment includes the recording of an impairment charge related to LCD television assets and the sale or disposal of assets due to the sale of certain factories. Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2010 in the Financial Services segment increased by 3.9 billion yen, or 12.8 percent, year-on-year to 34.7 billion yen. Other Assets Other assets as of March 31, 2010 increased by 4.1 billion yen, or 0.2 percent, year-on-year to 2,115.8 billion yen primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets, partially offset by a decrease in intangible assets. Liabilities Total current and long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2010 increased by 783.7 billion yen, or 8.9 percent year-on-year, to 9,580.6 billion yen. Total current and long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 199.3 billion yen, or 5.5 percent, to 3,803.1 billion yen. Total current and long-term liabilities in the Financial Services segment as of March 31, 2010 increased by 555.1 billion yen, or 10.4 percent, year-on-year to 5,894.5 billion yen. Current Liabilities Current liabilities as of March 31, 2010 increased by 249.0 billion yen, or 6.5 percent year-on-year, to 4,059.9 billion yen. Current liabilities as of March 31, 2010 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 11.8 billion yen, or 0.5 percent, to 2,326.4 billion yen. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 200.9 billion yen, or 46.6 percent, year-on-year to 230.6 billion yen primarily as a result of the repayment of commercial paper (CP). 57 Table of Contents Notes and accounts payable, trade as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 258.2 billion yen, or 47.3 percent, year-on-year to 804.3 billion yen primarily due to year-on-year increases in the procurement of raw materials compared to the previous fiscal year which was impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown. Current liabilities as of March 31, 2010 in the Financial Services segment increased by 221.2 billion yen, or 14.2 percent, to 1,773.8 billion yen, mainly due to an increase in deposits from customers at Sony Bank. Long-term Liabilities Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2010 increased by 534.6 billion yen, or 10.7 percent year-on-year, to 5,520.6 billion yen. Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 187.5 billion yen, or 14.5 percent, to 1,476.6 billion yen. In addition, long-term debt as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 307.8 billion yen, or 52.6 percent, to 893.4 billion yen. This was primarily due to issuances of long-term corporate bonds and borrowings from banks. Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2010 in the Financial Services segment increased by 333.9 billion yen, or 8.8 percent, to 4,120.7 billion yen. This was primarily due to an increase in policy amount in force at Sony Life. Total Interest-bearing Debt Total interest-bearing debt inclusive of long-term debt and short-term borrowings as of March 31, 2010 increased by 97.5 billion yen, or 8.8 percent year-on-year, to 1,208.8 billion yen. Total interest-bearing debt as of March 31, 2010 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 106.9 billion yen, or 10.5 percent, to 1,124.0 billion yen. Sony Corporations Stockholders Equity Sony Corporations stockholders equity as of March 31, 2010 was virtually flat year-on-year at 2,965.9 billion yen. Retained earnings decreased by 65.9 billion yen, or 3.4 percent, year-on-year to 1,851.0 billion yen as a result of the recording of 40.8 billion yen in net loss attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders and dividend payments of 25.1 billion yen. Accumulated other comprehensive income improved by 64.4 billion yen, or 8.8 percent year-on-year, to a loss of 669.1 billion yen primarily due to the recording of 32.3 billion yen of unrealized gains on securities and 23.7 billion yen of pension liability adjustments. The ratio of Sony Corporations stockholders equity to total assets decreased 1.6 percentage points compared to the end of the previous fiscal year, from 24.7 percent to 23.1 percent. Information of Financial Position Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of financial position for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, and for the Financial Services segment alone. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. 58 Table of Contents Financial Services segment March 31 2009 2010 (Yen in millions) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 95,794 206,742 Marketable securities 463,809 576,129 Notes and accounts receivable, trade 13,380 10,099 Other 258,162 255,366 831,145 1,048,336 Investments and advances 4,510,668 4,967,125 Property, plant and equipment 30,778 34,725 Other assets: Deferred insurance acquisition costs 400,412 418,525 Other 132,654 108,421 533,066 526,946 5,905,657 6,577,132 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings 65,636 86,102 Notes and accounts payable, trade 16,855 13,709 Deposits from customers in the banking business 1,326,360 1,509,488 Other 143,781 164,545 1,552,632 1,773,844 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 97,296 42,536 Accrued pension and severance costs 10,889 12,144 Future insurance policy benefits and other 3,521,060 3,876,292 Other 157,520 189,681 3,786,765 4,120,653 Sony Corporations stockholders equity 565,135 681,500 Noncontrolling interests 1,125 1,135 5,905,657 6,577,132 59 Table of Contents Sony without the Financial Services segment March 31 2009 2010 (Yen in millions) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 564,995 984,866 Marketable securities 3,103 3,364 Notes and accounts receivable, trade 847,214 887,694 Other 1,426,045 1,243,345 2,841,357 3,119,269 Film costs 306,877 310,065 Investments and advances 339,389 376,669 Investments in Financial Services, at cost 116,843 116,843 Property, plant and equipment 1,145,085 973,226 Other assets 1,621,396 1,626,764 6,370,947 6,522,836 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings 431,536 230,631 Notes and accounts payable, trade 546,125 804,336 Other 1,336,947 1,291,481 2,314,608 2,326,448 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 585,636 893,418 Accrued pension and severance costs 354,817 283,382 Other 348,684 299,808 1,289,137 1,476,608 Sony Corporations stockholders equity 2,727,562 2,662,712 Noncontrolling interests 39,640 57,068 6,370,947 6,522,836 60 Table of Contents Consolidated March 31 2009 2010 (Yen in millions) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 660,789 1,191,608 Marketable securities 466,912 579,493 Notes and accounts receivable, trade 853,454 891,625 Other 1,639,480 1,470,146 3,620,635 4,132,872 Film costs 306,877 310,065 Investments and advances 4,798,430 5,299,393 Property, plant and equipment 1,175,863 1,007,951 Other assets: Deferred insurance acquisition costs 400,412 418,525 Other 1,711,294 1,697,308 2,111,706 2,115,833 12,013,511 12,866,114 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings 451,155 284,607 Notes and accounts payable, trade 560,795 817,118 Deposits from customers in the banking business 1,326,360 1,509,488 Other 1,472,590 1,448,712 3,810,900 4,059,925 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 660,147 924,207 Accrued pension and severance costs 365,706 295,526 Future insurance policy benefits and other 3,521,060 3,876,292 Other 439,096 424,609 4,986,009 5,520,634 Sony Corporations stockholders equity 2,964,653 2,965,905 Noncontrolling interests 251,949 319,650 12,013,511 12,866,114 61 Table of Contents Investments The following table contains available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, including the breakdown of unrealized gains and losses by investment category.

Of the unrealized loss amounts recorded by Sony Life, approximately 60.1 percent related to securities being in an unrealized loss position for a period longer than 12 months as of March 31, 2010. These securities primarily consist of Japanese government bonds classified as held-to-maturity securities. Sony Life principally invests in debt securities in various industries. Almost all of these securities were rated BBB or higher by Standard & Poors, Moodys or other rating agencies. As of March 31, 2010, Sony Bank had debt securities which had gross unrealized losses of 9.1 billion yen. Of the unrealized losses recorded by Sony Bank, approximately 94.8 percent related to securities being in an unrealized loss position for a period longer than 12 months as of March 31, 2010. Sony Bank principally invests in Japanese government bonds, Japanese corporate bonds and foreign bonds. Almost all of these securities were rated BBB or higher by Standard & Poors, Moodys or other rating agencies. These unrealized losses related to numerous investments, with no single investment being in a material unrealized loss position for longer than 12 months. In addition, there was no individual security with unrealized losses that met the test for impairment as the declines in value were observed to be small both in amounts and percentage, and therefore, the decline in value for those investments was still determined to be temporary in nature. 62 Table of Contents For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Life as of March 31, 2010 (32.0 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year: 0.1 percent  1 to 5 years:   5 to 10 years: 0.1 percent  above 10 years: 99.8 percent For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Bank as of March 31, 2010 (9.1 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year: 5.5 percent  1 to 5 years: 66.6 percent  5 to 10 years: 0.3 percent  above 10 years: 27.6 percent In the ordinary course of business, Sony maintains long-term investment securities, included in securities investments and other issued by a number of non-public companies. The aggregate carrying amount of the investments in non-public companies as of March 31, 2010 was 70.7 billion yen. A non-public equity investment is primarily valued at cost if fair value is not readily determinable. If the value is estimated to have declined and such decline is judged to be other-than-temporary, the impairment of the investment is recognized immediately and the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, total realized impairment losses were 37.1 billion yen, 45.6 billion yen and 5.5 billion yen, respectively, of which 24.0 billion yen, 41.2 billion yen and 2.6 billion yen, respectively, were recorded in financial service revenue by the subsidiaries in the Financial Services segment. Realized impairment losses recorded other than by subsidiaries in the Financial Services segment in each of the three fiscal years were reflected in non-operating expenses and primarily relate to certain strategic investments in non-financial services businesses. These investments primarily relate to certain strategic investments in Japan and the U.S. with which Sony has strategic relationships for the purposes of developing and marketing new technologies. Impairment losses were recorded for each of the three fiscal years as certain companies failed to successfully develop and market such technology, resulting in the operating performance of these companies being more unfavorable than previously expected. As a result the decline in the fair value of these companies was judged as other-than-temporary. None of these impairment losses was individually material to Sony. Upon determination that the value of an investment is impaired, the value of the investment is written down to its fair value. For an investment where the quoted price is available in an active market, fair value is determined based on unadjusted quoted prices as of the date on which the impairment determination is made. For investments where the quoted price is not available in an active market, fair value is usually determined based on quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or measured through the use of various methodologies such as pricing models, discounted cash flow techniques or similar techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investments. The impairment losses that were recorded in each of the three fiscal years related to the unique facts and circumstances of each individual investment and did not significantly impact other investments. Sony Life and Sony Banks investments constitute the majority of the investments in the Financial Services segment. Sony Life and Sony Bank account for approximately 78 percent and 20 percent of the investments in the Financial Services segment, respectively. 63 Table of Contents Contractual obligations, commitments, and contingent liabilities The following table summarizes Sonys contractual obligations and commitments as of March 31, 2010. The references to the notes below refer to the corresponding notes within the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

These cash payments are based upon assumptions including morbidity, mortality, withdrawals and other factors. Amounts presented in the above table are undiscounted. The sum of the cash payments of 11,303.0 billion yen exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of 3,858.4 billion yen included in the consolidated financial statements principally due to the time value of money (please refer to Note 10 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements). ** The total amounts represent the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions. Sony estimates 167 million yen of the liability is expected to be settled within one year. The settlement period for the remaining portion of the liability, which totaled 229.1 billion yen, cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty associated with the timing of the settlements with the various taxing authorities (please refer to Note 21 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements). 64 Table of Contents The following items are not included in either the above table or the total amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2010:  The total amount of expected future pension payments is not included as such amount is not currently determinable. Sony expects to contribute approximately 33 billion yen to Japanese pension plans and approximately 17 billion yen to foreign pension plans during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 (please refer to Note 15 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements).  The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under loan agreements in the Financial Services segment is not included as it is not foreseeable what loans will be incurred under such line of credit. The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under these contracts was 176.6 billion yen as of March 31, 2010 (please refer to Note 26 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements).  Purchases are made during the ordinary course of business from certain component manufacturers and contract manufacturers in order to establish the best pricing and continuity of supply for Sonys production and are not included in the above table as there are typically no binding purchase obligations. Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Sony. These obligations specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be cancelled without penalty. Sony enters into arrangements with certain component manufacturers whereby Sony procures goods and services, including product components, for these component manufacturers and is reimbursed for the related purchases. Sonys supply chain management allows for flexible and mutually beneficial purchase arrangements with these manufacturers in order to minimize inventory risk. Consistent with industry practice, Sony purchases processed goods that meet technical criteria from these component manufacturers after issuing to these manufacturers information on Sonys projected demand and manufacturing needs. Further, in connection with the sale of its LCD television manufacturing operations in Mexico during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony entered into an agreement with the buyer, a contract manufacturer, to purchase certain LCD televisions in the future. The initial term of the agreement is for one year. In this agreement, Sony agreed to purchase a specified share of the LCD televisions that Sony sells in certain markets, including the U.S. market. However, there is no binding purchase obligation as the specified share and pricing terms only apply to actual sales. In order to fulfill its commitments, Sony will use existing cash, cash generated by its operating activities, and intra-group borrowings, where possible. Further, Sony may raise funds through bonds, CP programs and committed lines of credit from banks, when necessary. The following table summarizes Sonys contingent liabilities as of March 31, 2010. Total Amounts of Contingent Liabilities Contingent Liabilities: (Note 26) (Yen in millions ) Loan guarantees to a creditor of the third party investor 27,912 Guarantees for a portion of Sony Ericssons debt 18,738 Other 35,726 Total contingent liabilities 82,376 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Sony has certain off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources and/or credit risk support. Sony has established several accounts receivable sales programs in Japan whereby Sony can sell up to 50.0 billion yen of eligible trade accounts receivable in the aggregate at any one time. Through these programs, Sony can sell receivables to qualified special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. Sony can sell 65 Table of Contents receivables in which the agreed upon original due dates are no more than 190 days after the sales of receivables. These transactions are accounted for as sales in accordance with the accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. Total trade accounts receivable sold during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 181.4 billion yen, 130.8 billion yen and 109.3 billion yen, respectively. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. In addition to the cash proceeds from the sales transactions above, net cash flows between the qualified special purpose entities and Sony, including servicing fees, in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 related to these transactions were insignificant. Although Sony continues servicing the receivables subsequent to being sold, no servicing liabilities are recorded as the costs of collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. A subsidiary of the Financial Services segment has established several receivables sales programs whereby the subsidiary can sell up to 23.0 billion yen of eligible receivables in the aggregate at any one time. Through these programs, the subsidiary can sell receivables to qualified special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. The subsidiary can sell receivables in which the agreed upon original due dates are no more than 180 days after the sales of receivables. These transactions are accounted for as sales in accordance with the accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities, since the subsidiary has relinquished control of the receivables. Total receivables sold during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 113.8 billion yen, 166.1 billion yen and 183.8 billion yen, respectively. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. In addition to the cash proceeds from the sales transactions above, net cash flows between the qualified special purpose entities and Sony, including servicing fees, in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 related to these transactions were insignificant. Although the subsidiary continues servicing the receivables subsequent to being sold, no servicing liabilities are recorded, as the costs of collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony established an accounts receivable sales program in the United States. Through this program, a newly created special purpose entity, which is consolidated by a U.S. subsidiary, can sell up to 450 million U.S. dollars of eligible trade accounts receivables in the aggregate at any one time to a commercial bank. These transactions are accounted for as a sale in accordance with the accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. Total trade accounts receivables sold during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 were 258.1 billion yen (2,893 million U.S. dollars). Losses from these transactions were insignificant. In addition to the cash proceeds from the sales transactions above, net cash flows between the special purpose entity which is consolidated by Sony and the commercial bank, including servicing fees, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 related to these transactions were insignificant. Although Sony continues servicing the receivables subsequent to being sold or contributed, no servicing liabilities are recorded as the costs of collection of the sold or contributed receivables are insignificant. Sony has, from time to time, entered into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs). These arrangements include facilities which provide for the leasing of certain property, the financing of film production, the U.S. based music publishing business, several joint ventures in the recorded music business and the outsourcing of manufacturing operations. In several of the arrangements in which Sony holds significant variable interests, Sony is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates these VIEs. Arrangements in which Sony holds significant variable interests in VIEs but Sony is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate are described as follows: A subsidiary in the Pictures segment entered into a joint venture agreement with a VIE to acquire the international distribution rights, as defined, to 12 pictures. The subsidiary is required to distribute the product internationally, for contractually defined fees determined as percentages of gross receipts and is responsible for all distribution and marketing expenses, which are recouped from such distribution fees, each as defined. The VIE was capitalized with total financing of 406 million U.S. dollars. Of this amount, 11 million U.S. dollars was contributed by the subsidiary, 95 million U.S. dollars was provided by unrelated third party investors and the remaining funding was provided through a 300 million U.S. dollar bank credit facility. Under the agreement, the subsidiarys 11 million U.S. dollars equity investment is the last equity to be repaid. Based on the factors above, it was previously determined that the subsidiary was the primary beneficiary as it was projected to absorb the majority of the losses or residual returns. As of March 31, 2009, the bank credit facility had been terminated and the third party 66 Table of Contents investors have been repaid their 95 million U.S. dollar investment. On May 11, 2009, the subsidiary repurchased from the VIE the international distribution rights to the 12 pictures and the VIE received a participation interest in these films on identical financial terms to those described above. As a result of repurchasing the international distribution rights from the VIE, Sony determined that the subsidiary is no longer the primary beneficiary as it is not projected to absorb the majority of the losses or residual returns of the VIE. No gain or loss was recognized by the subsidiary on the deconsolidation of the VIE. As of March 31, 2010, the subsidiarys balance sheet includes 316 million yen of film costs related to the international distribution rights acquired from the VIE and 1,647 million yen of participation liabilities due to the VIE. A subsidiary in the Pictures segment entered into two separate production/co-financing agreements with VIEs to co-finance 19 films that were released over the 31 months ended July 31, 2008. The subsidiary received 568 million U.S. dollars over the term of the agreements to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). Additionally, on January 9, 2007, the subsidiary entered into a third production/co-financing agreement with another VIE to co-finance a majority of the films to be submitted through March 2012. The subsidiary has received a commitment from the third VIE that it will fund up to 525 million U.S. dollars on a revolving basis to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). As of March 31, 2010, 14 films of the subsidiary have been released and approximately 392 million U.S. dollars have been funded by the third VIE. Under all three agreements, the subsidiary is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIEs share in the net profits, as defined, of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs, each as defined. As the subsidiary did not make any equity investment in these three VIEs nor issue any guarantees with respect to the VIEs, the subsidiary does not absorb the majority of the losses or residual returns, and therefore does not qualify as the primary beneficiary for any of the VIEs. As of March 31, 2010, there are no amounts recorded on the subsidiarys balance sheet that relate to any of the VIEs other than the investors earned but unpaid share of the films net profits, as defined. In January 2010, Sony sold approximately 90 percent of its interest in a Mexican subsidiary which primarily manufactured LCD televisions, as well as other assets including machinery and equipment of 4,520 million yen and inventory of 5,619 million yen, to a contract manufacturer. The continuing entity, which will perform this manufacturing going forward, was determined to be a VIE as it is thinly capitalized and dependent on funding from the parent entity. Sony was not considered to be the primary beneficiary as it is not expected to absorb the majority of the expected losses of the entity. In connection with the sale of Sonys controlling interest in the subsidiary, Sony received 11,189 million yen and recorded a loss of 1,664 million yen during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Concurrent with the sale, Sony entered into an agreement with the VIE and its parent company in which Sony agreed to purchase a significant share of the LCD televisions that Sony sells in certain markets, including the U.S. market. As of March 31, 2010, the amounts recorded on Sonys balance sheet that relate to the VIE include accounts receivable-non trade of 6,991 million yen and accounts payable, trade of 30,263 million yen. Sonys maximum exposure to losses is considered insignificant. Refer to Note 23 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on variable interest entities. Cash Flows (The fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009) Operating Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, there was a net cash inflow of 912.9 billion yen from operating activities, an increase of 505.8 billion yen, or 124.2 percent year-on-year. For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a net cash inflow of 570.2 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, an increase of 457.5 billion yen, or 406.0 percent year-on-year. The major cash inflow factors included a cash contribution from net income after taking into account depreciation and amortization (including amortization of film costs), an increase in notes and accounts payable, trade, and a decrease in inventories. This exceeded cash outflow, which included increases in film costs and in notes and accounts receivable, trade. Compared with the prior fiscal year, the net cash inflow increased mainly due to an increase in notes and accounts payable, trade in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 compared to a decrease in the prior fiscal 67 Table of Contents year and lower tax payments. This increase was partially offset by an increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 compared to a decrease in the prior fiscal year. The Financial Services segment had a net cash inflow of 348.0 billion yen, an increase of 47.9 billion yen, or 16.0 percent year-on-year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, net cash inflow was generated primarily due to an increase in revenue from insurance premiums as a result of a steady increase in policy amount in force at Sony Life. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash inflow increased primarily reflecting the increase in revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony used 746.0 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 335.3 billion yen, or 31.0 percent year-on-year. For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was 247.9 billion yen of net cash used, a decrease of 239.5 billion yen, or 49.1 percent year-on-year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, net cash was used mainly for purchases of manufacturing equipment. The net cash used decreased year-on-year primarily as a result of lower investments in and purchases of manufacturing equipment, although the previous fiscal year benefited from proceeds generated mainly from the sale of semiconductor fabrication equipment. The Financial Services segment used 475.7 billion yen of net cash, a decrease of 126.6 billion yen, or 21.0 percent year-on-year. Payments for investments and advances, carried out primarily at Sony Life and Sony Bank, where operations are expanding, exceeded proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances. The net cash used within the Financial Services segment decreased year-on-year primarily due to a decrease in investments at Sony Bank. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, net cash generated by operating and investing activities combined* for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was 322.3 billion yen, an improvement of 697.1 billion yen compared to net cash used in the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, 365.0 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities, an increase of 97.6 billion yen, or 36.5 percent year-on-year. For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a 98.6 billion yen net cash inflow, an increase of 88.7 billion yen, or 891.7 percent year-on year. This was primarily due to issuances of long-term corporate bonds and borrowings from banks in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, which were partially offset by net repayments of short-term borrowings including commercial paper. In June 2009, Sony Corporation issued domestic straight bonds totaling 220 billion yen in Japan with maturities ranging from 3 to 10 years. In the Financial Services segment, financing activities generated 238.6 billion yen of net cash, a decrease of 21.7 billion yen, or 8.3 percent year-on-year, primarily due to a decrease in short-term borrowings, net for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 compared to an increase for the prior fiscal year. Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: Accounting for the above factors and the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2010 was 1,191.6 billion yen, an increase of 530.8 billion yen, or 80.3 percent compared with the balance as of March 31, 2009. The outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments excluding the Financial Services segment was 984.9 billion yen, an increase of 419.9 billion yen, or 74.3 percent, compared with the balance as of March 31, 2009. Sony believes it continues to maintain sufficient liquidity through access to a total, translated into yen, of 788.5 billion yen of unused committed lines of credit with financial institutions in addition to the cash and cash equivalents balance at March 31, 2010. Within the Financial Services segment, the outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents was 206.7 billion yen, an increase of 110.9 billion yen, or 115.8 percent, compared with the balance as of March 31, 2009. * Sony has included the information for cash flow from operating and investing activities combined excluding the Financial Services segments activities, as management frequently monitors this financial measure, and believes this non-GAAP measurement is important for use in evaluating Sonys ability to generate cash to maintain liquidity and fund debt principal and dividend payments from business activities other than its Financial Services segment. This information is derived from the reconciliations prepared in the section Information of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment. This information and the separate condensed presentations shown below are not required or prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Financial Services segments cash flow is excluded 68 Table of Contents from the measure because SFH, which constitutes a majority of the Financial Services segment, is a separate publicly traded entity in Japan with a significant minority interest and it, as well as its subsidiaries, secure liquidity on their own. This measure may not be comparable to those of other companies. This measure has limitations, because it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures principally due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the principal payments required for debt service. Therefore, Sony believes it is important to view this measure as supplemental to its entire statement of cash flows and together with Sonys disclosures regarding investments, available credit facilities and overall liquidity. A reconciliation of the differences between the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reported and cash flows from operating and investing activities combined excluding the Financial Services segments activities is as follows: Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2009 2010 (Billions of yen) Net cash provided by operating activities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows 407.2 912.9 Net cash used in investing activities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows (1,081.3 ) (746.0 ) (674.1 ) 166.9 Less: Net cash provided by operating activities within the Financial Services segment 300.1 348.0 Less: Net cash used in investing activities within the Financial Services segment (602.4 ) (475.7 ) Eliminations ** (3.0 ) 27.7 Cash flow from operating and investing activities combined excluding the Financial Services segments activities (374.8 ) 322.3 ** Eliminations primarily consist of intersegment loans and dividend payments. Intersegment loans are between Sony Corporation and Sony Financial International Inc. (SFI), an entity included within the Financial Services segment. Information of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited cash flow information for all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, and for the Financial Services segment alone. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was net cash inflow of 112.7 billion yen in operating activities, a decrease of 406.4 billion yen, or 78.3 percent year-on-year. The major cash inflow factors include a cash contribution from net income (loss), after taking into account depreciation and amortization, and decreases in notes and accounts receivable, trade primarily due to a decrease in sales during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. These factors exceeded cash outflows, which included decreases in notes and accounts payable, trade. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities decreased mainly as a result of a decrease in net income (loss), after taking into account depreciation and amortization. The Financial Services segment had a net cash inflow of 300.1 billion yen from operating activities, an increase of 57.5 billion yen, or 23.7 percent year-on-year. The Financial Services segment generated net cash mainly from an increase in revenue from insurance premiums, reflecting a steady increase in policy amount in force, primarily at Sony Life. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided increased mainly due to an increase in revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony used 1,081.3 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 170.9 billion yen, or 18.8 percent year-on-year. For all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, 487.4 billion yen of net cash was used in investing activities, an increase of 472.5 billion yen, or 3,166.0 percent year-on-year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, payments for items such as purchases of manufacturing equipment and the acquisition of Bertelsmanns 50 percent interest in SONY BMG exceeded proceeds generated mainly from the sales of semiconductor fabrication equipment. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities increased. The previous 70 Table of Contents fiscal years net cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of shares in SFH, the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, and the sale of a portion of the site which was Sonys former headquarters. The Financial Services segment used 602.4 billion yen in net cash, a decrease of 271.3 billion yen, or 31.1 percent year-on-year. Within the Financial Services segment, payments primarily for investments carried out at Sony Life, as well as for investments and advances carried out at Sony Bank, where operations are expanding, exceeded proceeds mainly from the maturities and sales of marketable securities and collections of advances. Net cash used in investing activities within the Financial Services segment decreased mainly because an increase in investment asset sales exceeded an increase in investments at Sony Life. In all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, net cash provided by operating activities and used in investing activities combined* was a net outflow of 374.8 yen billion, a deterioration of 878.9 billion yen year-on-year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, 267.5 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities, a decrease of 238.1 billion yen, or 47.1 percent year-on-year. For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a net cash inflow of 9.9 billion yen in financing activities, an increase of 22.0 billion yen compared to a net cash outflow of 12.1 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to issuances of CP and corporate bonds and borrowings from banks in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, partially offset by the redemption of convertible bonds. In the Financial Services segment, since the increase primarily in policyholder accounts at Sony Life and in deposits from customers at Sony Bank were less than the increases in the previous fiscal year, financing activities generated 260.3 billion yen of net cash, a decrease of 231.4 billion yen, or 47.1 percent year-on-year. Accounting for the above factors and the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2009 was 660.8 billion yen, a decrease of 425.6 billion yen, or 39.2 percent compared with the balance as of March 31, 2008. The outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments excluding the Financial Services segment was 565.0 billion yen, a decrease of 383.7 billion yen, or 40.4 percent compared with the balance as of March 31, 2008. Within the Financial Services segment, the outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents was 95.8 billion yen, a decrease of 41.9 billion yen, or 30.4 percent compared with the balance as of March 31, 2008. * A reconciliation of the differences between the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reported and cash flows from operating and investing activities combined excluding the Financial Services segments activities is as follows: Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2008 2009 (Billions of yen) Net cash provided by operating activities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows 757.7 407.2 Net cash used in investing activities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows (910.4 ) (1,081.3 ) (152.7 ) (674.1 ) Less: Net cash provided by operating activities within the Financial Services segment 242.6 300.1 Less: Net cash used in investing activities within the Financial Services segment (873.6 ) (602.4 ) Eliminations ** 25.9 (3.0 ) Cash flow from operating and investing activities combined excluding the Financial Services segments activities 504.2 (374.8 ) ** Eliminations primarily consist of intersegment loans and dividend payments.

Furthermore, the Financial Services segment is described separately at the end of this section. Liquidity Management and Market Access An important financial objective of Sony is to maintain the strength of its balance sheet, while securing adequate liquidity for business activities. Sony defines its liquidity sources as the amount of cash and cash equivalents (cash balance) (excluding restrictions on capital transfers mainly due to country regulations) and the unused amount of committed lines of credit. Sonys basic liquidity management policy is to secure sufficient liquidity throughout the relevant fiscal year, covering such factors as 50 percent of monthly consolidated sales and repayments on debt that comes due within six months. Funding requirements that arise from maintaining liquidity are principally covered by cash flow from operating and investing activities combined and by the cash balance; however, as needed, Sony has demonstrated the ability to procure funds from financial and capital markets. In the event financial and capital markets became illiquid, based on its current forecasts, Sony could sustain sufficient liquidity through access to committed lines of credit with financial institutions, together with its cash balance. Sony procures funds mainly from the financial and capital markets through Sony Corporation and SGTS, a finance subsidiary in the U.K. In June 2009, Sony Corporation issued domestic straight bonds totaling 220 billion yen (3 years, 5 years and 10 years maturity) for redemption of domestic bonds and CP and executed loans totaling 162.5 billion yen from a syndicate of banks (3 years, 5 years and 7 years maturity), of which the proceeds were used for the redemption of syndicated loans and for general business activities, including working capital. In addition, Sony Corporation executed a 1.0 billion U.S. dollar long-term bank loan in July 2009 (3 years maturity). The proceeds were used as general corporate funds for overseas operations, in regions including the U.S. and Europe. In order to meet working capital requirements, Sony Corporation and SGTS maintain CP programs which have the ability to access the Japanese, the U.S. and European CP markets, subject to prevailing market conditions. As of March 31, 2010, the CP program limit amounts translated into yen was 1,151.3 billion yen in total for Sony Corporation and SGTS. There was no outstanding balance of CP as of March 31, 2010, although the largest month-end outstanding balance of CP during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was 189.9 billion yen in May 2009. While Sony mainly issued CP in the Japanese CP market for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, due to the recent recovery of the U.S. and European CP markets, Sony currently believes funding from these markets is also available. Sony typically raises funds through the aforementioned straight bonds, CP programs and bank loans (including syndicated loans); however, in the unlikely event Sony could not access liquidity from these sources, Sony can also draw on committed lines of credit from various financial institutions. Sony has a total, translated into yen, of 788.5 billion yen in committed lines of credit, none of which had been used as of March 31, 2010. Details of those committed lines of credit are: a 475 billion yen committed line of credit contracted with a syndicate of Japanese banks, effective until November 2012, 1.5 billion U.S. dollars multi-currency committed line of credit also with a syndicate of Japanese banks, effective until December 2013, and 1.87 billion U.S. dollars of another multi-currency committed line of credit contracted with a syndicate of global banks, effective until April 2012, in all of which Sony Corporation and SGTS are defined as the borrowers. These contracts are aimed at securing sufficient liquidity in a quick and stable manner even in the event of financial and capital markets turmoil seen since September 2008. In the event of a downgrade in Sonys credit ratings, even though the cost of some of those borrowings could increase, there are no financial covenants in any of Sonys material financial agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation or any impairment on the ability to drawdown on unused facilities. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the uses of most proceeds except that certain borrowings may not be used to acquire securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange or traded over-the-counter in the U.S. in accordance with the rules and regulations issued by authorities such as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. 73 Table of Contents Ratings Sony considers one of managements top priorities to be the maintenance of stable and appropriate credit ratings in order to ensure financial flexibility for liquidity and capital management and continued adequate access to sufficient funding resources in the financial and capital markets. In order to facilitate access to global capital markets, Sony obtains credit ratings from two rating agencies, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Standard and Poors Rating Services (S&P). In addition, Sony maintains a rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), a rating agency in Japan, for access to the Japanese capital markets. Sonys current debt ratings from each agency as of June 28, 2010 are noted below: Moodys S&P R&I Long-term debt A3 (Outlook: negative) A- (Outlook: negative) AA- (Outlook: negative) Short-term debt P-2 A-2 a-1+ Cash Management Sony manages its global cash management activities mainly through SGTS. The excess or shortage of cash at most of Sonys subsidiaries is invested or funded by SGTS on a net basis, although Sony recognizes that fund transfers are limited in certain countries and geographic areas due to restrictions on capital transactions. In order to pursue more efficient cash management, cash surpluses among Sonys subsidiaries are deposited with SGTS and cash shortfalls among subsidiaries are covered by loans through SGTS, so that Sony can make use of excess cash balances and reduce third-party borrowings. Financial Services segment The management of SFH, Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank recognizes the importance of securing sufficient liquidity to cover the payment of obligations that these companies incur in the ordinary course of business. Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank maintain a sufficient cash balance and secure sufficient means to meet their obligations while abiding by laws and regulations such as the Insurance Business Act or the Banking Act of Japan, and restrictions imposed by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) and other regulatory authorities as well as establishing and operating under company guidelines that comply with these regulations. Sony Life and Sony Assurance establish a sufficient level of liquidity for the smooth payment of insurance claims when they invest primarily in various securities cash inflows which are mainly from policyholders insurance premiums. Sony Bank establish a necessary level of liquidity for the smooth settlement of transactions when it uses its cash inflows, which come mainly from customers deposits in local or foreign currencies, in order to offer mortgage loans to individuals or to make bond investments. SFH currently has an AA- rating from R&I for issuer rating. Sony Life currently has ratings from four rating agencies: A+ from S&P for insurer financial strength rating, Aa3 from Moodys for insurance financial strength rating, AA from R&I for ability to pay insurance claims and AA from the Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd. (JCR) for ability to pay insurance claims. Sony Bank obtained an A-rating from S&P for its long-term counterparty credit rating, an A-2 rating from S&P for its short-term counterparty credit rating and an AA- rating from the JCR for long-term senior debt rating. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT It is necessary for Sony to continue technological innovation in order to maintain group-wide growth. Sony believes that technology made possible by our research and development activities is key to the differentiation of products in existing businesses and the source of creating value in new businesses. Research and development is focused in four key domains: a common development platform technology for home and mobile electronics, and semiconductor, device, and software technologies, which are essential for product differentiation and for creating value-added products. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 decreased by 65.3 billion yen, or 13.1 percent year-on-year, to 432.0 billion yen. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which 74 Table of Contents excludes Financial Services segment revenue) decreased from 6.9 percent to 6.8 percent. Expenses in the CPD segment decreased 56.3 billion yen, or 17.8 percent year-on-year, to 259.4 billion yen and expenses in the NPS segment decreased 3.9 billion yen, or 4.2 percent year-on-year, to 89.2 billion yen. In the CPD segment, approximately 73 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 27 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as next generation displays, semiconductors, new materials and software. Consolidated research and development costs for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 are expected to increase by 4.2 percent to 450 billion yen. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 23.3 billion yen, or 4.5 percent year-on-year, to 497.3 billion yen. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which excludes Financial Services segment revenue) increased from 6.3 percent to 6.9 percent. Expenses in the CPD segment were 315.8 billion yen and expenses in the NPS segment were 93.1 billion yen. In the CPD segment, approximately 76 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 24 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as next generation displays, semiconductors, new materials and software. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 23.4 billion yen, or 4.3 percent year-on-year, to 520.6 billion yen. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which excludes Financial Services segment revenue) decreased from 7.1 percent to 6.3 percent. TREND INFORMATION This section contains forward-looking statements about the possible future performance of Sony and should be read in light of the cautionary statement on that subject, which appears on the inside front cover page and applies to this entire document. Issues Facing Sony and Managements Response to those Issues The global economy experienced a sharp downturn beginning in the autumn of 2008, following the most severe financial crisis in recent years. Central governments and central banks of major global economies launched large-scale economic stimulus measures and the global economy started to show signs of recovery in late 2009, led mainly by continuously strong growth in domestic demand in emerging markets. Sony has been implementing a number of measures, particularly in the CPD segment, to transform its operational structure. In line with this recovery trend, Sony recorded operating income of 31.8 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, compared to operating loss of 227.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. In emerging markets, increasing demand for entry-level priced products and services is expected to cause intensified competition with new entrants. Developed countries economies are anticipated to recover slowly, with high uncertainty and weak improvement in unemployment rates and consumer spending, significant levels of government debt, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and remaining instability in the financial markets. In such an operating environment, Sony plans to continue enhancing profitable business structures through transformation initiatives and cost reductions in the future. At the same time, Sony plans to aggressively launch 3D-related products and network services and plans to develop other new businesses to realize future growth and create future revenue sources. Transformation initiatives and cost reductions Since April 1, 2009, Sony has been implementing major reorganizations. Sony established three horizontal platforms for (1) manufacturing, logistics, procurement and customer services, (2) R&D and common software development, and (3) global sales and marketing functions, and has been undertaking transformation and business process optimization efforts to enhance profitability. Sony plans to continue the initiatives described below, mainly in the CPD segment. Sony expects restructuring charges to total approximately 80 billion yen in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 compared with the 124.3 billion yen, including 7.9 billion yen of non-cash charges related to depreciation associated with restructured assets, recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 (please refer to Restructuring in Item 5 Operating Results). 75 Table of Contents  Realignment of manufacturing sites: By rationalizing its manufacturing operations, shifting and aggregating manufacturing to lower-cost countries and utilizing the services of OEMs and ODMs, Sony has undertaken fixed cost and total asset reductions. Sonys total manufacturing sites have been reduced from 57 sites in December 2008 to 46 sites as of March 31, 2010. Sony will continue reviewing the efficiency of its manufacturing structure in relation to its operating environments. The realignment of manufacturing sites to be undertaken during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 includes the closure of Sony Precision Engineering Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., the transfer to KYOCERA Corporation of design and manufacturing operations of small-and mid-sized TFT LCD displays at the Yasu site of Sony Mobile Display Corporation, the termination of production at Sony Electronics Inc.s Dothan, Alabama site, the transfer to the Hon Hai Group of approximately 90 percent of Sonys equity interest in the Nitra plant in Slovakia (which currently manufactures LCD televisions for the European region), and the termination of production at Sony Hungária Kft., Gödöllö TEC.  Reductions in procurement cost for components and software: Sony has started developing a common procurement platform and consolidating its suppliers during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Sony expects the substantial benefit of procurement cost reduction through these measures. Since April, 2010, Sony has been integrating software procurement functions that had been diversified within each business unit to the headquarter procurement division, reviewing its various business processes and starting the consolidation of its software vendors. Below is a description of the issues management believes each business continues to face and an explanation as to how each business is addressing those issues, including the above measures it has taken to reduce costs. Consumer Products & Devices Sonys television business will strive to expand its unit sales significantly by enhancing product competitiveness with the launch of 3D televisions and Internet televisions as well as with an increased product range of LED backlit televisions, and by proactively launching strategic models targeting emerging markets where significant volume growth is anticipated. The television business is creating global standards for the basic design of hardware and for software as well as integrating its design and development resources around the world. The business will continue to improve its supply chains and increase the active use of OEMs and ODMs, to build stable and profitable business structures even in the changing operating environment such as global market expansion of entry-level priced models and the price declines accompanying intensified competition. In connection with its strategy for procuring panels, which is important for improving profitability in the television business, Sony will conduct flexible sourcing of LCD panels at competitive prices from panel suppliers including Sonys two joint ventures, S-LCD and Sharp Display Products Corporation (SDP). While Sony will place significant emphasis on sourcing from its joint ventures, it will also continue utilizing open market sources depending on the panel market conditions and television model features. Sony obtains its supply of TFT LCD panels from the 7th and 8th generation production lines at S-LCD, a joint venture located in Korea with Samsung. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony established SDP, a joint venture entity with Sharp, to produce and sell large-sized LCD panels and modules, utilizing the new LCD panel production plant using the 10th generation glass substrate. Sony obtains its supply of LCD panels and modules from SDP. Based on the joint venture agreement with Sharp, Sony invested 10 billion yen in this joint venture in December, 2009 and plans to make a number of additional capital injections, resulting in a maximum 34 percent ownership by Sony by the end of April, 2011. Sonys digital imaging business expects price declines in the mature market due to intensified competition. The business will strive to differentiate the performance of its products with key devices such as image sensors and graphic engines, improve product attractiveness through enhanced network connectivity and continuously strengthen cost competitiveness. In addition, it will aim for further expansion of its market share, with an enhanced line-up of digital SLR models and of entry-level priced models for emerging markets. 76 Table of Contents Networked Products & Services Sonys game business intends to expand all game platforms through an enhanced line-up of software. It also intends to introduce PlayStation®Move motion controller and 3D games for PS3. Sony will strive to expand the business by providing content through both packaged software and utilizing PlayStation®Network. Sony will also strive to improve profitability of the entire game business by improving the profitability of PS3 through hardware cost reduction measures, including reducing the size of key semiconductors and the number of components. Sonys network-related business plans to utilize the PlayStation®Network platform and expand non-game content and services such as video, music and e-books. Sony plans to actively collaborate with third-party content providers and utilize in-house content providers as well to expand its interactive entertainment offerings and sales. The network-related business will also seek to expand this platform to include non-game consumer electronics products and increase the sales of such network-related business. B2B & Disc Manufacturing The broadcasting- and professional-use equipment business will strive to reduce costs in the severe business environment mainly in developed countries, and will seek to expand its business in emerging markets. In order to improve its profitability, it will also enhance the solutions business for broadcast- and professional-use equipment systems and expand 3D-related businesses such as digital cinema projectors and content creation equipment. Pictures In the Pictures segment, Sony faces intense competition, rising expenses, including production, advertising and promotion expenses, a mature home entertainment market with a continuing industry-wide decline in physical DVD sales worldwide, increasingly limited access to third party financing, and a growing trend toward digital piracy. To meet these challenges, Sony is working to produce and acquire a diversified portfolio of motion picture and television product with broad worldwide appeal for distribution in all media and other emerging platforms, including digital distribution. Sony will also explore alternative avenues for financing and take action to combat the unauthorized digital distribution of its copyrighted content. Music The Music segment has been operating in a challenging market environment for several years now, with the ongoing decline in physical sales not yet offset by the continued rapid growth in the digital market. This trend is expected to continue in the medium term. The growing digital business holds significant potential with the launch of new initiatives and introduction of innovative products in the digital marketplace. Against this market backdrop, Sony continues to invest in and develop new and existing artist talent, and is pursuing growing new business revenue streams such as live concerts, artist management, and sponsorships. Financial Services In the Financial Services segment, Sony must rapidly and adequately realize its growth strategy in a fiercely competitive environment and address the needs of a low birthrate and the aging population in Japan as well as the diversifying needs of its customers. In such a business environment, Sonys Financial Services businesses, which are latecomers to the life insurance, non-life insurance and banking industries, will make use of distinctive, individual industry-specific business models and pursue higher levels of customer satisfaction. The Financial Services businesses also plan to achieve further growth by enhancing synergies among the businesses, reinforcing their own positions in the business domains recently entered into, such as individual variable annuity and securities brokerage, and entering into new business domains. Sony Life has been building an investment portfolio mainly comprised of ultralong-term bonds, in order to manage investment risks and ensure stable long-term returns. Based on this policy, Sony Life plans to continue its investment in ultralong-term bonds in the future. In addition, to mitigate the increasing risk of a decline in stock prices, Sony Life has reduced the balance of riskier assets such as stocks and convertible bonds. 77 Table of Contents Sony Ericsson In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011, Sony Ericssons focus will continue to be on returning to profitability on an annual basis through the continued transformation of its portfolio to target mid- to high-end open-OS based models, differentiation by great user experience applications, and renewed quality assurance measures. Sony Ericsson also expects to realize the full benefit of its reduction of operating expenses by the end of 2010, as it completes the cost saving program that started in mid-2008. In addition, Sony Ericsson will continue to employ stricter financial management to improve cash flow from operating activities. Global Environmental Plan Road to Zero Sony announced its Road to Zero global environmental plan in April 2010. The plan includes a long-term vision of achieving a zero environmental footprint by 2050 through Sonys business operations and product lifecycles, in pursuit of a sustainable society. Sony aims to achieve this vision through continuous innovation and the utilization of offset mechanisms. The plan also draws a comprehensive roadmap based on the following four goals:  Climate change: Reduction of energy consumption in pursuit of zero greenhouse gas emissions.  Resource conservation: Reduction in the use of virgin materials of priority resources, by minimizing waste generation, appropriate water consumption, and continuous increase of waste recycling.  Control of chemical substances: Minimization of the risks that certain chemical substances pose to the environment through preventative measures, reduction in the use of specific chemicals defined by Sony, and promotion of the use of alternative materials.  Biodiversity: Conservation and recovery of biodiversity through Sonys own business operations and local social contribution programs. Among the above goals, Sonys specific mid-term targets for climate change include the following:  Target an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (calculated in terms of CO2) of 30 percent by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, compared to the level of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001.  Target a reduction in power consumption per product of 30 percent by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, compared to the level of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Further details of the global environmental plan Road to Zero and actual measures undertaken by Sony are reported in Sonys CSR report available at the following website: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr/environment/index.html CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Sony evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience, future projections and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Sony considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to its financial condition and results, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Sony believes that the following represents its critical accounting policies. Investments Sonys investments include debt and equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity method of accounting. If it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to income. Sony regularly evaluates its investment portfolio to identify other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities. Factors that are considered by Sony 78 Table of Contents in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of the credit condition of the issuers, sovereign risk, and whether or not Sony is able to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities whose fair values are readily determinable, Sony presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally for a period of up to six months). This criterion is employed as a threshold to identify securities which may have a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of other factors which overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is not more than 20 percent or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors which may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. Sony adopted the accounting guidance for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities on April 1, 2009. When an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security has occurred, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income depends on whether Sony intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. If the debt security meets either of these two criteria, the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income is the credit loss, measured as the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost and its fair value at the impairment measurement date. For other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities that do not meet these two criteria, the net amount recognized in income is equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the debt security and its net present value calculated by discounting Sonys best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment. Any difference between the fair value and the net present value of the debt security at the impairment measurement date is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Unrealized gains or losses on securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized in income are presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Before the adoption of this guidance, an other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income for debt securities was equal to the total difference between amortized cost and fair value at the impairment measurement date. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary is often subjective in nature and involves certain assumptions and estimates concerning the expected operating results, business plans and future cash flows of the issuer of the security. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that Sony currently believes to be temporary may be determined to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of subsequent information such as continued poor operating results, future broad declines in the value of worldwide equity markets and the effect of worldwide interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized and reduce income in future periods. Valuation of inventory Sony values its inventory based on the lower of cost or market. Sony writes down inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the net realizable value  i.e., estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal. Sony writes down the value of its inventory when the underlying parts, components or products have become obsolete, when inventory levels exceed the amount expected to be used, or when the value of the inventory is otherwise recorded at a higher value than net realizable value. As a result, if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected and further price decreases are needed, additional inventory write-downs may be required in the future. 79 Table of Contents Impairment of long-lived assets Sony reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets held and used and long-lived assets to be disposed of whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. This review is primarily performed using estimates of future cash flows by product category (e.g. LCD televisions) or, in certain cases, by entity. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates applied to determine terminal values, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in Sonys businesses or assumptions could negatively affect the valuations of long-lived assets. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 19,413 million yen, which included 6,457 million for impairment of long-lived assets of LCD rear-projection television manufacturing facilities to be held and used worldwide in connection with certain restructuring activities in the CPD segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. The deterioration of the business climate and its continued financial impact on the CPD, NPS and B2B & Disc segments in the second half of calendar year 2008 and into early calendar year 2009 was considered a circumstance which indicated that the carrying amounts of the assets or asset groups in those segments may not have been recoverable. As such, Sony tested the long-lived assets of the CPD, NPS and B2B & Disc segments, which consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment, by comparing carrying values of assets or asset groups with estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Impairment charges as a result of the testing are included in the amounts described below. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 17,370 million yen which did not include any individually significant charges. These charges also partially related to restructuring activities, primarily in the CPD segment. The estimates of undiscounted future cash flows for the recoverability testing and discounted cash flows for determining fair value reflected Sonys revised business plans and the deteriorated business climate, particularly the timing and rate of the future business recovery, and required significant judgment. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 53,304 million yen. These charges also partially related to restructuring activities undertaken, primarily in the CPD segment. Of the total impairment charges for long lived assets recorded by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, 27,100 million yen related to the LCD televisions assets group within the CPD segment. The impairment charge primarily reflects a decrease in the estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, management updated its strategic plans, which resulted in decreases in the assets estimated service periods and corresponding estimated future cash flows leading to the impairment charge. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and certain other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and the assets are also tested between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying amount. Such an event would include unfavorable variances from 80 Table of Contents established business plans, significant changes in forecasted results or volatility inherent to external markets and industries, which are periodically reviewed by Sonys management. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Reporting units are Sonys operating segments or one level below the operating segments. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could significantly impact whether or not an impairment charge is recognized as well as the magnitude of any such charge. In its impairment review, Sony performs internal valuation analyses or utilizes third-party valuations when management believes it to be appropriate, and considers other market information that is publicly available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates applied to determine terminal values, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. In addition to the estimates of future cash flows, two of the most significant assumptions applied to estimated cash flows involved in the determination of fair value of the reporting units were the discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to determine terminal values used in the discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rates used in the cash flow models for the goodwill impairment testing considered market and industry data as well as specific risk factors for each reporting unit. The perpetual growth rates for the individual reporting units, for purposes of the terminal value determination, were generally set after an initial three-year forecasted period, although certain reporting units, including the Pictures reporting unit described below, utilized longer forecasted periods, and were based on historical experience, market and industry data. Except as described below, fair value exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units with goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life, and therefore no impairment existed and the second step of the impairment test was not required. As a result, no material impairments of goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life were recorded beyond the impairments described below. When testing goodwill for impairment, consideration was given to Sonys market capitalization in relation to the sum of the calculated fair values of the reporting units, including reporting units with no goodwill, and taking into account corporate level assets and liabilities not assigned to individual reporting units as well as a reasonable control premium. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony recorded an impairment loss of 7,655 million yen for a reporting unit in All Other, which was related to goodwill recorded for Sonys acquisition of Gracenote, Inc. (Gracenote), a company that provides technology and services for digital media identification, enrichment and recommendation. The impairment charge for Gracenote reflected the impact of weakened economic conditions, which resulted in lower growth forecasts for several key markets serviced by Gracenote, including the automotive and mobile communications markets. The valuation of Gracenote also decreased due to the use of a higher discount 81 Table of Contents rate in calculating the present value of future cash flows to reflect higher perceived economic risk due to the economic downturn. The carrying amounts of goodwill by segment as of March 31, 2010 are as follows: Yen in millions Consumer Products & Devices 64,806 Networked Products & Services 123,881 B2B & Disc Manufacturing 16,071 Pictures 102,481 Music 109,886 Financial Services 2,314 All Other 19,430 Total 438,869 Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable; however, in the future, changes in estimates resulting in lower than currently anticipated cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations, which may result in Sony recognizing impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in the future. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the impairment analysis performed for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, Sony applied a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Other than as it relates to the Pictures reporting unit discussed below, a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the estimated fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in a failure of step one of the goodwill impairment test. In addition, the significant assumptions utilized by management and related uncertainties with respect to the Game reporting unit, which has experienced recent operating losses, are also described below. Pictures Reporting Unit For the Production and Distribution reporting unit within the Pictures segment, as of March 31, 2010, a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have resulted in that reporting unit failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. As of March 31, 2010, this reporting unit had 88,592 million yen of goodwill and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by approximately 8 percent. Sony determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis included the projected cash flows from the most recent three year business plan plus an additional seven years of projected cash flows based off of the three year plan. A terminal value was included in this discounted cash flow analysis. The terminal value was based on an exit price in year ten using an earnings multiple and control premium applied to the projected year ten cash flows. The significant estimates and assumptions used included the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, growth rates, timing and amount of future cash flows and the earnings multiple. A discount rate of 9.5 percent was applied to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and was derived from the weighted average cost of capital of market participants in similar businesses. Changes in the financial markets, such as an increase in interest rates or an increase in the expected required return on equity for the entertainment industry, could increase the discount rate in the future, thus decreasing the fair value of the reporting unit. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in the discount rate, holding all other assumptions constant, would not have decreased the fair value of the reporting unit below that of its carrying value, thereby resulting in the reporting unit not failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The earnings multiple and control premium used to calculate the terminal value was obtained through research analyst estimates and values observed in private market transactions. A decrease in the expected cash flow growth rate or profitability in this industry could decrease the earnings multiple and thus decrease the fair value of the reporting unit. A number of key assumptions were used in developing the most recent business plan, the future cash flows and the growth rate of the reporting unit including: (1) the current and expected economic climate and its projected 82 Table of Contents impact on discretionary consumer spending and the advertising market, (2) the historical decline in DVD sales partially offset by an increase in DVD rental revenue, (3) the continued adoption of Blu-ray Disctm and digital formats, (4) the continued development and production of event or tent-pole and animated motion picture properties and (5) changes in the cost structure of the reporting unit related to overhead, marketing and motion picture and television production costs. Growth rates assumed beyond the current business plan took into consideration managements outlook for the future and were compared to historical performance to assess reasonableness. The assumed growth rate beyond the current three year business plan was approximately 5 percent. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in the growth rate, holding all other assumptions constant, would not have decreased the fair value of the reporting unit below that of its carrying value, thereby resulting in the reporting unit not failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The following uncertainties are associated with the key assumptions described above and could have a negative effect on the most recent business plan, the future cash flows and the growth rate of the reporting unit:  The cost of productions and marketing, labor costs, consumer acceptance, timing of releases or syndication sales and the availability of competing products and entertainment alternatives could vary from the amounts assumed in Sonys projections.  Incremental deterioration of major retailers, acceleration of the maturation of the DVD format and increasing competition for retailer shelf space could result in a more rapid decline in DVD sales worldwide beyond Sonys expectations.  The reporting unit is subject to digital piracy and illegal downloading, which have become increasingly prevalent with the development of new technologies and the availability of broadband internet connections. The availability of unauthorized content contributes to a decrease in legitimate product sales and puts pressure on the price of legitimate product sales. This could negatively impact the sales and profitability assumptions included in the projections.  Foreign exchange rate fluctuations beyond the rates included in the cash flow estimates could affect financial results of the reporting unit because a large portion of the reporting units sales and assets are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is the reporting currency of the reporting unit.  A significant portion of the reporting units revenues are from the licensing of its image-based software, including its motion picture and television content, to U.S. and international television networks, which derive a majority of their revenues from the sale of advertising. The reporting unit, to a lesser extent, also directly sells advertising for its image-based software. If the advertising market is negatively impacted compared to the assumptions in the business plan, this could adversely impact the cash flows of the reporting unit. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis summarized above, actual results may differ which could significantly alter the fair value of the reporting unit and possibly cause the reporting unit to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test. Game Reporting Unit Fair value for the Game reporting unit, which had 123,881 million yen of goodwill as of March 31, 2010, was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis including projected cash flows from the most recent three year business plan as well as a terminal value. The estimated fair value for the Game reporting unit at its annual impairment testing date substantially exceeded its carrying value. Sony developed estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. These assumptions considered the recent historical operating losses of the Game reporting unit and managements plans to return to profitability. The significant estimates and assumptions included the timing and amount of future cash flows, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the perpetual growth rate used to calculate the terminal value. These assumptions included (1) the projected growth rate of the game console installed base and the related assumptions regarding (2) projected software revenue, (3) projected peripherals revenue, (4) the continued expansion of the online network business and (5) the pricing of game consoles, particularly the PS3, relative to production cost. 83 Table of Contents The following uncertainties are associated with the key assumptions described above and could have a negative effect on the most recent business plan, the future cash flows and the perpetual growth rate of the reporting unit:  The levels of future game console sales, particularly the PS3, are uncertain and subject to competitive market forces, technological advances and timing of the introduction of new features and platforms by Sony and its competitors. PS3 hardware unit sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 are estimated to reach 15 million units, which is an increase of approximately 2 million units over the previous fiscal year. Future game console sales levels may vary from Sonys projections depending on future pricing, competitors actions and the introduction of new technologies by Sony and others into the marketplace.  The continued stable cash flows from software sales driven by the growth of the game console installed base, which is projected to offset declines in software revenue from older gaming platforms, could be negatively impacted by declines in future royalties received from third-party software developers, lower game console sales or an inability to provide an attractive line-up of software to customers.  The growth of cash flows from peripherals as new products are introduced, such as motion controllers, could vary from Sonys projections.  The continued expansion of online network cash flows, building upon the networking or functionality of the PS3 and other Sony products, leading to user fees, software, music and video download revenue and ancillary revenue is uncertain and is based on limited historical experience coupled with industry projections. The future growth of the game console installed base, future royalty rates, overall online market growth and the ability to realize synergies from other Sony businesses as connectivity between non-gaming devices increases is projected to exceed revenue reductions resulting from lower sales of older models of game consoles and related software. Such future growth is uncertain and may vary from Sonys estimates.  The timing and level of research and development cash flows for future investments required to provide products that maintain competitiveness could vary from Sonys projections. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis summarized above, actual results may differ which could significantly alter the fair value of the reporting unit. The uncertainties described above were considered when selecting the perpetual growth rate, which was set after an initial three-year forecasted period, and the discount rate used in the fair value calculation as described above. The perpetual growth rate applied to determine fair value was 1.5 percent, which was based on historical experience as well as anticipated economic conditions, industry data and Sonys long term outlook for the business. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. The discount rate, applied to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit, was 7.6 percent and considered the weighted-average cost of capital of market participants in similar businesses. Changes in the financial markets, such as an increase in interest rates or an increase in the expected required return on equity by market participants within the industry, could increase the discount rate, thus decreasing the fair value of the reporting unit. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value estimate as it relates to the discount and perpetual growth rates, Sony hypothetically assumed, while holding all other assumptions constant, a combination of a one percentage point increase in the discount rate and a one percentage point decrease in the perpetual growth rate used, both of which would result in lower estimates of fair value, and concluded that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would continue to substantially exceed the carrying value. Pension benefit costs Employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on certain assumptions including discount rates, retirement rates and mortality rates, which are based upon current statistical data, as well as expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets and other factors. Specifically, the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets are two critical assumptions in the determination of periodic pension costs and pension liabilities. Assumptions are evaluated at least annually, or at the time when events occur or circumstances change and these events or changes could have a significant effect on these critical assumptions. 84 Table of Contents In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. Therefore, actual results generally affect recognized costs and the recorded obligations for pensions in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys pension obligations and future costs. Sonys principal pension plans are its Japanese pension plans. No individual foreign pension plan is significant to consolidated pension plan assets and pension obligations. To determine the benefit obligation of the Japanese pension plans, Sony used a discount rate of 2.3 percent for its Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2010. The discount rate was determined by using information about rates of return on high-quality fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit obligation in consideration of amounts and timing of cash outflows for expected benefit payments. Such available information about rates of returns is collected from published market information and credit rating agencies. The 2.3 percent discount rate represents a 10 basis point increase from the 2.2 percent discount rate used for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 and reflects current Japanese market interest rate conditions. For Japanese pension plans, a 10 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension costs by approximately 0.8 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, Sony considers the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on various categories of pension plan assets. Sonys pension investment policy recognizes the expected growth and the variability risk associated with the long term nature of pension liabilities, the returns and risks of diversification across asset classes, and the correlation among assets. The asset allocations are designed to maximize returns consistent with levels of liquidity and investment risk that are considered prudent and reasonable. While the pension investment policy gives appropriate consideration to recent market performance and historical returns, the investment assumptions utilized by Sony are designed to achieve a long term return consistent with the long term nature of the corresponding pension liabilities. For Japanese pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 3.9 percent and 3.6 percent as of March 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The actual return on pension plan assets for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 was a 16.2 percent loss and a 12.4 percent gain, respectively. Actual results that differ from the expected return on pension plan assets are accumulated and amortized as a component of pension costs over the average future service period, thereby reducing the year-to-year volatility in pension costs. As of March 31, 2009 and 2010, Sony had, with respect to Japanese pension plans, net actuarial losses of 338.0 billion yen and 270.2 billion yen, respectively, including losses related to pension plan assets. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, the net actuarial loss decreased since the actual rate of return on pension plan assets exceeds the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The following table illustrates the effect on the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 of changes in the discount rate and the expected return on pension plan assets, while holding all other assumptions as of March 31, 2010 constant, for Japanese pension plans. Projected Benefit Obligations Pension Equity Change in Assumption (Pre-Tax) Costs (Net of Tax) (Yen in billions) 25 basis point increase / decrease in discount rate −/+27.9 −/+2.0 +/−1.2 25 basis point increase / decrease in expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets  −/+1.3 +/−0.7 Deferred tax asset valuation Carrying amounts of deferred tax assets require a reduction by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically with appropriate consideration given to all 85 Table of Contents positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. Managements judgments related to this assessment consider, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses on an individual tax jurisdiction basis, forecasts of future profitability after consideration of uncertain tax positions, excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of net assets, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, Sonys experience with operating loss carryforwards not expiring unused, as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies which would be employed by Sony, if necessary, to prevent net operating loss carryforwards from expiring unutilized. As a result of losses incurred in recent years, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. (SCEA), Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Limited (SCEE) and Sony United Kingdom Ltd. (SUKL) are each in a three year cumulative pre-tax loss position. On April 1, 2010, as a part of the business restructuring and formation of a new business unit, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI) contributed its game business to a new company and SCEI which operates the network business which had not been contributed, was merged into Sony Corporation after the change of its trade name. Immediately following the Japan restructuring, SCEA was merged into a new entity, a subsidiary of Sonys U.S. holding company, Sony Americas Holding Inc. (SAHI). As a consequence of these reorganizations, the deferred tax assets of SCEI and SCEA are evaluated in the context of the new structure. A cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset. Sony has concluded that there is sufficient positive evidence to overcome this negative evidence when considering both the reorganization on April 1, 2010 and the use of tax planning strategies. The tax planning strategies include transactions among certain businesses with historically strong earnings and the loss businesses as well as the sales of certain assets that could realize the excess of appreciated value over the tax basis of those assets. Sony believes that the tax planning strategies coupled with future earnings forecasts of the historically profitable entities would produce sufficient taxable income in the legal entities in the future to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2010 (in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan), notwithstanding that some of the expected profitable businesses incurred losses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 , as a result of the dramatic changes in worldwide economic conditions, the strengthening of the yen, and restructuring actions undertaken by Sony. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded for these entities as of March 31, 2010. Notwithstanding the above, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be significantly reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income from the tax planning strategies and forecasted earnings during the tax loss carryforward period are significantly lower than currently estimated due to deterioration in economic conditions or Sonys failure to achieve its restructuring objectives. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable as it relates to SCEA, SCEE and SUKL take into account the uncertain tax positions related to the more likely than not adjustments for Sonys intercompany transfer pricing. Such transfer pricing is currently under review by the relevant governments as a result of a competent authority request and applications for Bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) filed in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. Sony is required to estimate the final outcome of those government to government negotiations in recording its tax positions, including the allocation and amount of deferred tax assets among the various legal entities as of March 31, 2010. It is possible that the advance pricing agreement negotiations could result in a different allocation of profits and losses than those estimated by management, and that such allocation could have an adverse impact on the realizability of Sonys deferred tax assets. Sony may record adjustments to its provision for uncertain tax positions, and, accordingly, its valuation allowance assessments, as additional evidence becomes available. The estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets, which is based on current tax laws and rates in effect as of March 31, 2010, reflects managements judgment and best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in Sonys financial statements and tax returns, the ability to implement various tax planning strategies and, in certain cases, future forecasts, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results, and market or economic deterioration or failure of management to achieve its restructuring objectives could affect future business results, either of which could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. If future results are less than projected, if APA negotiations result in a different allocation of profits and losses than currently anticipated, if tax planning alternatives are no longer viable, or if there is no excess appreciated asset value over the tax basis of the assets contemplated for sale, further valuation allowance may be required in the future to reduce the deferred tax assets to 86 Table of Contents their net realizable value. These factors and other changes that are not anticipated in current estimates could have a material impact on Sonys earnings or financial condition in the period or periods in which they are recorded. Film accounting An aspect of film accounting that requires the exercise of judgment relates to the process of estimating the total revenues to be received throughout a films life cycle. Such estimate of a films ultimate revenue is important for two reasons. First, while a film is being produced and the related costs are being capitalized, it is necessary for management to estimate the ultimate revenue, less additional costs to be incurred, including exploitation costs which are expensed as incurred, in order to determine whether the value of a film has been impaired and thus requires an immediate write off of unrecoverable film costs. Second, the amount of film costs recognized as cost of sales for a given film as it is exhibited in various markets throughout its life cycle is based upon the proportion that current period actual revenues bear to the estimated ultimate total revenues. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on several factors including the historical performance of similar genre films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses, the expected number of theaters at which the film will be released, anticipated performance in the home entertainment, television and other ancillary markets, and agreements for future sales. Management updates such estimates on a regular basis based on the actual results to date and estimated future results for each film. For example, a film that has resulted in lower than expected theatrical revenues in its initial weeks of release would generally have its theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution ultimate revenues adjusted downward; a failure to do so would result in the understatement of amortized film costs for the period. Future insurance policy benefits Liabilities for future insurance policy benefits are established in amounts adequate to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force. These liabilities, which require significant management judgment and estimates, are computed by the net level premium method based upon the assumptions as to future investment yield, morbidity, mortality, withdrawals and other factors. Future policy benefits are computed using interest rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 4.7 percent and are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Morbidity, mortality and withdrawal assumptions for all policies are based on either the subsidiarys own experience or various actuarial tables. Generally these assumptions are locked-in throughout the life of the contract upon the issuance of new insurance, although significant changes in experience or assumptions may require Sony to provide for expected future losses. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Fair value measurements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance for fair value measurements. This guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. This guidance is applicable to other accounting guidance that requires or permits fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued supplemental guidance that partially delayed the effective date of the guidance for fair value measurements for Sony until April 1, 2009 for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities and removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of the guidance. In addition, in October 2008, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the application of fair value measurements in a market that is not active, and was effective upon issuance. On April 1, 2008, Sony adopted the new accounting guidance for fair value measurements with regards to financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of the guidance for fair value measurements did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Accounting for collaborative arrangements In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for collaborative arrangements, which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes accounting and reporting requirements for transactions between 87 Table of Contents participants in the arrangement and third parties. A collaborative arrangement is defined as a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity. Sony adopted the provisions of this guidance, which are being applied retrospectively to all periods presented, for all collaborative arrangements on April 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Business combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for business combinations, which principally applies on a prospective basis to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after April 1, 2009. This guidance requires that the acquisition method of accounting be applied to a broader range of business combinations, amends the definition of a business combination, provides a definition of a business, requires an acquirer to recognize an acquired business at its fair value at the acquisition date, and requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be measured and recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date, with limited exceptions. Also, under this guidance, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense in periods subsequent to the acquisition date. Adjustments made to valuation allowances of deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to April 1, 2009 would also apply the provisions of this guidance with subsequent adjustments reflected through the results of operations. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. In April 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies. This guidance addresses the initial recognition, measurement and subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination, and requires that such assets acquired or liabilities assumed be initially recognized at fair value at the acquisition date if fair value can be determined during the measurement period. If the acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined, the asset acquired or liability assumed arising from a contingency is recognized only if certain criteria are met. For Sony, this guidance is effective for assets acquired or liabilities assumed arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after April 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. This guidance requires that the noncontrolling interests in the equity of a subsidiary be accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance on the treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires additional disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the controlling and noncontrolling owners. As required, Sony adopted this guidance on April 1, 2009, via retrospective application of the financial statement presentation and related disclosure requirements. Upon the adoption of this guidance, noncontrolling interests, which were previously referred to as minority interest and classified between total liabilities and stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets, are now included as a separate component of total equity. In addition, the net income (loss) on the consolidated statements of income now includes the net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Consistent with the retrospective application required by this guidance, the prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified or adjusted to conform to the current presentation. As a result of the reclassifications, the stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year ended at March 31, 2009 has increased by 251,949 million yen and the net income on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 has decreased by 5,779 million yen and the net loss on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 has increased by 3,276 million yen. In January 2010, the FASB issued supplemental guidance clarifying the accounting for decreases in ownership interests and expanding the disclosure requirements about the deconsolidation of a subsidiary or deconsolidation of a group of assets. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. 88 Table of Contents Determination of the useful life of intangible assets In April 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the determination of the useful life of intangible assets, which amends the list of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets. This new guidance applies to (1) intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and (2) intangible assets acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions. Under this new guidance, entities estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or, in the absence of historical experience, must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension. For Sony, this new guidance applies to intangible assets acquired after March 31, 2009. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Equity method investment accounting considerations In November 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance, which addresses certain effects that the guidance for business combinations and noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements has on an entitys accounting for equity-method investments. This guidance indicates, among other things, that transaction costs for an investment should be included in the cost of the equity-method investment (and not expensed) and shares subsequently issued by the equity-method investee that reduce the investors ownership percentage should be accounted for as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment, with gains or losses recorded through earnings. Sony adopted this guidance on April 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Postretirement benefit plan asset disclosures In December 2008, the FASB issued new disclosure guidance regarding postretirement benefit plan assets. This guidance requires additional disclosures about plan assets for sponsors of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans including expanded information regarding investment strategies, major classes of plan assets, and concentrations of risk within plan assets. Additionally, this guidance requires disclosures similar to those required for fair value measurements with respect to the fair value of plan assets such as the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and information with respect to classification of plan assets in terms of the hierarchy of the source of information used to determine their value. For Sony, the disclosures under this guidance are required beginning with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, but are not required for the earlier periods. Since this guidance impacts only disclosure, its adoption has no impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. The additional disclosures are included in Note 15 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities In April 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities. This guidance is intended to provide greater clarity to investors about the credit and noncredit component of an other-than-temporary impairment event and to more effectively communicate when an other-than-temporary impairment event has occurred. This guidance requires the separate display of losses related to credit deterioration and losses related to other market factors. When an entity does not intend to sell a debt security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not have to sell the debt security before recovery of its cost basis, it must recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. In addition, upon the adoption of this guidance, an entity is required to record a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the period of adoption to reclassify the noncredit component of a previously recognized other-than-temporary impairment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income. Sony adopted this guidance on April 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Fair value measurements when there is no active market In April 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for determining fair value when there is no active market for an asset or when the pricing inputs used in determining the fair value of an asset represent a distressed sale. This guidance also reaffirms that the objective of fair value measurement is to reflect an assets sale price in an orderly transaction at the date of the financial statements. This guidance was effective for Sony as of April 1, 2009, 89 Table of Contents and was applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Accounting Standards Codification In June 2009, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification). The Codification became the single source for all authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB. The Codification is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Codification does not change U.S. GAAP and did not have an effect on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Measuring liabilities at fair value In August 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for measuring liabilities at fair value. This guidance clarifies how the fair value measurement principles should be applied to measuring liabilities carried at fair value. This guidance describes how to measure liabilities at fair value when quoted prices for identical liabilities in active markets are not available and clarifies that an entity should not make an adjustment to fair value for a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. This guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after issuance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent) In September 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). This guidance permits, as a practical expedient, an entity to measure the fair value of an investment using the net asset value per share of the investment (or its equivalent) provided by the investee without further adjustment if the investment companies do not have readily determinable fair values as is the case with certain alternative investment funds. This guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ended after December 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Fair value measurements disclosures In January 2010, the FASB issued new disclosure guidance regarding fair value measurements. This guidance adds new requirements for disclosures related to transfers into and out of level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy, and separate disclosures about purchase, sales, issuances, and settlements relating to level 3 investment measurements. It also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation, as well as inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the level 3 activity of purchase, sales, issuance, and settlements on a gross basis, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Since this guidance impacts disclosures only, its adoption has no impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Multiple element arrangements and software deliverables In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of the vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on managements best estimate of the selling prices. In addition, the guidance eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation. Also in October 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements. Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements. While it is mandatory for Sony to adopt this new guidance prospectively for 90 Table of Contents revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning April 1, 2011, early adoption is permitted. Sony is currently evaluating the potential early adoption of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Transfers of financial assets In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets. This guidance amends previous guidance by including: the elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) concept; a new participating interest definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting; clarifications and changes to the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale; and a change to the amount of recognized gain or loss on a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor. Additionally, the guidance requires new disclosures regarding an entitys involvement in a transfer of financial assets. Finally, existing QSPEs must be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance upon the elimination of this concept. This guidance is effective for Sony as of April 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Variable interest entities In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity (VIE). This guidance changes the approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE from a quantitative risk and reward model to a qualitative model based on control, and requires an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary. This guidance is effective for Sony as of April 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Item 6.

Of the 98 Table of Contents amount Sony Corporation paid as Retirement Allowances, the amount paid under the Phantom Restricted Stock Plan was calculated using the average market price of Sony Corporations common stock for ten consecutive business days immediately prior to the date of resignation (June 18, 2010). For details of the Phantom Restricted Stock Plan, please see item (3) Basic policy regarding remuneration for Directors and Corporate Executive Officers below. **** This amount does not include certain expenditures by Sony that either do not provide an economic benefit to the affected officers, including those incurred as a result of the imposition of income taxes on the relevant officers concurrently in the U.S. and Japan, or are related to the performance of an executives duties. The same applies to table (2) below. ***** The amount includes bonuses linked to business results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 that were paid in June 2010, but excludes the amount paid in June 2009 as bonuses linked to business results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (a total of 74 million yen for 4 Corporate Executive Officers). ****** In addition to the above, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 Sony Corporation issued Stock Acquisition Rights for the purpose of granting stock options to Directors and Corporate Executive Officers and recorded 15 million yen in expenses for Directors (15 million yen for Outside Directors) and 578 million yen in expenses for Corporate Executive Officers.

Refer to Note 17 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page F-62 of this report for details. The weighted-average fair value per share does not indicate the actual value that would be realized by a Director or Corporate Executive Officer upon the exercise of the above-mentioned stock acquisition rights. The actual value, if any, that is realized by a Director or Corporate Executive Officer upon the exercise of any stock acquisition rights will depend on the extent to which the market value of Sony Corporations Common Stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock acquisition rights on the date of exercise, and several other restrictions imposed on the exercise of the stock acquisition rights, including the period when a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer could exercise the stock acquisition rights. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the value realized or to be realized by a Director or Corporate Executive Officer upon the exercise of the stock acquisition rights is or will be at or near the weighted-average fair value per share presented above. In addition, the above weighted-average fair value per share was calculated to recognize compensation expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 for accounting purposes and should not be regarded as any indication or predictor of future stock performance. ** Apart from the remuneration contained in the above table, Sony also provided certain of its Corporate Executive Officers with certain personal benefits and perquisites, including fringe benefits (and in some instances the Company paid the Executive Officers income taxes related to their perquisites), during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010: for Howard Stringer Chairman, CEO & President, Sony Corporation  7 million yen / Sony Corporation of America  4 million yen; for Nicole Seligman EVP, Sony Corporation  10 million yen / Sony Corporation of America  5 million yen; and for Kazuo Hirai EVP, Sony Corporation  3 million yen / Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.  3 million yen. 100 Table of Contents (3) Basic policy regarding remuneration for Directors and Corporate Executive Officers The basic policy regarding remuneration for Directors and Corporate Executive Officers, as determined by the Compensation Committee, is as follows: (a) Basic policy of Director remuneration Taking into account that the main duty of the Directors is to supervise the performance of business operations of Sony and the fact that Sony Corporation is a global company, in order to improve such function of the Directors, the following two elements constitute the basic policy for the determination of the remuneration of Directors:  Attracting and retaining an adequate talent pool of Directors possessing the requisite abilities to excel in the global marketplace; and  Ensuring the effectiveness of the supervisory function of the Directors Based upon the above, the remuneration of Directors shall consist of the following three components:  Fixed remuneration;  Remuneration linked to share price; and  Phantom Restricted Stock Plan.

Board Practices Sony Corporation has adopted a Company with Committees corporate governance system under the Companies Act of Japan (Kaishaho) and related regulations (collectively the Companies Act). Under this system, Sony Corporation has three committees: the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Under the Companies Act, each committee is required to consist of not less than three Directors, the majority of whom must be outside Directors. In order to qualify as an outside Director under the Companies Act, a Director must be a person (i) who is not a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiaries, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) who has never been a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiaries, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Under the committee system, Directors as such have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except for limited circumstances as permitted by law. The Board of Directors must elect Corporate Executive Officers (Shikko-yaku), who are responsible for the execution of the business of Sony Corporation. A summary of the governance system adopted by Sony Corporation is set forth below. The Board of Directors determines fundamental management policy and other important matters related to the management of Sony and oversees the performance of the duties of Directors and Corporate Executive Officers. Furthermore, the Board of Directors has the power and authority to appoint and dismiss the members of Sony Corporations three committees and Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Companies Act, all Directors must be elected at the General Meeting of Shareholders from the candidates determined by the Nominating Committee. Under the Companies Act, the term of office of Directors expires at the conclusion of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. Directors may serve any number of consecutive terms although, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, outside Directors may not be reelected more than five times without the consent of all Directors nor more than eight times even if the consent of all Directors is obtained. Yotaro Kobayashi and Yoshiaki Yamauchi were each reelected for a seventh term as an outside Director at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 18, 2010 upon nomination by the Nominating Committee with the consent of all Directors pursuant to the Charter of the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors must appoint one or more Corporate Executive Officers who are authorized to determine matters delegated to them by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Executive Officers are responsible for conducting all the business operations of Sony within the scope of authority delegated by the Board of Directors. As of June 18, 2010, there are eight Corporate Executive Officers, some of whom are also Directors. Significant decision-making authority has been delegated to the CEO and also to each Corporate Executive Officer with respect to investments, strategic alliances and other actions related to the execution of business operations.

Financial Information Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information Refer to the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Legal Proceedings In October 2009, Sony Corporations U.S. subsidiary, Sony Optiarc America Inc., received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division seeking information about its optical disk drive business. Sony Corporation understands that the DOJ and agencies outside the United States are investigating competition in optical disk drives. Sony Corporation intends to cooperate fully with the DOJ and other agencies in this inquiry. Subsequently, a number of purported class action lawsuits were filed in certain jurisdictions, including the United States, in which the plaintiffs allege that Sony Corporation, Sony Optiarc Inc., Sony Optiarc America Inc., other named defendants and other unnamed parties violated antitrust laws and seek recovery of damages and other remedies. In addition, Sony Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants or otherwise involved in other pending legal and regulatory proceedings. However, based upon the information currently available to Sony and its legal counsel, the management of Sony believes that the outcome from such legal and regulatory proceedings would not have a material effect on Sonys consolidated financial statements. Dividend Policy Sony believes that continuously increasing corporate value and providing dividends are essential to rewarding shareholders. It is Sonys policy to utilize retained earnings, after ensuring the perpetuation of stable dividends, to carry out various investments that contribute to an increase in corporate value such as those that ensure future growth and strengthen competitiveness. A fiscal year-end dividend of 12.5 yen per share of Common Stock was approved at the Board of Directors meeting held on May 12, 2010 and was paid on June 2, 2010. Sony Corporation has already paid an interim dividend for Common Stock of 12.5 yen per share to each shareholder; accordingly, the total annual dividend per share of Common Stock for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 is 25.0 yen. Significant Changes No significant change has occurred since the date of the annual financial statements included in this annual report. Item 9.

Additional Information Share Capital Not Applicable Memorandum and Articles of Association Organization Sony Corporation is a joint stock corporation (Kabushiki Kaisha) incorporated in Japan under the Companies Act (Kaishaho) of Japan. It is registered in the Commercial Register (Shogyo Tokibo) maintained by the Minato Branch Office of the Tokyo Bureau of Legal Affairs. Objects and purposes The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that its purpose is to engage in the following business activities: (i) manufacture and sale of electronic and electrical machines and equipment, medical instruments, optical instruments and other equipment, machines and instruments; (ii) planning, production and sale of audio-visual software and computer software programs; (iii) manufacture and sale of metal industrial products, chemical industrial products and ceramic industrial products, textile products, paper products and wood-crafted articles, daily necessities, foodstuffs and toys, transportation machines, equipment, petroleum and coal products; (iv) real estate activities, construction business, transportation business and warehousing business; (v) publishing business and printing business; (vi) advertising agency business, insurance agency business, broadcasting enterprise, recreation business such as travel, management of sporting facilities, etc. and other service enterprises; (vii) financial business; (viii) Type I and Type II telecommunications business under the Telecommunications Business Law; (ix) investing in stocks and bonds, etc.; (x) manufacture, sale, export and import of products which are incidental to or related to those mentioned above; (xi) rendering of services related to those mentioned above; (xii) investment in businesses mentioned above operated by other companies or persons; and (xiii) all businesses which are incidental to or related to those mentioned above. 110 Table of Contents Directors Under the Companies Act, Directors have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except in limited circumstances as permitted by law. If a Director also serves concurrently as a Corporate Executive Officer, then he or she can execute the business of Sony Corporation in the capacity of Corporate Executive Officer. Under the Companies Act, Directors must refrain from engaging in any business competing with Sony Corporation unless approved by the Board of Directors, and any Director who has a material interest in the subject matter of a resolution to be taken by the Board of Directors cannot vote on such resolution. The amount of remuneration to each Director is determined by the Compensation Committee, which consists of Directors, the majority of whom are outside Directors (Refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees). No member of the Compensation Committee may vote on a resolution with respect to his or her own compensation as a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer. Neither the Companies Act nor Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation make a special provision as to the borrowing powers exercisable by Directors (subject to requisite internal authorizations as required by the Companies Act), their retirement age, or a requirement to hold any shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. For more information on Directors, refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees. Capital stock (General) Unless indicated otherwise, set forth below is information relating to Sony Corporations capital stock, including brief summaries of the relevant provisions of Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation and Share Handling Regulations, currently in effect, and of the Companies Act and related regulations. On January 5, 2009, a central book-entry transfer system for shares of Japanese listed companies was established pursuant to the Act Concerning Book-entry Transfer of Corporate Bonds, Shares etc. (Book-entry Transfer Act), and this system is applied to the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation. Under this system, shares of all Japanese companies listed on any Japanese stock exchange are dematerialized, and shareholders must have accounts at account management institutions to hold their shares unless such shareholder has an account at Japan Securities Depository Center, Inc. (JASDEC). Account management institutions are financial instruments traders (i.e., securities companies), banks, trust companies and certain other financial institutions that meet the requirements prescribed by the Book-entry Transfer Act. Transfer of the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation is effected exclusively through entry in the records maintained by JASDEC and the account management institutions, and title to the shares passes to the transferee at the time when the transfer of the shares is recorded at the transferees account at an account management institution. The holder of an account at an account management institution is presumed to be the legal holder of the shares recorded in such account. Under the Companies Act and the Book-entry Transfer Act, in order to assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation, a shareholder of shares must have its name and address registered in Sony Corporations register of shareholders. Under the central book-entry transfer system operated by JASDEC, shareholders shall notify the relevant account management institutions of certain information prescribed under the Book-entry Transfer Act or Sony Corporations Share Handling Regulations, including their names and addresses, and the registration on Sony Corporations register of shareholders is updated upon receipt by Sony Corporation of necessary information from JASDEC (as described in Record date). On the other hand, in order to assert shareholders rights to which shareholders are entitled regardless of record dates such as minority shareholders rights, including the right to propose a matter to be considered at a General Meeting of Shareholders, except for shareholders rights to request that Sony Corporation purchase or sell shares constituting less than a full unit (as described in Unit share system), JASDEC shall, upon the shareholders request, issue a notice of certain information, including the name and address of such shareholder, to Sony Corporation. Thereafter, such shareholder is required to present Sony Corporation a receipt of the notice request in accordance with the Sony Corporations Share Handling Regulations. Under the Book-entry Transfer Act, the shareholder shall exercise such shareholders right within four weeks after notice has been given. 111 Table of Contents Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation is the transfer agent for Sony Corporations capital stock. As such, it keeps Sony Corporations registers of shareholders in its office at 4-5, Marunouchi 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. Non-resident shareholders are required to appoint a standing proxy in Japan or file notice of a mailing address in Japan. Notices from Sony Corporation to non-resident shareholders are delivered to such standing proxies or mailing address. Japanese securities companies and commercial banks customarily act as standing proxies and provide related services for standard fees. The recorded holder of deposited shares underlying the American Depositary Shares (ADSs) is the depositary for the ADSs. Accordingly, holders of ADSs will not be able to directly assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation. (Authorized capital) Under the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may only issue shares of Common Stock. Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide that the total number of shares authorized to be issued by Sony Corporation is 3.6 billion shares. All shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation have no par value. All issued shares are fully-paid and non-assessable. (Distribution of Surplus) Distribution of Surplus  General Under the Companies Act, distributions of cash or other assets by joint stock corporations to their shareholders, so called dividends, are referred to as distributions of Surplus (Surplus is defined in  Restriction on distributions of Surplus). Sony Corporation may make distributions of Surplus to shareholders any number of times per business year, subject to certain limitations described in  Restriction on distributions of Surplus. Distributions of Surplus are required in principle to be authorized by a resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders, but Sony Corporation may authorize distributions of Surplus by a resolution of the Board of Directors as long as its non-consolidated annual financial statements and certain documents for the last business year present fairly its assets and profit or loss, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. Distributions of Surplus may be made in cash or in kind in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each shareholder. A resolution of the Board of Directors or a General Meeting of Shareholders authorizing a distribution of Surplus must specify the kind and aggregate book value of the assets to be distributed, the manner of allocation of such assets to shareholders, and the effective date of the distribution. If a distribution of Surplus is to be made in kind, Sony Corporation may, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or (as the case may be) a General Meeting of Shareholders, grant a right to the shareholders to require Sony Corporation to make such distribution in cash instead of in kind. If no such right is granted to shareholders, the relevant distribution of Surplus must be approved by a special resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders (refer to Voting rights with respect to a special resolution). Under the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, year-end dividends and interim dividends may be distributed to shareholders appearing in Sony Corporations register of shareholders as of March 31 and September 30 each year, respectively, in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each shareholder following approval by the Board of Directors or (as the case may be) the General Meeting of Shareholders. Sony Corporation is not obliged to pay any dividends unclaimed for a period of five years after the date on which they first became payable. In Japan, the ex-dividend date and the record date for dividends precede the date of determination of the amount of the dividends to be paid. The price of the shares of Common Stock generally goes ex-dividend on the second business day prior to the record date. Distribution of Surplus  Restriction on distribution of Surplus In making a distribution of Surplus, Sony Corporation must, until the sum of its additional paid-in capital and legal reserve reaches one quarter of its stated capital, set aside in its additional paid-in capital and/or legal reserve an amount equal to one-tenth of the amount of Surplus so distributed. 112 Table of Contents The amount of Surplus at any given time must be calculated in accordance with the following formula: A + B + C + D − (E + F + G) In the above formula: A = the total amount of other capital surplus and other retained earnings, each such amount being that appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year B = (if Sony Corporation has disposed of its treasury stock after the end of the last business year) the amount of the consideration for such treasury stock received by Sony Corporation less the book value thereof C = (if Sony Corporation has reduced its stated capital after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (if any) D = (if Sony Corporation has reduced its additional paid-in capital or legal reserve after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to stated capital (if any) E = (if Sony Corporation has cancelled its treasury stock after the end of the last business year) the book value of such treasury stock F = (if Sony Corporation has distributed Surplus to its shareholders after the end of the last business year) the total book value of the Surplus so distributed G = certain other amounts set forth in ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if Sony Corporation has reduced Surplus and increased its stated capital, additional paid-in capital or legal reserve after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction and (if Sony Corporation has distributed Surplus to the shareholders after the end of the last business year) the amount set aside in additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (if any) as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. The aggregate book value of Surplus distributed by Sony Corporation may not exceed a prescribed distributable amount (the Distributable Amount), as calculated on the effective date of such distribution. The Distributable Amount at any given time shall be equal to the amount of Surplus less the aggregate of the followings: (a) the book value of its treasury stock; (b) the amount of consideration for any of treasury stock disposed of by Sony Corporation after the end of the last business year; and (c) certain other amounts set forth in ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if the sum of one-half of goodwill and the deferred assets exceeds the total of stated capital, additional paid-in capital and legal reserve, each such amount being that appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year) all or certain part of such exceeding amount as calculated in accordance with ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. As Sony Corporation has become a company with respect to which consolidated balance sheets should also be considered in the calculation of the Distributable Amount (renketsu haito kisei tekiyo kaisha), Sony Corporation must further deduct from the amount of Surplus the excess amount, if any, of (x) the total amount of stockholders equity appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year and certain other amounts set forth by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice over (y) the total amount of stockholders equity and certain other amounts set forth by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice appearing on the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year. If Sony Corporation has prepared interim financial statements as described below, and if such interim financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors or (if so required by the Companies Act) by a General Meeting of Shareholders, then the Distributable Amount must be adjusted to take into account the amount of profit 113 Table of Contents or loss, and the amount of consideration for any of the treasury stock disposed of by Sony Corporation, during the period in respect of which such interim financial statements have been prepared. Sony Corporation may prepare non-consolidated interim financial statements consisting of a balance sheet as of any date subsequent to the end of the last business year and an income statement for the period from the first day of the current business year to the date of such balance sheet. Interim financial statements so prepared by Sony Corporation must be audited by the Audit Committee and the independent auditor, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. (Capital and reserves) Sony Corporation may generally reduce its additional paid-in capital or legal reserve by resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders and, if so decided by the same resolution, may account for the whole or any part of the amount of such reduction as stated capital. On the other hand, Sony Corporation may generally reduce its stated capital by a special resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders and, if so decided by the same resolution, may account for the whole or any part of the amount of such reduction as additional paid-in capital. In addition, Sony Corporation may reduce its Surplus and increase either (i) stated capital or (ii) additional paid-in capital and/or legal reserve by the same amount, in either case by resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders. (Stock splits) Sony Corporation may at any time split shares in issue into a greater number of shares at the determination of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and may amend its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of the authorized shares to be issued to allow such stock split pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or a determination by a Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors, rather than relying on a special shareholders resolution, which is otherwise required for amending the Articles of Incorporation. When a stock split is to be made, Sony Corporation must give public notice of the stock split, specifying the record date thereof, at least two weeks prior to such record date. Under the central book-entry transfer system operated by JASDEC, Sony Corporation must also give notice to JASDEC regarding a stock split at least two weeks prior to the relevant effective date of the stock split. On the effective date of the stock split, the numbers of shares recorded in all accounts held by Sony Corporations shareholders at account managing institutions or JASDEC will be increased in accordance with the applicable ratio. (Consolidation of shares) Sony Corporation may at any time consolidate issued shares into a smaller number of shares by the special shareholders resolution (as defined in ( Voting rights). When a consolidation of shares is to be made, Sony Corporation must give public notice or notice to each shareholder at least two weeks prior to the effective date of the consolidation of shares. Under the central book-entry transfer system operated by JASDEC, Sony Corporation must also give notice to JASDEC regarding a consolidation of shares at least two weeks prior to the effective date of the consolidation of shares. On the effective date of the consolidation of shares, the numbers of shares recorded in all accounts held by Sony Corporations shareholders at account managing institutions or JASDEC will be decreased in accordance with the applicable ratio. Sony Corporation must disclose the reason for the consolidation of shares at a General Meeting of Shareholders. (General Meeting of Shareholders) The Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of Sony Corporation for each business year is normally held in June of each year in Tokyo, Japan. In addition, Sony Corporation may hold an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders whenever necessary by giving notice thereof at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Notice of a shareholders meeting setting forth the place, time and purpose thereof must be mailed to each shareholder having voting rights (or, in the case of a non-resident shareholder, to such shareholders resident proxy or mailing address in Japan) at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Under the Companies Act, such notice may be given to shareholders by electronic means, subject to obtaining consent by the relevant shareholders. The record date for an Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders is March 31 of each year. 114 Table of Contents Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least three percent of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months or more may require the convocation of a General Meeting of Shareholders for a particular purpose. Unless such a shareholders meeting is convened promptly or a convocation notice of a meeting which is to be held not later than eight weeks from the day of such demand is dispatched, the requiring shareholder may, upon obtaining a court approval, convene such a shareholders meeting. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least 300 voting rights or one percent of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months or more may propose a matter to be considered at a General Meeting of Shareholders by submitting a written request to Sony Corporation at least eight weeks prior to the date set for such meeting. If the Articles of Incorporation so provide, any of the minimum voting rights or percentages, time periods and number of voting rights necessary for exercising the minority shareholder rights described above may be decreased or shortened. Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation currently do not include any such provisions. (Voting rights) So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, a holder of shares constituting one or more units is entitled to one vote for each such unit of stock (refer to (Unit share system) below; currently 100 shares constitute one unit), except that no voting rights with respect to shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation are afforded to Sony Corporation or any corporate or certain other entity more than one-quarter of the total voting rights of which are directly or indirectly held by Sony Corporation. If Sony Corporation eliminates from its Articles of Incorporation the provisions relating to units of stock, holders of capital stock will have one vote for each share they hold. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, a resolution can be adopted at a General Meeting of Shareholders by a majority of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting. The Companies Act and Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide, however, that the quorum for the election of Directors shall be one-third of the total number of voting rights of all the shareholders. Sony Corporations shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of Directors. Shareholders may cast their votes in writing and may also exercise their voting rights through proxies, provided that the proxies are also shareholders holding voting rights. Shareholders may also exercise their voting rights by electronic means pursuant to the method designated by Sony Corporation. The Companies Act of Japan and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that in order to amend the Articles of Incorporation and in certain other instances, including: (1) acquisition of its own shares from a specific party other than its subsidiaries; (2) consolidation of shares; (3) any offering of new shares at a specially favorable price (or any offering of stock acquisition rights to acquire shares of capital stock, or bonds with stock acquisition rights on specially favorable conditions) to any persons other than shareholders; (4) the exemption of liability of a Director, Corporate Executive Officer or independent auditor with certain exceptions; (5) a reduction of stated capital with certain exceptions; (6) a distribution of in-kind dividends which meets certain requirements; (7) dissolution, merger, consolidation, or corporate split with certain exceptions; (8) the transfer of the whole or a material part of the business; (9) the taking over of the whole of the business of any other corporation with certain exceptions; or (10) share exchange or share transfer for the purpose of establishing 100 percent parent-subsidiary relationships with certain exceptions, 115 Table of Contents the quorum shall be one-third of the total number of voting rights of all the shareholders, and the approval by at least two-thirds of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting is required (the special shareholders resolutions). (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) Holders of Sony Corporations shares of capital stock have no pre-emptive rights under its Articles of Incorporation. Authorized but unissued shares may be issued at such times and upon such terms as the Board of Directors or the CEO determines, subject to the limitations as to the offering of new shares at a specially favorable price mentioned under ( Voting rights) above. In the case of an issuance of shares (including a transfer to treasury shares) of Sony Corporation or its stock acquisition rights by way of an allotment to a third party which would dilute the outstanding voting shares by 25 percent or more or change the controlling shareholder, in addition to a resolution of the Board of Directors, the approval of the shareholders or an affirmative vote from a person independent of the management is generally required pursuant to the regulations of the Japanese stock exchanges on which shares of Sony Corporation are listed. The Board of Directors or the CEO may, however, determine that shareholders shall be given subscription rights regarding a particular issue of new shares, in which case such rights must be given on uniform terms to all shareholders as of a record date of which not less than two weeks prior public notice is given. Each of the shareholders to whom such rights are given must also be given notice of the expiry thereof at least two weeks prior to the date on which such rights expire. Subject to certain conditions, Sony Corporation may issue stock acquisition rights by a resolution of the Board of Directors or a determination by the CEO. Holders of stock acquisition rights may exercise their rights to acquire a certain number of shares within the exercise period as prescribed in the terms of their stock acquisition rights. Upon exercise of stock acquisition rights, Sony Corporation will be obliged to issue the relevant number of new shares or alternatively to transfer the necessary number of treasury stock held by it. In cases where a particular issue of new shares or stock acquisition rights (i) violates laws and regulations or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation, or (ii) will be performed in a manner materially unfair, and shareholders may suffer disadvantages therefrom, such shareholders may file an injunction to enjoin such issue with a court. (Liquidation rights) In the event of a liquidation of Sony Corporation, the assets remaining after payment of all debts, liquidation expenses and taxes will be distributed among the holders of shares of Common Stock in proportion to the respective numbers of shares of Common Stock held. (Record date) March 31 is the record date for Sony Corporations year-end dividends, if declared. So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, shareholders who are registered as the holders of one or more unit of stock in Sony Corporations register of shareholders at the end of each March 31 are also entitled to exercise shareholders rights at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders with respect to the business year ending on such March 31. September 30 is the record date for interim dividends. In addition, Sony Corporation may set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to other rights and for other purposes by giving at least two weeks prior public notice. JASDEC is required to promptly give Sony Corporation notice of the names and addresses of Sony Corporations shareholders, the numbers of shares of Common Stock held by them and other relevant information as of such record date. (Acquisition by Sony Corporation of its capital stock) Under the Companies Act and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may acquire shares of Common Stock (i) from a specific shareholder other than any of its subsidiaries (pursuant to the special shareholders resolution), (ii) from any of its subsidiaries (pursuant to a determination by the CEO as 116 Table of Contents delegated by the Board of Directors), or (iii) by way of purchase on any Japanese stock exchange on which Sony Corporations shares of Common Stock are listed or by way of tender offer (pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, as long as its non-consolidated annual financial statements and certain documents for the last business year present fairly its assets and profit or loss, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice). In the case of (i) above, any other shareholder may make a request to Sony Corporation that such other shareholder be included as a seller in the proposed purchase, provided that no such right will be available if the purchase price or any other consideration to be received by the relevant specific shareholder will not exceed the last trading price of the shares on the relevant stock exchange on the day immediately preceding the date on which the resolution mentioned in (i) above was adopted (or, if there is no trading in the shares on the stock exchange or if the stock exchange is not open on such day, the price at which the shares are first traded on such stock exchange thereafter). The total amount of the purchase price of shares of Common Stock may not exceed the Distributable Amount, as described in (Distribution of Surplus)  Distributions of Surplus  Restriction on distributions of Surplus. Shares acquired by Sony Corporation may be held for any period or may be retired at the determination of the CEO. Sony Corporation may also transfer (by public or private sale or otherwise) to any person the shares held by it, subject to a determination by the CEO, and subject also to other requirements similar to those applicable to the issuance of new shares, as described in (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) above. Sony Corporation may also utilize its treasury stock for the purpose of transfer to any person upon exercise of stock acquisition rights or for the purpose of acquiring another company by way of merger, share exchange or corporate split through exchange of treasury stock for shares or assets of the acquired company. (Unit share system) The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that 100 shares constitute one unit of shares of stock. The Board of Directors or the Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such a determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors is permitted to amend the Articles of Incorporation to reduce the number of shares that constitute a unit or to abolish the unit share system entirely. The number of shares constituting one unit cannot exceed 1,000 shares. Under the unit share system, shareholders have one voting right for each unit of stock that they hold. Any number of shares less than one full unit have neither voting rights nor rights related to voting rights. Holders of shares constituting less than one unit will have no other shareholder rights if Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation so provide, except that such holders may not be deprived of certain rights specified in the Companies Act or an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice, including the right to receive distribution of Surplus. A holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may require Sony Corporation to purchase such Shares at their market value in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. In addition, the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that a holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may request Sony Corporation to sell to such holder such amount of shares which will, when added together with the shares constituting less than one full unit, constitute one full unit of stock. Such request by a holder and the sale by Sony Corporation must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. As prescribed in the Share Handling Regulations, such requests shall be made through an account management institution and JASDEC pursuant to the rules set by JASDEC, without going through the notification procedure required for the exercise of shareholders rights entitled regardless of record dates as described in General. Shares constituting less than a full unit are transferable, under the new book-entry transfer system described in General. Under the rules of the stock exchanges, however, shares constituting less than a full unit do not comprise a trading unit, except in limited circumstances, and accordingly may not be sold on the Japanese stock exchanges. 117 Table of Contents (Sale by Sony Corporation of shares held by shareholders whose location is unknown) Sony Corporation is not required to send a notice to a shareholder if a notice to such shareholder fails to arrive at the registered address of the shareholder in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation continuously for five years or more. In addition, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of shares of capital stock for which the location of the shareholder is unknown. Generally, if (i) notices to a shareholder fail to arrive continuously for five years or more at the shareholders registered address in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, and (ii) the shareholder fails to receive distributions of Surplus on the shares continuously for five years or more at the address registered in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholders shares at the then market price of the shares by a determination of a Corporate Executive Officer and after giving at least three months prior public and individual notice, and hold or deposit the proceeds of such sale or disposal of shares for such shareholder. Reporting of substantial shareholdings The Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan and its related regulations require any person, regardless of residence, who has become, beneficially and solely or jointly, a holder of more than five percent of the total issued shares of capital stock of a company listed on any Japanese stock exchange or whose shares are traded on the over-the-counter market in Japan to file with the Director General of the competent Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance within five business days a report concerning such shareholdings. A similar report must also be filed in respect of any subsequent change of one percent or more in any such holding, or any change in material matters set out in reports previously filed, with certain exceptions. For this purpose, shares issuable to such persons upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of share subscription warrants or stock acquisition rights are taken into account in determining both the number of shares held by such holders and the issuers total issued share capital. Any such report shall be filed with the Director General of the relevant Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance through the Electronic Disclosure for Investors Network (EDINET) system. Copies of such report must also be furnished to the issuer of such shares and all Japanese stock exchanges on which such shares are listed. Except for the general limitation under Japanese anti-trust and anti-monopoly regulations against holding of shares of capital stock of a Japanese corporation which leads or may lead to a restraint of trade or monopoly, and except for general limitations under the Companies Act or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation on the rights of shareholders applicable regardless of residence or nationality, there is no limitation under Japanese laws and regulations applicable to Sony Corporation or under its Articles of Incorporation on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. There is no provision in Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation or internal regulations that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Sony Corporation and that would operate only with respect to merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving Sony Corporation. Material Contracts None Exchange Controls The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act of Japan and its related cabinet orders and ministerial ordinances (the Foreign Exchange Regulations) govern the acquisition and holding of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation by exchange non-residents and by foreign investors. The Foreign Exchange Regulations currently in effect do not, however, affect transactions between exchange non-residents to purchase or sell shares outside Japan using currencies other than Japanese yen. 118 Table of Contents Exchange non-residents are:  individuals who do not reside in Japan; and  corporations whose principal offices are located outside Japan. Generally, branches and other offices of non-resident corporations that are located within Japan are regarded as residents of Japan. Conversely, branches and other offices of Japanese corporations located outside Japan are regarded as exchange non-residents. Foreign investors are:  individuals who are exchange non-residents;  corporations that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or whose principal offices are located outside of Japan; and  corporations (1) 50 percent or more of whose shares are held, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are exchange non-residents and/or corporations (a) that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or (b) whose principal offices are located outside of Japan or (2) a majority of whose officers, or officers having the power of representation, are individuals who are exchange non-residents. In general, the acquisition of shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) by an exchange non-resident from a resident of Japan is not subject to any prior filing requirements. In certain limited circumstances, however, the Minister of Finance may require prior approval of an acquisition of this type. While prior approval, as described above, is not required, in the case where a resident of Japan transfers shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) for consideration exceeding 100 million yen to an exchange non-resident, the resident of Japan who transfers the shares is required to report on the transfer to the Minister of Finance within 20 days from the date of the transfer, unless the transfer was made through a bank, securities company or financial futures trader licensed under Japanese law. If a foreign investor acquires shares of a Japanese company that is listed on a Japanese stock exchange (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) or that is traded on an over-the-counter market in Japan and, as a result of the acquisition, the foreign investor, in combination with any existing holdings, directly or indirectly holds 10 percent or more of the issued shares of the relevant company, the foreign investor must file a report of the acquisition with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers having jurisdiction over that Japanese company by the 15th day of the month immediately following the month in which such acquisition took place. In limited circumstances, such as where the foreign investor is in a country that is not listed on an exemption schedule in the Foreign Exchange Regulations, or where that Japanese company is engaged in certain businesses designated by the Foreign Exchange Regulations, a prior notification of the acquisition must be filed with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers, who may then modify or prohibit the proposed acquisition. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, dividends paid on and the proceeds from sales in Japan of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation held by non-residents of Japan may generally be converted into any foreign currency and repatriated abroad. Taxation The following is a summary of the major Japanese national tax and U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership, acquisition and disposition of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation and of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation by a non-resident of Japan or a non-Japanese corporation without a permanent establishment in Japan. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to any particular investor, and does not take into account any specific individual circumstances of any particular investor. Accordingly, holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the considerations discussed below to their particular circumstances. This summary is based upon the representations of the depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement in relation to the ADSs dated as of June 1, 1961, as amended and restated as of October 31, 119 Table of Contents 1991, as further amended and restated as of March 17, 1995, and as of February 25, 2010, and in any related agreement, will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of the income tax convention between Japan and the United States (the Treaty) and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), U.S. holders of ADSs generally will be treated as owning shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation underlying the ADSs evidenced by the ADRs. For the purposes of the following discussion, a U.S. holder is a holder that: (i) is a resident of the U.S. for purposes of the Treaty; (ii) does not maintain a permanent establishment in Japan (a) with which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are effectively connected and through which the U.S. holder carries on or has carried on business or (b) of which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation form part of the business property; and (iii) is eligible for benefits under the Treaty with respect to income and gain derived in connection with shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation. Japanese Taxation The following is a summary of the principal Japanese tax consequences (limited to national taxes) to non-residents of Japan or non-Japanese corporations without a permanent establishment in Japan (non-resident Holders) who are holders of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation or of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation. Generally, non-resident Holders are subject to Japanese withholding tax on dividends paid by Japanese corporations. Such taxes are withheld prior to payment of dividends as required by Japanese law. Stock splits are, in general, not a taxable event. In the absence of an applicable tax treaty, convention or agreement reducing the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax or allowing exemption from Japanese withholding tax, the rate of Japanese withholding tax applicable to dividends paid by Japanese corporations to non-resident Holders is generally 20 percent, provided, with respect to dividends paid on listed shares issued by a Japanese corporation (such as the shares of Common Stock or ADRs of Sony Corporation) to non-resident Holders other than any individual shareholder who holds 5 percent or more of the total shares issued by the relevant Japanese corporation, the aforementioned 20 percent withholding tax rate is reduced to (i) 7 percent for dividends due and payable on or before December 31, 2011, and (ii) 15 percent for dividends due and payable on or after January 1, 2012. As of the date of this document, Japan has income tax treaties, conventions or agreements whereby the above-mentioned withholding tax rate is reduced, in most cases to 15 percent or 10 percent for portfolio investors (15 percent under the income tax treaties with, among other countries, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, and 10 percent under the income tax treaties with Australia, France, the U.K. and the United States). Under the Treaty, the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax that may be imposed on dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that does not own directly or indirectly at least 10 percent of the voting stock of the Japanese corporation is generally reduced to 10 percent of the gross amount actually distributed, and dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that is a pension fund are exempt from Japanese income taxation by way of withholding or otherwise unless such dividends are derived from the carrying on of a business, directly or indirectly, by such pension fund. If the maximum tax rate provided for in the income tax treaty applicable to dividends paid by Sony Corporation to any particular non-resident Holder is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law, or if any particular non-resident Holder is exempt from Japanese income tax with respect to such dividends under the income tax treaty applicable to such particular non-resident Holder, such non-resident Holder who is entitled to a reduced rate of or exemption from Japanese withholding tax on payment of dividends on shares of common stock by Sony Corporation is required to submit an Application Form for Income Tax Convention Regarding Relief from Japanese Income Tax on Dividends (together with any other required forms and documents) 120 Table of Contents in advance through the withholding agent to the relevant tax authority before the payment of dividends. A standing proxy for non-resident Holders of a Japanese corporation may provide this application service. With respect to ADSs, this reduced rate or exemption is applicable if the depositary or its agent submits two Application Forms (one before payment of dividends and the other within eight months after the record date concerning such payment of dividends). To claim this reduced rate or exemption, a non-resident Holder of ADSs will be required to file a proof of taxpayer status, residence and beneficial ownership (as applicable) and to provide other information or documents as may be required by the depositary. A non-resident Holder who is entitled, under an applicable income tax treaty, to a reduced rate which is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law or an exemption from the withholding tax, but failed to submit the required application in advance will be entitled to claim the refund of taxes withheld in excess of the rate under an applicable tax treaty (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to a reduced treaty rate under the applicable income tax treaty) or the full amount of tax withheld (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to an exemption under the applicable income tax treaty) from the relevant Japanese tax authority, by complying with a certain subsequent filing procedure. Sony Corporation does not assume any responsibility to ensure withholding at the reduced treaty rate or to ensure not withholding for shareholders who would be so eligible under any applicable income tax treaty but where the required procedures as stated above are not followed. Gains derived from the sale of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation outside Japan by a non-resident Holder holding such shares or ADSs as portfolio investors are, in general, not subject to Japanese income tax or corporation tax. U.S. holders are not subject to Japanese income or corporation tax with respect to such gains under the Treaty. Japanese inheritance and gift taxes at progressive rates may be payable by an individual who has acquired shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation as a legatee, heir or donee even though neither the individual nor the deceased nor donor is a Japanese resident. Holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of these taxes and, in the case of U.S. holders, the possible application of the Estate and Gift Tax Treaty between the U.S. and Japan. United States Taxation with respect to shares of Common Stock and ADSs The U.S. dollar amount of dividends received (prior to deduction of Japanese taxes) by a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock will be included in income as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits of Sony Corporation as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by an individual prior to January 1, 2011 with respect to the ADSs or Common Stock will be subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent if the dividends are qualified dividends. Dividends paid on the Common Stock or ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if Sony Corporation was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). Based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, Sony Corporation believes that it was not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2009 taxable year. In addition, based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and Sony Corporations current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market and shareholder data, Sony Corporation does not anticipate becoming a PFIC for the 2010 taxable year. The U.S. Treasury has announced its intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which holders of ADSs or Common Stock and intermediaries through whom such securities are held will be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers to treat dividends as qualified for tax reporting purposes. Because such procedures have not yet been issued, it is not clear whether Sony Corporation will be able to comply with them. Holders of ADSs and Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of the considerations discussed above and their own particular circumstances. Subject to applicable limitations and special considerations discussed below, a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock of Sony Corporation will be entitled to a credit for Japanese tax withheld in accordance with the Treaty from dividends paid by Sony Corporation. For purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, dividends will be foreign source 121 Table of Contents income, and will generally constitute passive income. Foreign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term of hedged positions and may not be allowed in respect of arrangements in which economic profit, after non-U.S. taxes, is insubstantial. Holders of ADSs and Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of these rules in light of their particular circumstances. Dividends paid by Sony Corporation to U.S. corporate holders of ADSs or Common Stock will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. In general, a U.S. holder will recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Common Stock equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or disposition and the U.S. holders tax basis in the ADSs or Common Stock. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the ADSs or Common Stock have been held for more than one year on the date of the sale or disposition. The net amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder before January 1, 2011 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent. The net long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder after December 31, 2010 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20 percent. Under the Code, a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information reporting and possibly backup withholding with respect to dividends and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Common Stock, unless the U.S. holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or correct taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules is not additional tax and may be refunded or credited against the U.S. holders federal income tax liability, so long as the required information is furnished to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

You can also access the documents at the SECs home page (http://www.sec.gov/index.html). Subsidiary Information Not Applicable Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Sonys business is continuously exposed to market fluctuation, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates or stock prices. Sony utilizes several derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements in order to hedge the potential downside risk on the cash flow from the normal course of business caused by market fluctuation. Sony uses foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts primarily to reduce the foreign exchange volatility risk that accounts receivable or accounts payable denominated in yen, U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies have through the normal course of Sonys worldwide business. Interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements are utilized to diversify funding conditions or to reduce funding costs, and in the Financial Services segment, these transactions are used for asset liability management. Sony uses these derivative financial instruments mainly for risk-hedging purposes as described above, and few derivative transactions, such as bond futures and bond options are held or utilized for trading purposes in the Financial Services segment. If hedge accounting cannot be applied because the accounts receivable or accounts payable to be 122 Table of Contents hedged are not yet booked, or because cash flows from derivative transactions do not coincide with the underlying exposures recorded on Sonys balance sheet, such derivatives agreements are subject to a mark-to-market evaluation and their unrealized gains or losses are recognized in earnings. In addition, Sony holds marketable securities such as straight bonds, convertible bonds, and stocks in yen or other currencies in the Financial Services segment in order to obtain interest income or capital gain on the financial assets under management. Investments in marketable securities are also subject to market fluctuation. Sony measures the economic impact of market fluctuations on the value of derivatives agreements and marketable securities by using Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis in order to comply with Item 11 disclosure requirements. VaR in this context indicates the potential maximum amount of loss in fair value resulting from adverse market fluctuations for a selected period of time and at a selected level of confidence. The following table shows the results of VaR. These analyses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 indicate the potential maximum loss in fair value as predicted by the VaR analysis resulting from market fluctuations in one day at a 95 percent confidence level. The VaR of currency exchange rate risk principally consists of risks arising from the volatility of the exchange rates between the yen and U.S. dollar and between the yen and the euro, the currencies in which a significant amount of financial assets and liabilities and derivative transactions are maintained on a consolidated basis. The VaR of interest rate risk and stock price risk consists of risks arising from the volatility of the interest rates and stock prices against invested securities and derivatives transactions in the Financial Services segment. The net VaR for Sonys entire portfolio is smaller than the simple aggregate of VaR for each component of market risk. This is due to the fact that market risk factors such as currency exchange rates, interest rates, and stock prices are not completely independent, and potential profits and losses arising from each market risk may to some degree be mutually offsetting. The disclosed VaR amounts simply represent the calculated potential maximum loss on the specified date and does not necessarily indicate an estimate of actual or future loss.

Description of Securities Other Than Equity Securities Item 12(d). American Depositary Shares JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Depositary) serves as the depositary for Sonys ADSs. ADS holders are required to pay various fees to the Depositary and the Depositary may refuse to provide any service for which a fee is assessed until the applicable fee has been paid. ADS holders are required to pay the Depositary an annual fee of 0.05 U.S. dollar per ADS (or portion thereof) for administering the ADS program, and amounts in respect of expenses incurred by the Depositary or its agents on behalf of ADS holders, including expenses arising from (i) compliance with applicable law, taxes or other governmental charges, (ii) cable, telex or facsimile transmission, (iii) transfer or registration in connection with the deposit or withdrawal of deposited securities, and (iv) conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars. In each case, the fee may be charged on a periodic basis and the Depositary may decide in its sole discretion to seek payment by either billing holders or by deducting the fee from one or more cash dividends or other cash distributions. ADS holders are also required to pay additional fees for certain services provided by the Depositary, as set forth in the table below. Depositary service Fee payable by ADS holders Issuance and delivery of ADRs, including in connection with share distributions, sales and stock splits 5.00 U.S. dollars for each 100 ADSs (or portion thereof) Cash distribution of dividends 0.05 U.S. dollar or less per ADS Transfers of ADRs 1.50 U.S. dollars per ADS Distribution or sale of securities other than ADRs 5.00 U.S. dollars for each 100 shares Withdrawal, cancellation or reduction of shares underlying ADSs 5.00 U.S. dollars per 100 ADSs (or portion thereof) Direct and Indirect Payments by the Depositary to Sony The Depositary reimburses Sony for certain expenses Sony incurs in connection with its ADR program, subject to a ceiling agreed upon by Sony and the Depositary from time to time. These reimbursable expenses currently include legal and accounting fees, listing fees, investor relations expenses and fees payable to service providers for the distribution of material to ADR holders. For the year ended March 31, 2010, such reimbursements totaled approximately 1.4 million U.S. dollars. In addition, as part of its service to Sony, the Depositary waives fees for the standard costs associated with the administration of the ADR program, associated operating expenses, investor relations advice and access to an internet-based tool used in Sonys investor relations activities. For the year ended March 31, 2010, the amount of these indirect payments was estimated to total 0.2 million U.S. dollars. Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies None Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds None Item 15. Controls and Procedures Item 15(a). Disclosure Controls and Procedures Sony has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Sonys management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Sonys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) 124 Table of Contents under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of March 31, 2010. Disclosure controls and procedures require that information to be disclosed in the reports Sony files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Sonys management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon Sonys evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of March 31, 2010, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Item 15(b). Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Sonys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Sonys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles. Sonys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Sony; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Sony are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Sonys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Sonys management evaluated the effectiveness of Sonys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2010 based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the evaluation, management has concluded that Sony maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2010. Sonys independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2010, presented on page (F-2). Item 15(c). Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Refer to the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page (F-2). Item 15(d). Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in Sonys internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Sonys internal control over financial reporting. 125 Table of Contents Item 16. [Reserved] Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert Sonys Board of Directors has determined that Yoshiaki Yamauchi and Kanemitsu Anraku each qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, both are determined to be independent as defined under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Corporate Governance Standards. Item 16B. Code of Ethics Sony has adopted a code of ethics, as defined in Item 16B of Form 20-F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The code of ethics applies to Sonys Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, chief accounting officer and persons performing similar functions, as well as to directors and all other officers and employees of Sony, as defined in the code of ethics. The code of ethics is available at http://www.sony.net/code Item 16C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services Audit and Non-Audit Fees The following table presents fees for audit and other services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2010. Fiscal Year ended March 31 2009 2010 Yen in millions Audit Fees(1) 4,457 4,175 Audit-Related Fees(2) 323 152 Tax Fees(3) 27 1 All Other Fees(4) 26 74 4,833 4,402 (1) Audit Fees consist of fees billed for the annual audit services engagement and other audit services, which are those services that only the external auditor can provide. (2) Audit-Related Fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services, and primarily include advisory services relating to the implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards, audit services relating to benefit plans, and audit services relating to business acquisitions and dispositions. (3) Tax Fees primarily consist of fees for tax advice. (4) All Other Fees comprise fees for all other services not included in any of the other categories noted above. Audit Committees Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures Consistent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules regarding auditor independence, Sonys Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, reviewing and setting compensation, retaining, and overseeing the work of Sonys independent auditor, so that the auditors independence will not be impaired, including overseeing any separate firm that audits the financial statements of any subsidiary if Sonys independent auditor expressly relies on the audit report of such firm. The Audit Committee established a formal policy requiring pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor to Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. The Audit Committee shall periodically review this policy with due regard for compliance with laws and regulations of host countries where Sony Corporation is listed. Prior to the engagement of the independent auditor for the following fiscal years audit, management shall submit an application form to the Audit Committee for comprehensive pre-approval of all recurring services expected to be rendered during that year. In order to obtain comprehensive pre-approval, management shall provide 126 Table of Contents sufficient information regarding each service so that each service can be classified into one of four categories (Audit, Audit-Related, Tax, or All Other) as well as information regarding the fees expected to be budgeted for each service. Management shall describe each service in detail and indicate precisely and unambiguously the nature and scope of each particular service. Any additional services not contemplated in the application form shall require the Audit Committees separate pre-approval on an individual basis. The Audit Committee will approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees, resulting from changes in the scope of services to be provided or from other circumstances. The Audit Committee Chair retains pre-approval authority and evaluates items for approval on a request basis. The Audit Committee or its designee shall establish procedures to assure that the independent auditor is aware in a timely manner of the services that have been pre-approved. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, the Audit Committee continued, as a matter of Sonys policy, to generally exclude individual tax services and corporate tax services from the list of permissible services to enhance auditor independence. The Audit Committee carefully reviewed these services and only permitted exceptional instances, which were not prohibited under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These exceptions were only allowed in situations in which difficulties were encountered in finding an alternative service provider immediately, or when a transitional period was needed. Item 16D.

Change in Registrants Certifying Accountant Not Applicable. Item 16G. Disclosure About Differences in Corporate Governance The table below discloses the significant ways in which Sonys corporate governance practices differ from those required for U.S. companies under the listing standards of the NYSE. As a foreign private issuer listed on the NYSE, Sony is exempt from most of the exchanges corporate governance standards requirements. For further information on Sonys corporate governance practices and history, please refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Director, Senior Management and Employees. NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices Board Independence. A majority of board directors must be independent. Sony has adopted the Company with Committees system under the Companies Act of Japan and its related regulations (collectively the Companies Act). Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors (attached as an exhibit 1.3 to this report) requires its board to consist of between 10 to 20 directors. The Companies Act does not require Sony to have a majority of independent (in the meaning given by the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards) directors on its board; rather, it requires Sony to have a majority of outside directors (the definition of the term outside director is summarized below) on each of three statutory committees (the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee). In addition, the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange require Sony to have, at least one Independent Director on the Board of Directors. Independent Director is defined in the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange as an outside director who is unlikely to have conflicts of interest with shareholders. As of June 28, 2010, 12 of the 14 members of Sonys Board of Directors are qualified as outside directors. In addition, all 12 outside directors are also qualified and designated as Independent Directors under the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Director Independence. A director is not independent if such director is (i) a person who the board determines has a material direct or indirect relationship with the company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary; (ii) a person who, within the last three years, has been an employee of the company or has an immediate family member of an executive officer of the company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary; (iii) a person who had received, or whose immediate family member had received, during any 12 month Outside director is defined in the Companies Act as: A director (i) who is not a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or a general manager or other employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) who has never been a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or a general manager or other 128 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices period within the last three years, more than 120,000 U.S dollars per year in direct compensation from the company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary, other than director and committee fees or deferred compensation for prior services (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service); (iv) (A) a person who is, or whose immediate family member is, a current partner or employee of a firm that is the companys internal or external auditor; (B) a person whose immediate family member is a partner of such a firm; (C) a person who has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and who personally participates in the firms audit, assurance or tax compliance (but not tax planning) practice; or (D) a person who was, or has an immediate family member who was, within the last three years, a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on the listed companys audit within that time; (v) a person who is, or whose immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the listed companys present executive officers at the same time serves or served on that companys compensation committee; or (vi) an executive officer or employee of a company, or has an immediate family member of an executive officer of a company, that makes payments to, or receives payments from, the listed company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of 1 million U.S. dollars or 2 percent of such other companys consolidated gross revenues. employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries. Under the Companies Act, a directors status as an outside director is unaffected by the directors compensation, his or her affiliation with business partners, or the boards affirmative determination of independence. On the other hand, under the Companies Act, a director who has had a career as a management director, corporate executive officer, or other employee of the company or its subsidiaries is by definition not an outside director. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors includes a provision requiring that each outside director: (i) Shall not have received directly from Sony Group, during any consecutive 12 month period within the last three years, more than an amount equivalent to 120,000 U.S dollars, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service); (ii) Shall not be a director, a statutory auditor, a corporate executive officer, a general manager or other employees of any company whose aggregate amount of transactions with Sony Group, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of an amount equivalent to 1,000,000 U.S. dollars, or 2 percent of the annual consolidated sales of such company; and (iii) Shall not be, or shall not have been, a director engaged in the business operation, a corporate executive officer, an accounting counselor, a general manager or other employees of Sony or its subsidiaries*. (* This provision of the Charter is based on the definition of outside director under the Companies Act.) In addition, the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange requires Sony to have, at least one Independent Director on the Board of Directors. Independent Director is defined in the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange as an officer who is unlikely to have conflicts of interest with shareholders. As of June 28, 2010, 12 of the 14 members of Sonys Board of Directors qualified as outside directors. In addition, all those 12 outside directors are qualified and designated as Independent Directors under the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 129 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices Executive Sessions. Non-management directors must meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. Independent directors should meet alone in an executive session at least once a year. An outside director, as defined under the Companies Act, is equivalent to a non-management director under the NYSE rules because an outside director does not engage in the execution of business operations of the company. Neither the Companies Act nor Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors requires non-management directors to meet regularly without management and nothing requires outside directors to meet alone in an executive session at least once a year. Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. A nominating/corporate governance committee of independent directors is required. The committee must have a charter that addresses the purpose, responsibilities (including development of corporate governance guidelines) and annual performance evaluation of the committee. Sonys Nominating Committee consists of at least five directors. Under the Companies Act, the Committee is responsible for determining the contents of proposals regarding the appointment and dismissal of directors to be submitted for approval to the shareholders meeting. Unlike listed U.S. companies under NYSE rules, it is not responsible for developing governance guidelines or overseeing the evaluation of the board and management. Under the Companies Act, a majority of its members must be outside directors, as defined under the Companies Act. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors requires at least two of the directors on the Committee to be corporate executive officers. Compensation Committee. A compensation committee of independent directors is required. The committee must have a charter that addresses the purpose, responsibilities and annual performance evaluation of the committee. Sonys Compensation Committee consists of at least three directors. Under the Companies Act, a majority of its members must be outside directors, as defined under the Companies Act. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors recommends that at least one of the directors on the Committee be a corporate executive officer. The Charter prohibits the CEO and/or the COO (or a person at any equivalent position) from serving on the Compensation Committee. Under the Companies Act, the Committee is responsible for, among others, determining the compensation of each director and corporate executive officer. Audit Committee. An audit committee satisfying the independence and other requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. The committee must have at least three members. All members must be independent. The committee must have a charter addressing the committees purpose, an annual performance evaluation of the committee and the duties and responsibilities of the committee. Sonys Audit Committee consists of at least three directors. Under the Companies Act, a majority of its members must be outside directors, as defined under the Companies Act. In addition, pursuant to the Companies Act, no member of the Committee shall be a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries who is engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or an accounting counselor, general manager or other employee of any of such subsidiaries. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors also requires each member of the Audit Committee to meet the 130 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices independence requirements of the applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations, and requires at least one member to meet the audit committee financial expert requirements. Currently, all the members of Sonys Audit Committee are also independent as defined in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards, and two members of the Committee are qualified as audit committee financial experts. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors discourages any Audit Committee member from concurrently being a member of other Committees. Equity Compensation Plans. Equity compensation plans require shareholder approval, subject to limited exemptions. Under the Companies Act, if Sony wishes to adopt an equity compensation plan under which stock acquisition rights are granted on specially favorable conditions, except where all of its shareholders are granted rights to subscribe for such stock acquisition rights or such stock acquisition rights are gratuitously allocated to all of its shareholders, each on a pro rata basis, then Sony must obtain shareholder approval by a special resolution of a general meeting of shareholders, where the quorum is one-third of the total number of voting rights of all of its shareholders and the approval by at least two-thirds of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting is required under Sonys Articles of Incorporation. Corporate Governance Guidelines. Corporate governance guidelines must be adopted and disclosed. Sony is required to disclose the status of its corporate governance under the Companies Act and the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange; however, Sony does not have corporate governance guidelines that cover all the requirements described in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards, as many of the provisions do not apply to Sony. Details of the status are posted on the following website: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/control.html Code of Ethics. A code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees must be adopted and disclosed, along with any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers. Although this provision of the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards does not apply to Sony, Sony has adopted a code of conduct to be observed by all its directors, officers and other employees. The code of conduct is available at http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr/management/ compliance/code_of_conduct.pdf The codes content covers principal items described in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards. 131 Table of Contents Item 17.
