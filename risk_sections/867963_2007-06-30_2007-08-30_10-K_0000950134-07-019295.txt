ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K annual report are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this report. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such event, the trading price of our common stock could decline. In the following portion of this Item 1A, the words "we," "us" and "our" sometimes specifically mean and refer to our subsidiary UAHC-TN, when the context so indicates. Such factors potentially include, among others, the following: REDUCTIONS IN FUNDING FOR GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS COULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY. Substantially all of the healthcare services we offer are through government-sponsored programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare. As a result, our profitability is dependent, in large part, on continued funding for government healthcare programs at or above current levels. Future Medicaid premium rate levels may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs or state and federal budgetary constraints. Changes in Medicaid funding, for example, may lead to reductions in the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for Medicaid, reductions in the amount of reimbursement or elimination of coverage for certain benefits. Reductions in Medicaid payments could reduce our profitability if we are unable to reduce our related expenses. Reductions in payments under Medicare or the other programs under which we offer health and prescription drug plans could similarly reduce our profitability. CMS'S RISK ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BUDGET NEUTRALITY FACTORS MAKE OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for Medicare health plans to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for Medicare plans to enroll and treat less healthy Medicare beneficiaries. CMS is phasing in this payment methodology with a risk adjustment model that bases a portion of the total CMS reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors that include: hospital inpatient diagnoses; diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings, including hospital outpatient facilities and physician visits; gender; age; and Medicaid eligibility. CMS requires that all managed care companies capture, collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS twice a year for reconciliation with CMS's internal database. As a result, it is difficult to predict with any certainty our future revenue or profitability. In addition, our SNP risk scores for any period may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the payments we receive from CMS and our Medicare premium revenue. 11 Payments to Medicare Advantage plans are also adjusted by a "budget neutrality" factor that Congress and CMS implemented in 2003 to prevent overall reductions in health plan payments while at the same time directing risk-adjusted payments to plans with more chronically ill enrollees. In general, this adjustment favorably impacted payments to Medicare Advantage plans. In February 2006, the President signed legislation that reduced federal funding for Medicare Advantage plans by approximately $6.5 billion over five years. Among other changes, the legislation provided for an accelerated phase-out of budget neutrality for risk-adjusted payments made to Medicare Advantage plans. These legislative changes will in general result in reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED MEDICAL BENEFITS EXPENSE ACCURATELY, THAT COULD AFFECT OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. Our medical benefits expense includes estimates of medical claims incurred but not reported ("IBNR"). Together with our internal and consulting actuaries, we estimate our medical cost liabilities using actuarial methods based on historical data adjusted for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors. Actual conditions could, however, differ from those assumed in the estimation process. We continually review and update our estimation methods and the resulting reserves and make adjustments, if necessary, to medical benefits expense when the criteria used to determine IBNR change and when actual claim costs are ultimately determined. Due to the uncertainties associated with the factors used in these assumptions, the actual amount of medical benefits expense that we incur may be materially more than the amount of IBNR originally estimated. If our future estimates of IBNR are inadequate, our reported results of operations could be negatively impacted. Our limited ability to estimate IBNR accurately could also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions, exacerbating the extent of any adverse effect on our results. OUR RECORDS MAY CONTAIN INACCURATE INFORMATION REGARDING THE RISK ADJUSTMENT SCORES OF OUR MEMBERS, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO OVERSTATE OR UNDERSTATE OUR REVENUE. We maintain claims and encounter data that support the risk adjustment scores of our members, which partly determine the revenue we are entitled to for them. These data are submitted to us based on medical charts and diagnosis codes prepared by providers of medical care. Inaccurate coding by medical providers and inaccurate records for new members in our plan could result in inaccurate premium revenue and risk adjustment payments, which are subject to correction or update in later periods. Payments that we receive in connection with such corrected or updated information may be reflected in financial statements for periods subsequent to the period in which the revenue was earned. We may also find that our data regarding our members' risk adjustment scores, when reconciled, requires that we refund a portion of the revenue that we received. THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. Payments for local and regional Medicare Advantage plans are based on a competitive bidding process that may decrease the amount of premiums paid to us or cause us to increase the benefits we offer without a corresponding increase in premiums. As a result of the competitive bidding 12 process, in order to maintain our current level of profitability, in the future we may need to reduce benefits or charge our members an additional premium, either of which could make our health plan less attractive to members and adversely affect our membership. WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM OUR TENNCARE OPERATIONS, AND LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHER FACTORS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THOSE OPERATIONS COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS. For the year ended June 30, 2007, our TennCare operations accounted for 93.9% of our total revenues. If we are unable to continue to operate in Tennessee or if our current operations in any portion of Tennessee are significantly curtailed, our revenues will decrease materially. Our substantial reliance on TennCare operations in Tennessee could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly, depending on legislative or regulatory actions, economic conditions and similar factors. WE DERIVE ALL OF OUR MEDICARE REVENUES FROM OUR SNP OPERATIONS, AND LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHER FACTORS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THOSE OPERATIONS COULD MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS. Because special needs plans (each a "SNP") are relatively new to Medicare and to the health insurance market generally, we do not know whether we will be able to sustain our SNP operation's profitability over the long-term, and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Factors that could effect our SNP operations include legislative, regulatory, intensity of competition, and utilization of benefit risks. In addition, Medicare beneficiaries who are dual-eligibles generally are able to disenroll and choose another SNP at any time, and certain Medicare beneficiaries also have a limited ability to disenroll from the SNP they initially select and choose a different SNP. We may not be able to retain the auto-assigned members or those members who affirmatively choose our SNP, and we may not be able to attract new SNP members. FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING FOR THE MEDICARE PART D BENEFITS IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES DIFFICULT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("MMA") provides for "risk corridors" designed to limit to some extent the losses SNPs would incur if their actual costs are higher than estimated in their bids submitted to CMS. For example, for 2007 drug plans bear all gains and losses up to 2.5% of their expected costs, but are reimbursed for 75% of the losses between 2.5% and 5%, and 80% of the losses in excess of 5%. The initial risk corridors in 2007 will not be available in 2008 or later years. As the risk corridors are designed to be symmetrical, a plan whose actual costs are below its expected costs is required to reimburse CMS based on a methodology similar to that set forth above. Reconciliation payments for estimated upfront federal reinsurance payments, or in some cases the entire amount of reinsurance payments, for Medicare beneficiaries who reach the drug benefits catastrophic threshold are made retroactively on an annual basis, which could expose plans to upfront costs in providing the benefit. 13 The accounting and regulatory guidance regarding the proper method of accounting for Medicare Part D, particularly as it relates to the timing of revenue and expense recognition, taken together with the complexity of the Part D product may lead to variability in our reporting of quarter-to-quarter earnings related to Medicare Part D. IF STATE REGULATORS DO NOT APPROVE PAYMENTS BY OUR HEALTH PLAN TO US, OUR BUSINESS AND GROWTH STRATEGY COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPAIRED OR WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO INCUR INDEBTEDNESS TO FUND THESE STRATEGIES. Our health plan subsidiary, UAHC-TN, is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions it can pay to us for purposes other than to pay income taxes related to its earnings. These laws and regulations also limit the amount of management fees UAHC-TN may pay to its affiliates, including our management subsidiary, United American of Tennessee, Inc., without prior approval of, or notification to, state regulators. If the regulators were to deny or significantly restrict our subsidiary's requests to pay dividends to us or to pay management and other fees to its affiliate, however, the funds available to us would be limited, which could impair our ability to implement our business and growth strategy. Alternatively, we could be required to incur indebtedness to fund these strategies. WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH LAWS GOVERNING THE TRANSMISSION, SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF HEALTH INFORMATION THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE COSTS, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES. Regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly called HIPAA, require us to comply with standards regarding the exchange of health information within our Company and with third parties, including healthcare providers, business associates and our members. These regulations include standards for common healthcare transactions, including claims information, plan eligibility and payment information; unique identifiers for providers and employers; security; privacy; and enforcement. We conduct our operations in an attempt to comply with all applicable HIPAA requirements. Given the complexity of the HIPAA regulations, the possibility that the regulations may change and the fact that the regulations are subject to changing and sometimes conflicting interpretation, our ongoing ability to comply with the HIPAA requirements is uncertain. Additionally, the costs of complying with any changes to the HIPAA regulations may have a negative impact on our operations. Sanctions for failing to comply with the HIPAA health information provisions include criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including significant monetary penalties. A failure by us to comply with state health information laws that may be more restrictive than the HIPAA regulations could result in additional penalties. IF OUR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE CONTRACTS ARE NOT EXTENDED OR ARE TERMINATED, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIRED. We provide services to our Medicaid and Medicare eligible members through two contracts, UAHC-TN's TennCare contract and its Medicare Advantage contract with CMS. These contracts' current terms expire December 31, 2007. UAHC-TN expects to receive notice of the extension of the terms of both contracts from the respective government agencies before that 14 date. Each contract is terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations. If either of these contracts were terminated or not extended, or if we were unable to successfully rebid or compete for either of these contracts, our business would be materially impaired. BECAUSE OUR PREMIUMS ARE ESTABLISHED BY CONTRACT AND CANNOT BE MODIFIED DURING THE CONTRACT TERM, OUR PROFITABILITY WILL LIKELY BE REDUCED OR WE COULD CEASE TO BE PROFITABLE IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE OUR MEDICAL EXPENSES EFFECTIVELY. Our SNP revenue is generated by premiums consisting of monthly payments per member that are established by the contract with CMS for our Medicare Advantage plan. If our medical expenses exceed our estimates, except in very limited circumstances or as a result of risk score adjustments for Medicare member health acuity, we will be unable to increase the premiums we receive under the contract during its then-current term. As a result, our profitability depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to adequately predict and effectively manage our medical expenses related to the provision of healthcare services. Relatively small changes in our medical loss ratio can create significant changes in our financial results. Accordingly, failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses or to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. COMPETITION IN OUR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE SERVICE AREA MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR ATTRACT MEMBERS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We operate in a competitive environment subject to significant changes as a result of business consolidations, evolving Medicare products, new strategic alliances and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations that compete with us for members. Our principal competitors for contracts, members and providers in our local service area include national, regional and local managed care organizations that serve Medicare. Many managed care companies and other new Part D plan participants have greater financial and other resources, larger enrollments, broader ranges of products and benefits, broader geographical coverage, more established reputations in the national market and our market, greater market share, larger contracting scale and lower costs than us. Our failure to maintain or attract members to our Medicare Advantage health plan as a result of such competition could adversely affect our results of operations. A FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR TENNCARE MEMBERS OR INCREASE OUR SNP MEMBERSHIP COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. A reduction in the number of members in our TennCare plan, or a failure to increase our SNP membership, could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition to competition, factors that potentially could contribute to the loss of, or failure to attract and retain, members include: - negative accreditation results or loss of licenses or contracts to offer Medicaid and Medicare Advantage plans; - negative publicity and news coverage relating to us or the managed healthcare industry generally; 15 - litigation or threats of litigation against us; - automatic disenrollment, whether intentional or inadvertent, as a result of members choosing another plan; and - our inability to market to and re-enroll members who enroll with our competitors because of the new annual enrollment and lock-in provisions under the MMA. A DISRUPTION IN OUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER NETWORKS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY. Our operations and profitability are dependent in part on our ability to contract with healthcare providers and provider networks on favorable terms. In any particular service area, healthcare providers or provider networks might refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs, disruption of benefits to our members or difficulty in meeting our regulatory or accreditation requirements. If healthcare providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, then our ability to market products or to be profitable in our service area could be adversely affected. Our provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large provider group. Any disruption in our provider network could result in a loss of membership or higher healthcare costs. WE RELY ON THE ACCURACY OF LISTS PROVIDED BY CMS REGARDING THE ELIGIBILITY OF A PERSON TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR PLAN, AND ANY INACCURACIES IN THOSE LISTS COULD CAUSE CMS TO RECOUP PREMIUM PAYMENTS FROM US WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT OURS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY. Premium payments that we receive from CMS are based upon eligibility lists produced by federal and local governments. From time to time, CMS may require us to reimburse it for any premiums that we received from CMS based on eligibility and dual-eligibility lists that CMS later discovers contained individuals who were not in fact residing in our service area or eligible for any government-sponsored program or were eligible for a different premium category or a different program. We may have already provided services to these individuals. In addition to CMS's potential recoupment of premiums previously paid, we also are at risk that CMS might fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment. Our profitability would be reduced as a result of such failure to receive payment from CMS if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from them. OUTSOURCED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY MAKE MISTAKES AND SUBJECT US TO FINANCIAL LOSS OR LEGAL LIABILITY. We outsource certain of the functions associated with providing managed care and management services, including claims processing. The service providers to whom we outsource these functions and provide data could inadvertently or incorrectly adjust, revise, omit or transmit the data in a manner that could create inaccuracies in our risk adjustment information, cause us to 16 overstate or understate our revenue, cause us to authorize incorrect payment levels to members of our provider networks, or violate certain laws and regulations, such as HIPAA. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY REGARDING THE MANAGED HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR THE COMPANY IN PARTICULAR COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR BUSINESS. Negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally or the Company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices that further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by: - requiring us to change our products and services; - increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate; - adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services; or - adversely affecting our ability to attract and retain members. WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM AND THEIR MANAGED CARE EXPERTISE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Our operations are highly dependent on the efforts of William C. Brooks, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other senior executives who have been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships. The Company neither has nor intends to pursue any long-term employment agreement with any of its key personnel. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain such relationships or attract such professionals. Although we believe we could replace any executive we lose, the loss of the leadership, knowledge and experience of Mr. Brooks and our other executive officers could adversely affect our business. Moreover, replacing one or more of our executives may be difficult or may require an extended period of time. We do not currently maintain key man insurance on any of our executive officers. VIOLATION OF THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO US COULD EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY, REDUCE OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS. The federal and state agencies administering the laws and regulations applicable to us have broad discretion to enforce them. We are subject on an ongoing basis to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with our contracts, licenses and applicable laws and regulations. An adverse review, audit or investigation could result in any of the following: - loss of our right to participate in the Medicare program; - loss of our license to act as an HMO or to otherwise provide a service; - forfeiture or recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts; 17 - imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, fines or other sanctions on us and our key employees; - damage to our reputation in existing and potential markets; - increased restrictions on marketing our products and services; and - inability to obtain approval for future products and services, geographic expansions or acquisitions. CLAIMS RELATING TO MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND OTHER LITIGATION COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES. From time to time, we are party to various litigation matters, some of which seek monetary damages. Managed care organizations may be sued directly for alleged negligence, including in connection with the credentialing of network providers or for alleged improper denials or delay of care. In addition, our providers involved in medical care decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims. Although our network providers are independent contractors, claimants sometimes allege that a managed care organization should be held responsible for alleged provider malpractice, and some courts have permitted that theory of liability. Similar to other managed care companies, we may also be subject to other claims of our members in the ordinary course of business, including claims of improper marketing practices by our independent and employee sales agents and claims arising out of decisions to deny or restrict reimbursement for services. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any pending litigation or potential future litigation, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur substantial expense in defending future lawsuits or indemnifying third parties with respect to the results of such litigation. The loss of even one of these claims, if it results in a significant damage award, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our exposure to potential liability under punitive damage or other theories could significantly decrease our ability to settle these claims on reasonable terms. We maintain errors and omissions insurance and other insurance coverage that we believe are adequate based on industry standards. Potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, our insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage and related reserves may be inadequate. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future, or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost-effective basis, if at all. Moreover, even if claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit, we would have to defend ourselves against such claims. The defense of any such actions may be time-consuming and costly and may distract our management's attention. As a result, we might incur significant expenses and might be unable to effectively operate our business. 18 IF WE ARE UNABLE OR FAIL TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE AND SECURE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, SUCCESSFULLY UPDATE OR EXPAND PROCESSING CAPABILITY OR DEVELOP NEW CAPABILITIES TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS, THAT COULD RESULT IN OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. Our business depends significantly on effective and secure information systems. The information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in, among other things, marketing and sales tracking, billing, claims processing, medical management, medical care cost and utilization trending, financial and management accounting, reporting, planning and analysis. These information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and handle our expansion and growth. Any inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems or related disaster recovery programs, successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner could result in operational disruptions, loss of existing members, difficulty in attracting new members or in implementing our growth strategies, disputes with members and providers, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses, loss of our ability to produce timely and accurate reports, and other adverse consequences. To the extent a failure in maintaining effective information systems occurs, we may need to contract for these services with third-party management companies, which could be on less favorable terms to us and could significantly disrupt our operations and information flow. Furthermore, our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation and possible liability and loss. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability could be adversely affected by cancellation of contracts, loss of members and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INVESTORS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Because of our status as a public company, we are required to enhance and test our financial, internal and management control systems to meet obligations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We have worked and are working with our independent legal, accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, internal audit, disclosure controls and procedures, and financial reporting and accounting systems. Consistent with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC, management's assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and the audit opinion of the Company's independent registered accounting firm as to the effectiveness of our controls will be first required in connection with the Company's filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009. If we are unable to timely identify, implement and conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent auditors are unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, 19 investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may also uncover weaknesses or other issues with these controls that could also result in adverse investor reaction. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
