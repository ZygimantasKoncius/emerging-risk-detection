Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties. We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. The following risk factors are not the only risk factors facing our Company. Additional risks that we do not consider material, or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on us. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs or materializes. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our stock price is subject to fluctuations and the value of your investment may decline. The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to:  our operating performance and the performance of our competitors, and in particular any variations in our operating results or dividend rate from our stated guidance or from investors expectations;  changes in general conditions in the economy, the industries in which we operate or the financial markets;  investors reaction to our press releases, public announcements, or filings with the SEC;  the stock price performance of competitors or other comparable companies;  changes in research analysts coverage, recommendations or earnings estimates for us or for the stocks of other companies in our industry;  sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and our other large shareholders, particularly in light of the limited trading volume of our stock;  any merger and acquisition activity that involves us or our competitors; and  other announcements or developments affecting us, our industry, customers, suppliers, or competitors. In addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and are based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price. Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to:  general economic conditions in the states and countries where we rent and sell our products;  legislative and educational policies where we rent and sell our products;  seasonality of our rental businesses and our end-markets;  success of our strategic growth initiatives;  the timing and type of equipment purchases, rentals and sales;  the nature and duration of the equipment needs of our customers;  the timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors;  the volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment;  our equipment mix, availability, utilization, and pricing; 13  the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets;  rental equipment impairment from excess, obsolete, or damaged equipment;  movements in interest rates or tax rates;  changes in, and application of, accounting rules;  changes in the regulations applicable to us; and  litigation matters. As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results. Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key employees is critical to the success of our business. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer. We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel, and in particular, Dennis Kakures our Chief Executive Officer. Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs. Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel when turnover occurs. Failure by third parties to manufacture our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition. We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products. Currently, we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with these third parties on acceptable terms, if at all. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with these third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed. Disruptions in our information technology systems could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption in any of our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner. During June 2005, we entered into an agreement with Rental Result, a rental software application provider, to support the transition of our modular business, certain aspects of our electronic test equipment business and our accounting systems to their platform. This is a multi-year project and we expect the first phase of the project to be completed in mid 2008. The new ERP and upgrades to our IT infrastructure will result in higher selling and administrative costs in 2007 and beyond. These information system upgrades are important to serve and support our strategic growth. The delay or failure to implement these new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract managements focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results. 14 We may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. In 2004, we acquired TRS, an electronic test equipment rental business. We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:  difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;  diversion of managements attention from normal daily operations of the business;  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;  timely completion of necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements;  an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;  undiscovered and unknown problems, defects or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition;  negative reactions from our customers to an acquisition;  disruptions among employees which may erode employee morale;  potential loss of key employees, including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees. In connection with acquisitions we may:  assume liabilities or acquire damaged assets, some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisitions;  record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; or  become subject to litigation. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders ownership could be diluted significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available credit line, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable, or recover our rental equipment from our customers sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We generally sell to customers on 30-day terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers on each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and related equipment not returned by customers has not been significant and, in each of the last five years has been less than 1% of total revenues. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in the write-off of customer receivables and loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment. If we are not able to manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit and equipment losses would increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 15 Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business. Our modular and electronics rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers selling prices. For both our modular and electronic test equipment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. The nature of our businesses exposes us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws. Certain aspects of our businesses involve risks of liability. In general, litigation in our industry, including class actions that seek substantial damages, arises with increasing frequency. Claims may be asserted under environmental, labor, health and safety or product liability laws. Litigation is invariably expensive, regardless of the merit of the plaintiffs claims. We may be named as a defendant in the future, and there can be no assurance, irrespective of the merit of such future actions, that we will not be required to make substantial settlement payments in the future. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than companies with a less significant California presence. Conducting our routine businesses exposes us to risk of litigation from employees, vendors and other third parties. We are subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of business; these risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by California law. If our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits. Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict or prohibit our ability to enter into a variety of transactions and may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. The agreements governing our 5.08% senior notes due in 2011 and our unsecured revolving line of credit facility contain various covenants that may limit our discretion in operating our business. In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate, reorganize or transfer substantially all of our assets, and create liens on our assets to secure debt. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the agreements could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. In the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make the required accelerated payments. If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected. The majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates. Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate increases because the majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates. At present, we do not have any derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or hedges to mitigate interest rate variability. The interest rates under our credit facilities will be reset at varying periods. These interest rate adjustments could expose our operating results and cash flows to periodic fluctuations. Our annual debt service obligations will increase by approximately $1.5 million per 16 year for each 1% increase in the average interest rate we pay, based on the $149.7 million balance of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007. If interest rates rise in the future, and particularly, if they rise significantly, our income will be negatively affected. Our effective tax rate may change and become less predictable as our business expands. We continue to consider expansion opportunities domestically and internationally for our rental businesses, such as our organic expansion of our modular business in Florida, North Carolina and Georgia and expansion through acquisition of TRS. Since the Companys effective tax rate depends on business levels, personnel and assets located in various jurisdictions, further expansion into new markets or acquisitions may change the effective tax rate in the future and may make it and consequently our earnings less predictable going forward. In addition, the enactment of tax law changes by federal and state taxing authorities may impact the Companys current period tax provision and its deferred tax liabilities. Changes in financial accounting standards may cause lower than expected operating results and affect our reported results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and their application may have a significant effect on our reported results on a going forward basis and may also affect the recording and disclosure of previously reported transactions. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Failure to comply with internal control attestation requirements could lead to loss of public confidence in our financial statements and negatively impact our stock price. As a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including Section 404, and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including expanded disclosures and accelerated reporting requirements. Compliance with Section 404 and other requirements has and will continue to increase our costs and require additional management resources. We may need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy new reporting requirements. While we completed a favorable assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, there is no assurance that future assessments of the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting will be favorable. If we are unable to obtain future unqualified reports as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal controls over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our stock price. If we suffer loss to our facilities, equipment or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. Our facilities, rental equipment and distribution systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, we have our headquarters, three operating facilities, and rental equipment in California, which are located in areas with above average seismic activity and could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake. Our rental equipment and facilities in Florida are located in areas subject to hurricanes and other tropical storms. In addition to customers insurance on rented equipment, we carry property insurance on our rental equipment in inventory and operating facilities as well as business interruption insurance. We believe our insurance policies are adequate with the appropriate limits and deductibles to mitigate the potential loss exposure of our business. We do not have financial reserves for policy deductibles and we do have exclusions under our insurance policies that are customary for our industry, including earthquakes, flood and terrorism. If any of our facilities or a significant amount or our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by insurance. 17 SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS BUSINESS SEGMENT: A significant reduction of funding to public schools could cause the demand for our modular classroom units to decline, which could result in a reduction in our revenues and profitability. Rentals and sales of modulars to public school districts for use as classrooms, restroom buildings, and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve represent a significant portion of Mobile Modulars rental and sales revenues. Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, developer fees and various taxes levied to support school operating budgets. Many of these funding sources are subject to financial and political considerations, which vary from district to district and are not tied to demand. Historically, we have benefited from the passage of facility bond measures and believe these are essential to our business. In California, our largest education market, state and local budgetary constraints have also affected the amount of funding received by public school districts. To the extent public school districts funding is reduced for the rental and purchase of modulars, our business could be harmed and our results of operations negatively impacted. We believe that interruptions or delays in the passage of facility bond measures, changes in legislative or educational policies at either the state or local level including the contraction or elimination of class size reduction programs, a lack or insufficient amount of fiscal funding, a significant reduction of funding to public schools, or changes negatively impacting enrollment may reduce the rental and sale demand for our educational products and may have a material adverse effect on both rental and sales revenue of the Company. Public policies that create demand for our products and services may change. California and Florida have passed legislation to limit the number of students that may be grouped in a single classroom for certain grade levels. School districts with class sizes in excess of these limits have been and continue to be a significant source of our demand for modular classrooms. Further, in California, efforts to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance have resulted in a significant increase in modernization and reconstruction projects by public school districts including seismic retrofitting, asbestos abatement and various building repairs and upgrades. If educational priorities and policies shift away from class-size reduction or modernization and reconstruction projects, demand for our products and services may decline, not grow as quickly as or reach the levels that we anticipate. Significant equipment returns may result in lower utilization until equipment can be redeployed or sold, which may cause rental rates to decline and negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows. Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular building industry, including the manufacturers and lessors of portable classrooms, are subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies at the federal, state and local level relating to environmental, zoning, health, safety and transportation matters, among other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could impact our business or harm our reputation and result in higher capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on our operations. As with conventional construction, typically new codes and regulations are not retroactively applied. Nonetheless, new governmental regulations in these or other areas may increase our acquisition cost of new rental equipment, limit the use of or make obsolete some of our existing equipment, or increase our general and administrative costs. Building codes are generally reviewed every three years. All aspects of a given code are subject to change including but not limited to such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. On occasion, state agencies have undertaken studies of indoor air quality and noise levels with a focus on permanent and modular classrooms. These results could impact our existing modular equipment, and affect the future construction of our modular product. Compliance with building codes and regulations entail a certain amount of risk as municipalities do not necessarily interpret these building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can 18 result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many best practices which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than the Companys. When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our profitability, operating cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Our planned expansions of our modular operations into new markets will affect our operating results. We have established modular operations in California, Texas and Florida and launched operations in North Carolina and Georgia in late 2007. We have identified several U.S. markets that we believe will be attractive long-term opportunities for our educational and commercial modular business and continue to consider opportunities for growth of our modular business. There are risks inherent in the undertaking of such expansion, including the risk of revenue from the business in these markets not meeting our expectations, higher than expected costs in entering these new markets, risk associated with compliance with applicable state laws and regulations, response by competitors and unanticipated consequences of expansion. In addition, expansion in new markets may by affected by local economic and market conditions. Expansion of our operations into these new markets will require a significant amount of attention from our management, a commitment of financial resources and will require us to add qualified management in these markets. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts. These laws and regulations make these government contracts more favorable to government entities than other third parties and any changes in these laws and regulations, or the failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts can differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts such as clauses that allow government entities not to perform on contractual obligations in the case of a lack of fiscal funding. Also, in the educational markets we serve, we are able to utilize piggyback contracts in marketing our products and services and ultimately to book business. The term piggyback contract refers to contracts for portable classrooms or other products entered into by public school districts following a formal bid process that allows for the use of the same contract terms and conditions with the successful vendor by other public school districts. As a result, piggyback contracts allow us to more readily book orders from our government customers, primarily public school districts, and to reduce the administrative expense associated with booking these orders. The governmental statutes and regulations that allow for use of piggyback contracts are subject to change or elimination in their entirety. A change in the manner of use or the elimination of piggyback contracts would likely negatively impact our ability to book new business from these government customers and could cause our administrative expenses related to processing these orders to increase significantly. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues which would harm our business and results from operations. Seasonality of our educational business may have adverse consequences for our business. A significant portion of the modular sale and rental revenues are derived from the educational market. Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. These factors may impact the quarterly revenues and earnings of each years second, third and fourth quarters. The differences in quarterly revenues and earnings may also be subject to fluctuations in state funding. In the past, impaired levels of funding available to the school districts from the states in which we do business have caused school districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations, class size reduction initiatives and modernization and reconstruction project needs. Any reductions in funding available to school districts from the states in which we do business could result in a lower volume of orders for our products which could reduce our revenues and operating income and consequently harm our financial condition. 19 We face strong competition in our modular building markets. The modular building leasing industry is highly competitive in our states of operation and we expect it to remain so. The competitive market in which we operate may prevent us from raising rental fees or sales prices to pass any increased costs on to our customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery times. We believe we may experience pricing pressures in our areas of operation in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. Some of our larger national competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably Williams Scotsman International, Inc. and Modspace, formed by the combination of the former GE Capital Modular Space and Resun Space Solutions, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. These larger competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the relocatable modular building market, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share, any of which could harm our business. We may not be able to quickly redeploy modular equipment returning from leases. As of December 31, 2007, 61% of our modular portfolio had equipment on rent for periods exceeding the original committed term. Generally, when a customer continues to rent the modular equipment beyond the contractual term, the equipment rents on a month-to-month basis. If a significant number of our rented modular units were returned during a short period of time, particularly those units that are rented on a month-to-month basis, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to continue expanding our rental fleet. Significant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our acquisition cost of new modular rental equipment and repair and maintenance costs of our fleet, which would increase our operating costs and harm our profitability. We incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including lumber, siding and roofing and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our modular equipment. The volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will also increase the acquisition cost of new modular equipment and increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a fleet of service trucks and use subcontractor companies for delivery, set-up, return delivery and dismantle of modulars for our customers. We rely on our subcontractor service companies to meet customer demands for timely shipment and return, and the loss or inadequate number of subcontractor service companies may cause prices to increase, while negatively impacting our reputation and operating performance. During periods of rising prices for labor, raw materials or fuel, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new modular equipment and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our reputation and financial condition. We are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modulars design specifications. With the exception of Enviroplex, none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the Company. During 2007, Mobile Modular purchased 33% of its modular product from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of its primary manufacturer of modulars could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer delivery lead times for modular product until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. Failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain the modular product may result in impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. We estimate the useful life of the modular product to be 18 years with a residual value of 50%. However, proper design, manufacture, repairs and maintenance of the modular product during our ownership is required for the product to reach the estimated useful life of 18 years with a residual value of 50%. If we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our modular product, or otherwise, delay or defer such repair or maintenance, we may be required to incur impairment 20 charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair, incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new modular product to serve demand and accordingly experience reduction of our future operating results and cash flows. Our warranty costs may increase. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings not manufactured by us are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. We provide ninety-day warranties on certain modular sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by our Enviroplex subsidiary. Historically, our warranty costs have not been significant, and we monitor the quality of our products closely. If a defect were to arise in the installation of our equipment at the customers facilities or in the equipment acquired from our suppliers or by our Enviroplex subsidiary, we may experience increased warranty claims. Such claims could disrupt our sales operations, damage our reputation and require costly repairs or other remedies, negatively impacting revenues and operating income. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT: Market risk and cyclical downturns in the industries using test equipment may result in periods of low demand for our product resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. TRS-RenTelcos revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment rental and sales revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure and maintenance. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which have a material adverse impact on the industrys demand for equipment, including the electronic test equipment rented by us. We experienced this in 2002, as a result of a significant and prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry, and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $24.1 million resulting from the depressed and low projected demand for the rental products coupled with high inventory levels, especially communications equipment. In addition, the severity and length of any downturn in an industry may also affect overall access to capital, which could adversely affect our customers. During periods of reduced and declining demand for test equipment, we are exposed to additional receivable risk from non-payment and may need to rapidly align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions while at the same time motivating and retaining key employees. While the market demand for communications test equipment has improved from 2002 levels as the telecommunications industry has recovered, no assurance can be given regarding the length or extent of the recovery, and no assurance can be given that our rental utilization rates, operating results and cash flows will not be adversely impacted by the reversal of any current trends or any future downturns or slowdowns in the rate of capital investment in this industry. Seasonality of our electronic test equipment business may impact quarterly results. Generally, rental activity declines in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These seasonal factors may impact quarterly results in each years first and fourth quarter. Our rental test equipment may become obsolete, which could result in an impairment charge. Electronic test equipment is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards that may render our existing equipment obsolete through new product introductions, or enhancements, before the end of its anticipated useful life, causing us to incur impairment charges. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. Additionally, some manufacturers of our equipment may be acquired or cease to exist, resulting in a future lack of support for equipment purchased from those manufacturers. This could result in the remaining useful life to shorten, causing us to incur an impairment charge. We monitor our manufacturers capacity to support their products, the introduction of new technologies, and 21 acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. Failure to properly select, manage and respond to the technological needs of our customers and changes of our products through their technology life cycle may cause certain electronic test equipment to become obsolete, resulting in impairment charges and may negatively impact operating results and cash flows. If we do not effectively compete in the rental equipment market, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected. The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Telogy and Continental Resources, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intensifying competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. We believe that we anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new products and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including product availability, price, service and reliability. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sale at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. Failure to adequately forecast the adoption of, and demand for, new or existing products may cause us not to meet our customers equipment requirements and may materially and adversely affect our operating results. If we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results. The majority of our rental equipment portfolio is comprised of general-purpose test and measurement instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as Agilent Technologies and Tektronix, a division of Danaher Corporation. We depend on purchasing equipment from these manufacturers and suppliers for use as our rental equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers demands in a timely manner or for a rental rate that generates a profit. If this should occur, we may not be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business may be materially and adversely affected. If we are not able to anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with operating internationally, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results. Currently, total foreign country customers and operations account for less than 10% of the Companys revenues and long-lived assets. In recent years some of our customers have expanded their international operations faster than domestic operations, and this trend may continue. Over time, we anticipate the amount of international business may increase if our focus on international market opportunities continues. Operating in foreign countries subjects the Company to additional risks, any of which may adversely impact our future operating results, including:  international political, economic and legal conditions including tariffs and trade barriers;  our ability to comply with customs, import/export and other trade compliance regulations of the countries in which we do business, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations;  greater difficulty in our ability to recover rental equipment and obtain payment of the related trade receivables;  difficulties in attracting and retaining staff and business partners to operate internationally;  language and cultural barriers;  seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located;  difficulty with the integration of foreign operations;  longer payment cycles;  currency fluctuations; and  potential adverse tax consequences.
