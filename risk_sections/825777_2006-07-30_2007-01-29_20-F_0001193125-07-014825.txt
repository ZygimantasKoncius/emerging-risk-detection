Risk factors, which may affect Coles Groups future performance, are discussed in Item 3D. 1 Table of Contents ITEM 1 IDENTITY OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT & ADVISERS Not applicable. ITEM 2 OFFER STATISTICS AND EXPECTED TIMETABLE Not applicable. ITEM 3 KEY INFORMATION A. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected income statement data for 2005 and 2006, and the selected balance sheet data as at July 31, 2005 and July 30, 2006 set forth below (other than percentages) are derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Coles Group included in this Annual Report. They should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, those statements, including the notes thereto. Coles Groups Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Australian International Financial Reporting Standards (AIFRS), which varies in certain material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP). A reconciliation to US GAAP is set out in note 41 of the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 17. It should be noted that results for 2006 reflect 52 trading weeks compared to 53 trading weeks for 2005. This is because the Companys fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in July each year and, as a result, approximately every six years an extra trading week is included in the Companys consolidated results for that fiscal year. In accordance with the instructions to the Form 20-F, owing to the change in the body of the accounting principles used in preparing the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from Australian generally accepted accounting principles to AIFRS, only two years of financial statements have been presented. 2 Table of Contents Amounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 2006(1)US$ 2006 A$ 2005(2) A$ (In millions, except per shareamounts) Consolidated Income Statement Revenue from sale of goods (3) 28,122.0 36,698.4 36,167.8 Other operating revenue 102.9 134.3 123.1 Revenue (excluding finance income) 28,224.9 36,832.7 36,290.9 Revenue from sale of goods  from continuing operations (3) 26,216.7 34,212.0 33,018.2 Other operating revenue  from continuing operations 70.3 91.8 71.9 Revenue (excluding finance income)  from continuing operations 26,287.0 34,303.8 33,090.1 Profit from ordinary activities before income tax-total 1,055.9 1,377.9 903.2 Profit from ordinary activities before income tax  from continuing operations 576.3 752.0 972.0 Profit/(loss) from ordinary activities before income tax  from discontinued operations 479.6 625.9 (68.8 ) Income tax expense (164.2 ) (214.3 ) (265.3 ) Income tax expense  from continuing operations (165.2 ) (215.6 ) (285.9 ) Income tax expense  from discontinued operations 1.0 1.3 20.6 Profit for the year  total 891.7 1,163.6 637.9 Profit for the year  from continuing operations 411.0 536.4 686.1 Profit/(loss) for the year  from discontinued operations 480.6 627.2 (48.2 ) Per Ordinary Share: - Basic earnings  from continuing operations 0.33 0.43 0.52 - Basic earnings  from discontinued operations 0.38 0.50 (0.04 ) - Basic earnings  from total operations 0.71 0.93 0.48 - Diluted earnings  from continuing operations 0.33 0.43 0.52 - Diluted earnings  from discontinued operations 0.38 0.49 (0.03 ) - Diluted earnings  from total operations 0.70 0.92 0.49 - Cash dividends 0.280 0.365 0.313 Consolidated Balance Sheet (at year end) Total assets 7,000.4 9,135.3 9,223.8 Contributed equity 1,643.1 2,144.2 2,068.6 Total equity 2,757.1 3,598.0 3,415.1 (1) Merely for the convenience of the reader, certain selected financial data has been converted into United States Dollars at the Noon Buying Rate on July 28, 2006, the last trading day of the fiscal year, of A$1.00 = US$0.7663.

RISK FACTORS This section describes some of the risks that could affect the Companys business. The factors below should be considered in connection with any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. The risks below are not the only ones the Company faces  some risks may not be known to the Company, and some, which are not currently considered to be material, could later turn out to be material. The major risk factors, which may impact Coles Group, include: Risks Related to Coles Group There is a risk that if the Companys strategic plan is not clearly defined and communicated, the Company will be unsuccessful in fulfilling its vision to be a great retailer that customers turn to first for their everyday shopping purchases. The Companys vision is to be a great retailer that customers turn to first for their everyday shopping purchases. Well-judged customer propositions and successful marketing programs influence the continued growth of retail profitability. Critical factors to Coles Group maintaining its competitive position are: (i) the ability of Coles Group to successfully gauge and satisfy consumer preferences, and to reward customer loyalty; (ii) merchandising skills to enable improvement in product range to better meet customer needs; (iii) ability to source products in a timely and efficient manner; and (iv) appropriate price positioning. The Company needs an appropriate framework of structures and processes that support the Group through the implementation of this strategy. If the appropriate structures and processes are not in place, the Company may miss or have inadequate responses to the market and new market opportunities. There is a risk that the Company may not fully realize expected benefits from better leverage of the Groups operations. The Groups future plans include expected benefits from greater efficiencies in areas that are common across the Group (in particular Supply Chain and Information Technology) and access to greater economies of scale. There is a risk that the Company may not leverage the benefits available from the scale, depth and breadth of its retail capability. If the Company is not able to realize these benefits or identify other sources of benefits, its future ability to reduce costs and remain competitive may be reduced. There is a risk that the Company may not fully realize expected savings from its simplification program. One of the key planks of the Companys current strategy is the reduction of support costs and reinvestment into stores, facilitated by the integration of certain brands. This is expected to result in the loss of 2,500 permanent support staff by the end of 2008. The Group has many different systems that are complex and subject to interdependencies. There is a risk that systems cannot be integrated according to plan. This may have an adverse impact on the Companys ability to rationalize its workforce. If the Company is not able to fully realize these savings or identify other sources of benefits its future ability to remain competitive may be reduced. There is a risk that if the Company is unable to implement its simplification program, the future performance of the Group may be affected. The cost, potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of simplification initiatives may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Enhancements to processes and systems may not provide the benefits when anticipated. These risks may result in the businesses not receiving the level of support that they require, and their future profitability may be affected. There is a risk that the Company may put too much focus on Group change. The Company continues to have a significant agenda of implementing change across the Group, particularly in Retail Support areas such as Supply Chain and Information Technology. There is a risk that if the change agenda is not well managed, there may be a loss of focus with inadequate resources being directed to core retail activities. If these core retail activities do not perform in line with expectations, there is a risk that the Companys future financial performance may suffer. 6 Table of Contents There is a risk that the Companys customer proposition is unsuccessful, which may affect its future competitive position and growth opportunities. The Company must regularly evaluate its customer proposition for each of its brands in a dynamic and competitive marketplace. Growth initiatives are based on: (i) expanding share within existing markets through differentiated product offers and competitive pricing; or (ii) identifying new retail opportunities. Two of the key planks of the Groups current strategy include the review of store formats and product initiatives. The success of this strategy depends on managements ability to identify and respond to consumer preferences. Product initiatives may require the Company to identify new suppliers, who meet our standards in a timely and efficient manner. There is a risk that if the Company does not successfully innovate and improve its customer offer, its market share and future growth may be impacted. If Coles Group is unable to locate appropriate store sites, it may not be able to deliver expected store growth. The Companys growth strategy includes the opening of new stores, together with the enhancement of existing store formats. Coles Groups ability to open new stores is dependent on identifying and entering into leases on commercially reasonable terms for properties that are suitable for its needs. If Coles Group fails to identify and enter into leases at premium retail sites, the Companys growth may be impaired. There is a risk that some of the Companys stores may underperform. Individual stores may underperform for a number of reasons (e.g. poor positioning, poor execution, fluctuations in trends and markets, and the Companys failure or inability to swiftly respond to these). There is a risk that the cost of exiting such low returning sites may be prohibitive. If the Company fails to regularly monitor underperforming stores, and to take appropriate remedial action, such stores will adversely affect profitability. There is a risk that if the Company is unable to implement its new Information Technology (IT) systems and transform the Supply Chain the future performance of the Group may be affected. The Companys growth strategy includes significant investment in new IT systems. Coles Group has a large number of systems, and there is a risk that if Coles Group does not adequately implement the IT strategy to support improvement and efficiency across the business, its future profitability may be affected. The transformation of the Supply Chain is a major initiative for the Company, and is intended to result in better service for customers, simpler processes for stores and lower costs for Coles Group. The initiative is complex, with risks including delays and interruptions. Presently, the Supply Chain is changing rapidly, and consequently the risk of interruption increases. These risks may result in the Company not achieving the expected benefits within expected timeframes. There is a risk that the Companys growth strategy may be affected if there are insufficient skills across the Group to support its implementation. There is a risk of the loss of key members of the senior management team, which may impede the implementation of the Groups strategies. It is expected that the Companys simplification program will result in the loss of 2,500 permanent support staff by the end of 2008. The loss of key staff may result in interruption or could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short-term. It could take longer than expected to realize benefits if transition planning is not appropriate. The loss of key personnel or insufficient management or leadership skills may mean that the Companys growth strategy does not meet expectations. There is a risk that industrial action may affect the Companys operations, impacting business and financial performance. Coles Group has traditionally had a stable industrial relations environment within its operations. However, there is a risk of industrial unrest or interruption, particularly within distribution centers, in the context of transformation programs, which are currently significantly affecting operations. Any industrial action may increase costs, impact operations and delay transformation initiatives. 7 Table of Contents There is a trend of increasing competition (from existing and new competitors) in the markets within which Coles Group operates which may affect the results from its retail operations. There is significant competition in the Australian and New Zealand markets in which Coles Groups businesses operate. Retail chains generally compete on the basis of location, quality of products, service, price, product variety and store condition. Take-over activity amongst existing competitors intensifies competition. There is also the risk of new entrants into the Australian retail market, either by acquisition of an existing retailing company or through greenfields development. Regulatory authorities may constrain the Company from growing existing brands, particularly within the Food and Liquor Group. As Coles Group operates in a broad range of retail sectors (food and liquor, discount department stores, convenience stores, fuel retailing, etc) it is exposed to competition in almost all retail sectors of the Australian market. These competitive conditions may adversely impact Coles Groups market share and trading results. There is a risk that the divestment of the Myer business may affect the Companys profitability. During 2006 the Coles Group divested the Myer business. There is a risk that the new owners of the Myer business will compete directly with the merchandise and apparel businesses of the Coles Group. There is a risk that the Coles Groups market share and future growth may be impacted. As a consequence of the divestment, Coles Group guaranteed the performance of Myer under certain leases. These guarantees amount to A$164.6 million and primarily expire within a maximum of four years. There is a risk that the Myer business may fail and these guarantees may be called upon. Coles Group faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims and adverse publicity. The packaging, marketing, distribution and sale of food products entail an inherent risk of product liability, product recall, adverse publicity and exposure to product liability claims. Such claims may have an adverse impact on the Companys financial performance. There is a risk that if the Company is not able to improve its Health and Safety record, the associated costs may decrease profitability. Continuing to improve the Health and Safety record is a major management focus through the Safety Right Now program. This program focuses on creating a safer environment for staff, customers and visitors to all business locations. There is a risk that if the Company is not able to maintain the improving Health and Safety record, the costs associated with workers compensation may increase and affect the future competitive position of the Company. There is a risk that long-term exchange rate fluctuations may impact the costs of imports. The Company sources merchandise, both directly and indirectly, from overseas denominated in either Australian dollars or foreign currency. All foreign exchange exposures arising from the importation of merchandise (including freight and customs), capital expenditure and other goods (for example back of house items, fees and expenses), and also foreign currency denominated borrowings, and offshore investments are fully hedged. There is a risk that long-term permanent depreciation of the Australian dollar may impact the Companys future sourcing costs. There is a risk of non-compliance with governance, corporations law and other listed company obligations and expectations, which may have a negative impact on the Companys performance. Coles Group is subject to many laws and regulations including, but not limited to, trade practices, corporations law, employment laws, workers compensation and rehabilitation, occupational health and safety, tax and accounting legislation, including the Financial Services Act, State, Territory and local government legislation and regulations that govern property planning issues, liquor licensing, tobacco retailing, retail trading hours and other operational matters, environmental regulation and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws (which may be brought about by interest lobby groups) may reduce the sales and profitability of Coles Groups operations and may otherwise adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or results. 8 Table of Contents There is a risk that failure of our internal control over financial reporting may have a negative impact on the Companys financial results. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Owing to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. There is a risk that any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control may limit our ability to report our financial results accurately or to detect and prevent fraud. Risks Related to Australia The Companys financial prospects, both in terms of sales and profits are primarily dependent on the Australian economic environment. The retail trading environment is subject to general economic conditions in the Australian and global markets. The economic conditions in Australia are influenced by a number of factors, including climatic conditions such as the sustained period of drought currently being experienced in Australia, which may impact on the level of disposable income available to consumers to spend in the Companys stores. Any adverse changes in such economic conditions can be expected to affect the retail-trading environment in general. Adverse developments in economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year of Coles Group, particularly the Christmas trading period when its sales and profitability are typically strongest, may have a negative impact on Coles Groups trading results. The Companys future financial results, in terms of sales and borrowing costs, may be negatively impacted by higher interest rates. Higher interest rates affect income available for spending, which can impact the level of retail sales. Higher interest rates also affect the Companys cost of borrowing and may reduce its profitability. The foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive and we do not undertake to revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statement is made.
