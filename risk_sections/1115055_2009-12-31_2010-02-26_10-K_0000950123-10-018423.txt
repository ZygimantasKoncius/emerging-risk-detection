ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves various risks which are particular to our company, our industry and our market area. Several risk factors regarding investing in our common stock are discussed below. This listing should not be considered as all-inclusive. If any of the following risks were to occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition or operating results could be negatively impacted. These matters could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline in future periods. Negative developments in the U.S. and local economy and in local real estate markets have adversely impacted our results and may continue to adversely impact our results in the future. Economic conditions in the markets in which we operate have deteriorated significantly since early 2008. As a result, we have experienced a significant reduction in our earnings, resulting primarily from provisions for loan losses related to declining collateral values in our real estate construction and development loan portfolio. We believe that this difficult economic environment will continue in 2010, and we expect that our results of operations will continue to be negatively impacted as a result. There can be no assurance that the economic conditions that have adversely affected the financial services industry, and the capital, credit and real estate markets generally or us in particular, will improve in the near future, or thereafter, in which case we could continue to experience significant losses and write-downs of assets, and could face capital and liquidity constraints or other business challenges. Our loan portfolio includes a significant amount of real estate construction and development loans, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans. The percentage of real estate construction and development loans in Pinnacle Nationals portfolio was approximately 14.7% of total loans at December 31, 2009, and these loans make up approximately 58.2% of our non-performing loans at December 31, 2009. This type of lending is generally considered to have relatively high credit risks because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project. Consequently, these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy. Prior to 2009, the number of newly constructed homes or lots sold in our market areas had continued to decline, negatively affecting collateral values and contributing to increased provision expense and higher levels of non-performing assets. During 2009, year over year sales did increase somewhat. However, a continued reduction in residential real estate market prices and demand could result in further price reductions in home and land values adversely affecting the value of collateral securing the construction and development loans that we hold. These adverse economic and real estate market conditions may lead to further increases in non-performing loans and other real estate owned, increased charge offs from the disposition of non-performing assets, and increases in provision for loan losses, all of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We have a concentration of credit exposure to borrowers in certain industries and we also target small to medium-sized businesses. At December 31, 2009, we had significant credit exposures to borrowers in certain businesses, including commercial and residential building lessors, new home builders, and land subdividers. These industries are experiencing adversity in the current recession and, as a result, an increased level of borrowers in these industries have been unable to perform their obligations under their existing loan agreements with us, or have suffered loan downgrades which has negatively impacted our results of operations. If the current recessionary environment continues, these industry concentrations could result in higher than normal deterioration in credit quality, past dues, loan charge offs and collateral value declines, which could cause our earnings to be negatively impacted. Furthermore, any of our large credit exposures that deteriorate unexpectedly could cause us to have to make significant additional loan loss provisions, negatively impacting our earnings. Additionally, a substantial focus of our marketing and business strategy is to serve small to medium-sized businesses in the Nashville and Knoxville MSAs. As a result, a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans primarily to small to medium-sized businesses. At December 31, 2009, our commercial and industrial loans accounted for almost 30.0% of our total loans. Additionally, 15.4% of our loans are to businesses secured by the real estate they used to support their businesses (i.e. owner/occupied). During periods of economic weakness like those we are currently experiencing, small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more severely and more quickly than larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of such businesses to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Page 16 Table of Contents We are geographically concentrated in the Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee MSAs, and changes in local economic conditions impact our profitability. We currently operate primarily in the Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee MSAs, and most of our loan, deposit and other customers live or have operations in these areas. Accordingly, our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in these markets, along with the continued attraction of business ventures to the areas, and our profitability is impacted by the changes in general economic conditions in these markets. Economic conditions in the Nashville and Knoxville MSAs weakened during 2009, negatively affecting our operations, particularly the real estate construction and development segment of our loan portfolio. Additionally, unemployment levels rose significantly in both markets in 2009 from 2008 levels. We cannot assure you that economic conditions in our markets will improve during 2010 or thereafter, and continued weak economic conditions in our markets could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or return of more favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur. If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. If loan customers with significant loan balances fail to repay their loans, our earnings and capital levels will suffer. We make various assumptions and judgments about the probable losses in our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of any collateral securing the loans. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to cover our estimate of the probable losses in our loan portfolio. In determining the size of this allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio based on volume and types of loans, internal loan classifications, trends in classifications, volume and trends in delinquencies, nonaccruals and charge-offs, national and local economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications, and other pertinent factors and information. If our assumptions are inaccurate, our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover potential loan losses, and additional provisions may be necessary which would decrease our earnings. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our loan portfolio and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize loan charge-offs. Their conclusions about the quality of our loan portfolio may be different than ours. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our operating results. Moreover, additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our managements control. These additions may require increased provision expense which would negatively impact our results of operations. We have increased levels of other real estate owned, primarily as a result of foreclosures, and we anticipate higher levels of foreclosed real estate expense. As we have begun to resolve non-performing real estate loans, we have increased the level of foreclosed properties primarily those acquired from builders and from residential land developers. Foreclosed real estate expense consists of three types of charges: maintenance costs, valuation adjustments to appraisal values and gains or losses on disposition. As levels of other real estate owned increase and also as local real estate values decline, these charges will increase, negatively impacting our results of operations. Legislative and regulatory initiatives that were enacted in response to the financial crisis are beginning to wind down. The U.S. federal, state and foreign governments have taken various actions in an attempt to deal with the worldwide financial crisis that began in the second half of 2008 and the severe decline in the global economy. Some of these programs are beginning to expire and the impact of the wind down on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown. In the United States, EESA was enacted on October 3, 2008. The TARP, established pursuant to EESA, includes the CPP, pursuant to which the U.S. Treasury is authorized to purchase senior preferred stock and common or preferred stock warrants from participating financial institutions. TARP also authorized the purchase of other securities and financial instruments for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to U.S. financial markets. The Transaction Account Guarantee portion of the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which guarantees noninterest bearing bank transaction accounts on an unlimited basis is scheduled to continue until June 30, 2010. Page 17 Table of Contents National or state legislation or regulation may increase our expenses and reduce earnings. Federal bank regulators are increasing regulatory scrutiny, and additional restrictions on financial institutions have been proposed by regulators and by Congress. Changes in tax law, federal legislation, regulation or policies, such as bankruptcy laws, deposit insurance, consumer protection laws, and capital requirements, among others, can result in significant increases in our expenses and/or charge-offs, which may adversely affect our earnings. Changes in state or federal tax laws or regulations can have a similar impact. Many state and municipal governments, including the State of Tennessee, are under financial stress due to the economy. As a result, these governments could seek to increase their tax revenues through increased tax levies which could have a meaningful impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, financial institution regulatory agencies are expected to continue to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the continued issuance of additional formal or informal enforcement or supervisory actions. These actions, whether formal or informal, could result in our agreeing to limitations or to take actions that limit our operational flexibility, restrict our growth or increase our capital or liquidity levels. Failure to comply with any formal or informal regulatory restrictions, including informal supervisory actions, could lead to further regulatory enforcement actions. Negative developments in the financial services industry and the impact of recently enacted or new legislation in response to those developments could negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, industry, legislative or regulatory developments may cause us to materially change our existing strategic direction, capital strategies, compensation or operating plans. We may not be able to continue to expand into the Knoxville MSA in the time frame and at the levels that we currently expect. In order to continue our expansion into the Knoxville MSA, we will be required to hire additional associates and build out a branch network. We cannot assure you that we will be able to hire the number of experienced associates that we need to successfully execute our strategy in the Knoxville MSA, nor can we assure you that the associates we hire will be able to successfully execute our growth strategy in that market. Additionally, we are required to seek OCC approval prior to the construction of any new branch facility, which cannot be assured. Because we seek to hire experienced associates, the compensation cost associated with these individuals may be higher than that of other financial institutions of similar size in the market. If we are unable to grow our loan portfolio at planned rates or slow our growth in the Knoxville MSA, the increased compensation expense of these experienced associates may negatively impact our results of operations. Because there will be a period of time before we are able to fully deploy our resources in the Knoxville MSA, our start up costs, including the cost of our associates and our branch expansion, will negatively impact our results of operations. Our ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity could be impacted by changes in the capital markets and deteriorating economic and market conditions. We, and Pinnacle National, are required to maintain certain capital levels established by banking regulations or specified by bank regulators. We must also maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support our operations and fund outstanding liabilities. Our ability to maintain capital levels, sources of funding and liquidity could be impacted by changes in the capital markets in which we operate and deteriorating economic and market conditions. Additionally, Pinnacle National is now required to maintain its Tier 1 leverage capital ratio at a minimum of 8% and its total risk-based capital ratio at a minimum of 12%. Failure by our bank subsidiary to meet applicable capital guidelines or to satisfy certain other regulatory requirements could subject our bank subsidiary to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. Although we have initiated efforts to reduce our reliance on noncore funding, this type of funding still represents a large component of our funding base. In addition to the traditional core deposits, such as demand deposit accounts, interest checking, money market savings and certificates of deposits, we utilize several noncore funding sources, such as brokered certificates of deposit, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Cincinnati advances, federal funds purchased and other sources. We utilize these noncore funding sources to fund the ongoing operations and growth of Pinnacle National. The availability of these noncore funding sources is subject to broad economic conditions and, as such, the cost of funds may fluctuate significantly and/or be restricted, thus impacting our net interest income, our immediate liquidity and/or our access to additional liquidity. Brokered certificates of deposit have received scrutiny from regulators in recent months. We impose upon ourselves limitations as to the absolute level of brokered deposits we may have on our balance sheet at any point in time, and we have committed to bank regulators to reduce our level of brokered deposits. The pricing of these deposits are subject to the broader wholesale funding market and the depositors views on our financial strength and may fluctuate significantly in a very short period of time. Additionally, the availability of these deposits is impacted by overall market conditions as investors determine whether to invest in less risky certificates of deposit or in riskier debt and equity markets. As money flows between these various investment Page 18 Table of Contents instruments, market conditions will impact the pricing and availability of brokered funds, which may negatively impact our liquidity and cost of funds. We impose certain internal limits as to the absolute level of noncore funding we will incur at any point in time. Should we exceed those limitations, we may need to modify our growth plans, liquidate certain assets, participate loans to correspondents or execute other actions to allow for us to return to an acceptable level of noncore funding within a reasonable amount of time. If the federal funds rate remains at current extremely low levels, our net interest margin, and consequently our net earnings, may be negatively impacted. Because of significant competitive deposit pricing pressures in our market and the negative impact of these pressures on our cost of funds, coupled with the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio has variable rate pricing that moves in concert with changes to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors federal funds rate (which is at an extremely low rate as a result of the current recession), we experienced net interest margin compression throughout 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009. Because of these competitive pressures, we were unable to lower the rate that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities to the same extent and as quickly as the yields we charged on interest-earning assets. As a result, our net interest margin, and consequently our profitability, was negatively impacted. During 2009 we took various actions, including establishing interest rate floors on certain variable rate loans and reducing our level of non-core funding, which improved our net interest margin in 2009. Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability. The absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates may affect our level of interest income, the primary component of our gross revenue, as well as the level of our interest expense. Interest rate fluctuations are caused by many factors which, for the most part, are not under our control. For example, national monetary policy plays a significant role in the determination of interest rates. Additionally, competitor pricing and the resulting negotiations that occur with our customers also impact the rates we collect on loans and the rates we pay on deposits. As interest rates change, we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this gap may work against us, and our earnings may be negatively affected. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. A decline in the market value of our assets may limit our ability to borrow additional funds. As a result, we could be required to sell some of our loans and investments under adverse market conditions, upon terms that are not favorable to us, in order to maintain our liquidity. If those sales are made at prices lower than the amortized costs of the investments, we will incur losses. Our stock price can be volatile. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:  Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations.  Recommendations by securities analysts.  Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us.  News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry.  Perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors.  New technology used, or services offered, by competitors.  Changes in government regulations.  Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results. Page 19 Table of Contents A decline in our stock price or expected future cash flows, or a material adverse change in our results of operations or prospects, could result in impairment of our goodwill. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization below book value, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of our goodwill. If we were to conclude that a write-down of our goodwill is necessary, then the appropriate charge would likely cause a material loss. Any significant loss would further adversely impact the capacity of Pinnacle National to pay dividends to us without seeking prior regulatory approval, which could adversely affect our ability to pay required interest payments and preferred stock dividends. An investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit. Our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment. We have a significant deferred tax asset and cannot assure you that it will be fully realized. We had net deferred tax assets of $25.5 million as of December 31, 2009. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009 because we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we considered the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the ability to carryback losses to prior years, tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income based on management prepared forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Competition with other banking institutions could adversely affect our profitability. A number of banking institutions in the Nashville market have higher lending limits, more banking offices, and a larger market share of loans or deposits. In addition, our asset management division competes with numerous brokerage firms and mutual fund companies which are also much larger. In some respects, this may place these competitors in a competitive advantage, although many of our customers have selected us because of service quality concerns at the larger enterprises. This competition may limit or reduce our profitability, reduce our growth and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Loss of our senior executive officers or other key employees could impair our relationship with our customers and adversely affect our business. We have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services in the Nashville market. Loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our earnings because of their skills, customer relationships and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them. The limitations on bonuses, retention awards, severance payments and incentive compensation contained in ARRA may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees. For so long as any equity securities that we issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP remain outstanding, ARRA severely restricts bonuses, retention awards, severance payments and other incentive compensation payable to our most highly compensated employees including our senior executive officers. It is possible that we may be unable to create a compensation structure that permits us to retain such officers or other key employees or recruit additional employees, especially if we are competing against institutions that are not subject to the same restrictions. Regulatory approval may be required in order to add or replace certain executive officers. Most of our key employees are not subject to non-competition or non-solicitation agreements. Failure to retain our key employees could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders. In order to maintain our or Pinnacle Nationals capital at desired or regulatory-required levels or to replace existing capital such as our Series A preferred stock, we may be required to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. We may sell these shares at prices below the current Page 20 Table of Contents market price of shares, and the sale of these shares may significantly dilute shareholder ownership. We could also issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions. Even though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Markets Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange. The trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other stock exchanges. Although we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock, we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop. Because of this, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. If a change in control is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. Provisions in our corporate documents, as well as certain federal and state regulations, may make it difficult and expensive to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that our board of directors opposes. As a result, our shareholders may not have an opportunity to participate in such a transaction, and the trading price of our stock may not rise to the level of other institutions that are more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our charter also will make it more difficult for an outside shareholder to remove our current board of directors or management. Holders of Pinnacle Financials bank indebtedness and junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of Pinnacle Financials common shareholders. Pinnacle Financial has supported its continued growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying junior subordinated debentures. At December 31, 2009, Pinnacle Financial had outstanding trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures totaling $82.5 million. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts are conditionally guaranteed by Pinnacle Financial. Further, the accompanying junior subordinated debentures Pinnacle Financial issued to the trusts are senior to Pinnacle Financials shares of common stock and preferred stock. As a result, Pinnacle Financial must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on its preferred stock, common stock and, in the event of Pinnacle Financials bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on Pinnacle Financials common stock and preferred stock. Pinnacle Financial has the right to defer distributions on its junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on its common stock or preferred stock. If losses continue or if our financial condition deteriorates, we may be required to cease paying dividends on our preferred stock and to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures. Our business is dependent on technology, and an inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. We have made significant investments in data processing, management information systems and internet banking accessibility. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to create additional efficiencies in our operations through the use of technology, particularly in light of our past and projected growth strategy. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We cannot make assurances that our technological improvements will increase our operational efficiency or that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Page 21 Table of Contents We are subject to various statutes and regulations that may impose additional costs or limit our ability to take certain actions. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged on loans, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to capital requirements established by our regulators, which require us to maintain specified levels of capital. Recent bank and thrift closures have depleted the Deposit Insurance Fund, and we were assessed a $2.3 million special assessment in the second quarter of 2009 and were required to prepay our risk based assessment for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 in the fourth quarter of 2009. It is possible that our assessments may increase in the future. Any future assessment increases could negatively impact our results of operations. Significant changes in laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry have been recently adopted and others are being considered in Congress. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.
