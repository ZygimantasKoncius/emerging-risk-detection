Risk Factors Our business is subject to a number of risks, including but not limited to the following: We have a working capital deficit At December 31, 2005, we had a working capital deficit of $687,039 and at December 31, 2004, we had a working capital deficit of $3.5 million. The working capital deficit is the result of previously incurred losses from operations, our decision to finance capital projects with cash generated from operations, and our need to fund rapid growth in sales. We may be unable to secure an adequate quantity and quality of raw materials at economical prices The largest component of our raw material costs is scrap polyethylene. The price that we must pay for these materials is related to the market prices of natural gas and petroleum, which have been rising and volatile in recent years. Our future profitability is contingent on us being able to manage raw material costs under these circumstances. 6 Table of Contents The loss of one or more of our key customers could cause a substantial reduction in our revenues and profits We could be materially adversely affected if we were to lose one or more of our large existing customers. Our principal customer for our decking material is Weyerhaeuser, which accounted for 77% and 81% of our sales in 2005 and 2004, respectively. A few large door and window construction companies have historically purchased substantially all of our industrial component products. A loss of any one of our large customers would adversely affect our sales and profitability. If we are unable to comply with certain debt covenants, our financial position and operations could be adversely affected The bond agreement contains financial covenants, which include a current ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 and a requirement that not more than 10% of accounts payable be in excess of 75 days past the invoice date. We were not in compliance with these two covenants at December 31, 2005; however, these covenants were waived by the bondholder as of December 31, 2005 through, and including, December 31, 2006. There is no assurance that we will be able to comply with these debt covenants in the future, or that the bondholder will waive or modify the covenants in the future. If we are unable to comply with the covenants or obtain a waiver or modification of the covenants in the future, then the bond debt, currently in the amount of $12.9 million, could immediately become due and payable, the bondholder could foreclose on the property used to secure the debt, and the bondholder could claim our revenues pledged as part of the bond agreement. Restrictions regarding increased manufacturing capabilities could restrain our business growth We increased our sales by $23.7 million in 2005, $20.1 million in 2004 and $2.1 million in 2003, the year in which there was a fire that temporarily shut down our Junction, Texas manufacturing facility. Our products have seen significant growth, and our customers have significant established expansion plans. Our primary customers and markets are large, and continued sales growth will require significant capital expenditures for additional production equipment and manufacturing facilities. Although our goal is to become the number one composite producer in North America, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure the necessary financing, attain the necessary operational execution, or that the equipment and facilities will become operational in a timely manner to meet that goal. Our growth is limited by the availability of human capital resources Future profitable growth will require us to recruit and retain qualified associates. We compete with many larger companies in the labor market, many of whom offer more attractive compensation packages than we are able to economically provide. Though we have adopted equity compensation plans to aid in our efforts to recruit and retain qualified associates, the accounting treatment for those plans results in a reduction in our earnings. Declines in construction activity may adversely affect our business Our products are sold in the home improvement and new home construction markets. These markets are subject to significant fluctuations in activity and to periodic downturns caused by general economic conditions. A slowdown in construction activity could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. Fire disruptions may adversely affect our business Our raw materials and manufacturing processes involve a greater than average risk of fire loss or disruption. Through the CompanyÂ’s history, we have experienced several fires, some of which severely disrupted our manufacturing operations. There was an accidental fire at our Junction, Texas facility in March 2003, which caused substantial damage and temporarily shut down plant operations. Although we have increased security and increased fire protection equipment at our facilities, another major fire could occur and materially adversely affect our operations. 7 Table of Contents Covenants in our bond agreements could restrict our ability to borrow, which could impair the improvement and expansion of our operations Certain covenants in our bond agreements restrict the types and amounts of additional indebtedness that we may incur, including a requirement that, with certain exceptions, we may only incur additional indebtedness to the extent it would satisfy a debt incurrence coverage ratio of 250% of income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to debt service. Those restrictions could inhibit our ability to improve and expand our current operations. Additionally, our ability to secure adequate working capital to support our day-to-day operations as we grow could be limited by the covenants in our bond agreements. Future sales of shares could be dilutive and impair our ability to raise capital The conversion of a significant number of our outstanding derivative securities into Class A common stock could adversely affect the market price of the stock. There are currently warrants outstanding for 9,176,242 shares of Class A common stock at an average exercise price of $1.05, and options outstanding for 3,688,130 shares of Class A common stock at an average exercise price of $1.01. The exercise or conversion of a material amount of such securities will result in a dilution in interest for our other security holders. The convertible securities whether converted into stock or not, could impair our ability to obtain additional capital because of the potential for dilution. Also, the holders of such securities may be expected to exercise their rights at a time when we would in all likelihood be able to obtain needed capital through a new offering of our securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the outstanding securities. The high growth rate in demand for our products will eventually slow The demand for our decking products has increased rapidly over the past three years due to growing consumer awareness of the benefits of composite decking and the marketing efforts of our customers who sell our products to end users. As annual sales of composite decking increase, it is likely that the growth rate of our decking sales will slow. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. We have no unresolved staff comments.
