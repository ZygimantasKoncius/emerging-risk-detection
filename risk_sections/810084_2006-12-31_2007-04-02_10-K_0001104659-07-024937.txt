We develop needle-free injection systems that improve the way patients take medications and vaccines. Our long-term goal is to become the leading supplier of needle-free injection systems to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In 2006, we continued to focus our business development efforts on new and existing licensing and supply agreements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. By bundling customized needle-free delivery systems with partners injectable medications and vaccines, we can enhance demand for these products in the healthcare provider and end user markets. In 2006, our clinical research efforts continued to be aimed primarily at collaborations in the areas of vaccines and drug delivery. Currently, we are involved in collaborations with 12 institutions. In 2006, our research and development efforts focused on the Iject® single use disposable product. In addition, we continued to work on product improvements to existing devices and the development of products for our strategic partners. Our needle-free injection technology works by forcing liquid medication at high speed through a tiny orifice held against the skin. This creates a fine stream of high-pressure medication that penetrates the skin, depositing the medication in the tissue beneath. Since our formation, we have been engaged principally in organizational, financing, research and development, and marketing activities. Our products and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive government regulation, both in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., the development, manufacture, marketing and promotion of medical devices is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under section 510(k) or other FDA regulations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). We are actively pursuing strategic partnering relationships with a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under which we plan to grant specified rights or licenses to some or all of our products. The strategy anticipates that the rights or licenses will allow strategic partners to i) use the licensed products for specific applications or purposes or ii) market the licensed products in conjunction with certain of their products. We currently have active licensing and/or development agreements, which often include commercial product supply provisions, with Serono, Merial, an undisclosed European biotechnology company, an undisclosed pharmaceutical company, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health and Vical. Serono In December 1999, we announced an exclusive license agreement with Serono Laboratories, Inc. (Serono), the U.S. affiliate of Serono, S.A., a leading biotechnology company headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, to deliver Seronos Saizen® recombinant human growth hormone with a customized version of our Vitajet® needle-free delivery system, the cool.click, in the U.S. and Canada. In connection with the agreement, Serono paid us a license fee and signed a definitive supply agreement that commenced upon FDA clearance. No technology development fees were required under the agreement. The license fee is being recognized over the seven-year term of the agreement. During the third quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, we amended our agreement with Serono to provide Serono with exclusive worldwide distribution rights for its Saizen® recombinant human growth hormone using the cool.click. In addition, Serono was given exclusive worldwide rights to use a customized version of the Vitajet®, the SeroJet, for AIDS wasting applications. In exchange for the 2 exclusive worldwide licenses, we received an additional licensing fee, which is being recognized over the remaining term of the agreement. The agreement may be terminated by mutual written agreement, by Serono for convenience and by either party for failure to meet contractual obligations, for breach and for insolvency. We also have a supply agreement with Serono. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, deferred revenue related to Serono was $50,000 and $117,000, respectively. We recognized revenue related to these licensing and supply agreements totaling $2.2 million, $3.7 million and $3.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Merial In August 2002, we entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement with Merial, the worlds leading animal health company, for delivery of Merials veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines utilizing a veterinary focused needle-free injector system for production animals, which is currently in development. The agreement provides for monthly payments to us for product development, with additional payments when key product development and regulatory milestones are achieved. The agreement has a five-year term. Commercialization was achieved in February 2007. In March 2004, we signed a second license and supply agreement with Merial. Under terms of this agreement, we provided Merial with an exclusive license for use of a modified version of our Vitajet® needle-free injector system for use in veterinary clinics to administer vaccines for the companion animal market. The agreement provides for monthly payments to us for product development, with additional payments when key product development and regulatory milestones are achieved. The agreement has a five-year term with a three-year automatic renewal. This product was commercialized in 2005. In November and December 2005, we signed three new agreements with Merial. The agreements are for three projects, which include performing feasibility analyses for a next generation Vetjet device for the companion animal market, as well as for devices for production animal and poultry markets. Each agreement includes the payment of an upfront, non-refundable fee, as well as additional payments dependent upon the achievement of specific milestones. In total, we received non-refundable fees in November and December 2005 of $630,000, which were recorded as deferred revenue at December 31, 2005 and were recognized over the term of the agreements. We have the right to terminate the August 2002 agreement because Merial did not obtain regulatory approval by June 2005. Regulatory approval was received in December 2006. The August 2002 and March 2004 agreements may be terminated by Merial for any reason and all of the agreements may be terminated by either party for failure to meet contractual obligations and for bankruptcy. In May 2006, we signed an additional agreement with Merial to deliver a modified Vitajet 3 for delivery of one of their proprietary vaccines for use in the companion animal market. The agreement provides for milestone payments and delivery of a specified number of devices and disposables through 2008. The agreement may be terminated by either party with a 30-day written notice for a material breach of the agreement by the other. Merial may also terminate this agreement if we do not demonstrate to Merials reasonable satisfaction the reliability and efficacy of the devices. If we have not entered into a mutually agreed upon development agreement by June 1, 2007, which includes appropriate milestone payments for the next generation Vetjet, we will have the right to terminate this agreement. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement upon either party becoming insolvent or upon bankruptcy. This product was delivered to Merial in March 2007. Revenue on these arrangements has been recognized on the percentage of completion method over the development period as costs are incurred with a limitation based on cash payments received to date and receivables for milestones achieved. We are also entitled to receive royalty payments on Merials vaccine sales, if and when they occur, which utilize the needle-free injector systems. Any additional indications or drugs will have separately negotiated terms. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, total deferred revenue related to Merial was $45,000 and $630,000, respectively. We recognized product and development revenue of $1.8 million, $3.7 million and $2.0 million pursuant to these agreements in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 3 Agreement with Japanese Pharmaceutical Company In October 2004, we entered into a license agreement with a leading Japanese pharmaceutical company whereby our Iject® product was to be utilized to administer an undisclosed drug exclusively in Japan. Terms of the agreement included an upfront license fee, which was to be recognized over the ten-year term of the agreement. In July 2006, the agreement was terminated with provisions for right of first refusal for certain indications in Japan. Revenue recognized upon the termination was $268,000 in 2006. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, deferred revenue related to this agreement was $0 and $302,000, respectively, and we recognized revenue of $302,000, $34,000 and $6,000 pursuant to this agreement in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Agreement with European Biotechnology Company In July 2005, we entered into a development agreement with a leading European biotechnology company under which we will develop a new needle-free drug delivery system utilizing our B2000 technology exclusively for an undisclosed indication. We received an up-front development fee of $550,000, with an additional $200,000 to be received upon meeting acceptance criteria as specified in the agreement. In addition, we will receive product development and regulatory milestone payments of approximately $3.5 to $4.0 million over a two year period if the milestones stated in the agreement are met. We expect to meet these milestones in the second quarter of 2007. The agreement also provides for transfer pricing and royalty payments upon commercialization of the product, which is currently expected in 2008. In October 2006, we amended the agreement for additional services to be provided by March 2007. The agreement calls for an upfront payment of $500,000, which was received in October 2006, and progress payments in February and March 2007 totaling $250,000. We received the February payment and expect to receive the March payment in the second quarter of 2007. The agreement may be terminated by either party with a 30-day written notice for a material breach of the agreement by the other. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, deferred revenue related to this agreement was $365,000 and $438,000, respectively, and we recognized revenue of $773,000 and $112,000, respectively pursuant to this agreement in 2006 and 2005. Agreement with an Undisclosed Pharmaceutical Company In December 2005, we entered into a feasibility study, option and license agreement with an undisclosed pharmaceutical company to design and develop a reliable, cost-effective, pre-filled disposable version of our Iject® device. The pharmaceutical company will have an exclusive license for the product for certain indications for a specified time period. We received an up-front non-refundable development fee of $500,000 in December 2005, which will be recognized on the percentage of completion method. In October 2006, we entered into a Concept Phase I agreement and received an upfront, non-refundable fee of $500,000. Concept Phase II is currently being negotiated. The agreement also provides for up to $3.75 million to be received in the development phase of the agreement and $3.0 million for the pilot phase. We will also be reimbursed for certain capital expenditures required in the development phase and pilot phase. The pharmaceutical company may terminate this agreement for any reason upon 30 days written notice. We may immediately terminate this agreement if work under the project is interrupted for 10 consecutive months due to reasons within the pharmaceutical companys reasonable control. Our termination right terminates once project approval for the development phase of the project has been received. Either party has the right to terminate this agreement upon the other party becoming insolvent or upon filing for voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy protection. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, deferred revenue related to this agreement was $405,000 and $500,000, respectively. Revenue recognized pursuant to this agreement in 2006 and 2005 was $595,000 and $0, respectively. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In October 2005, we received a Small Business Innovation Research Grant (SBIR) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the Phase I development of a single-dose injection delivery system. Terms of the agreement include progress billings 4 over the six-month term and is offset against project costs. In October 2006, we received a Phase II SBIR contract from the CDC for further development of a Disposable Cartridge Jet Injection device for safer, needle-free global immunizations. This Phase II funding is for a two-year period for improvements in product design and the continued development of a spring-powered prototype, which was designed and built in Phase I. At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, we did not have any deferred revenue related to these agreements. Revenue recognized pursuant to these agreements in 2006 was $32,000. In addition, we were reimbursed for $68,000 of expenses incurred. Program for Appropriate Technology in Health In October 2005, we entered into an agreement with Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) for the development of technology to create a needle-free injector that is small, efficient, safe, cost effective and appropriate for immunization programs in developing countries. Pursuant to the agreement, PATH paid us a non-refundable up-front fee of $100,000 in October 2005, all of which was included as a component of other current liabilities at December 31, 2005 and was offset against related expenses over the first stage of the agreement through October 2006. We are also directly funding a portion of this project. In addition, we received an additional $150,000 as stage one milestones were met in October 2006. Fees will be negotiated separately for further stages of the agreement. This agreement may be terminated by either party for breach of the material terms of the agreement by the other. Either party may terminate this agreement for insolvency or bankruptcy of the other. The agreement can also be terminated by either party at any time after the commencement of the second stage for any reason, by providing at least 60-days notice to the other. Vical Inc. In November 2006, we entered into an agreement with Vical Inc. for an option to license Biojects needle-free technology for use with certain of Vicals DNA-based vaccines. The agreement includes the payment of an upfront fee to Bioject, payments to extend the option term and license additional targets, payments upon the achievement of specific milestones, commercialization terms, transfer pricing and royalties. The agreement may be terminated by either party for breach of any material provision in the agreement by the other party if not cured within sixty days. Vical may also terminate this Agreement at any time upon sixty (60) days written notice to Bioject. At December 31, 2006 deferred revenue related to this agreement was $115,000. Revenue recognized pursuant to the agreement in 2006 was $10,000. We are actively pursuing additional strategic partnering relationships with a number of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Supply Agreements In addition to agreements with Serono and Merial as described above, we currently have significant supply agreements or commitments with Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc., Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Trimeris Inc., Amgen Inc. and BioScrip Inc. Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc. We had a 30-month agreement with Ferring for Vial Adapters for use with one of its drugs, which expired in January 2007, with Ferring having the ability to extend the agreement for two consecutive 12-month periods. While this agreement has not been extended at this time, we continue to receive firm purchase orders from Ferring. Revenue recognized pursuant to this agreement totaled $1.0 million, $428,000 and $144,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Trimeris Inc. In June 2005, we entered into a letter agreement with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Trimeris Inc. to begin production of B2000® devices ahead of a formal supply agreement. In connection with the letter agreement, we received advances totaling $238,000 for the manufacture of the B2000® devices. The $238,000 was recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt. At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, $238,000 was included as a component of deferred revenue. We 5 anticipate offsetting the deferred revenue against future product sales. No revenue was recognized pursuant to this letter agreement in 2006 and 2005. We anticipate entering into a supply agreement with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Trimeris Inc. by the fourth quarter of 2007. Amgen Inc. We had a two-year agreement with Amgen for Vial Adapters for use with one of its drugs. This agreement, which expired in March 2005, was extended to July 2006. While we do not have a current agreement with Amgen, we continue to receive firm purchase orders from it. We recognized revenue of $2.0 million, $2.6 million and $2.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, pursuant to this agreement. BioScrip Inc. (formerly Chronimed Inc.) We had a one-year supply agreement with BioScrip Inc. for B2000® devices and syringes, which expired December 31, 2005. While we do not have a current agreement with BioScrip Inc., we continue to receive purchase orders for our B2000® devices and syringes from BioScrip Inc. Revenue recognized related to BioScrip totaled $777,000 and $645,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition to the above agreements and commitments, we sell our needle-free injection system, the Biojector® 2000, or B-2000, directly to healthcare professionals, which allows clinicians to inject medications through the skin, both intramuscularly and subcutaneously, without a needle. Currently, our Biojector® 2000 is being utilized by the National Institutes of Health in human trials of vaccines for HIV and the Ebola virus. We also directly market the Vitajet®, a spring-powered, needle-free, self-injection device, which has regulatory clearance for administering injections of insulin, to the home user.

Needle-Free Injection Medications are currently delivered using various methods, each of which has both advantages and limitations. The most commonly used drug delivery techniques include oral ingestion, intravenous infusion, subcutaneous, intradermal and intramuscular injection, inhalation and transdermal patch diffusion. Many drugs are effective only when injected. Injections using traditional needle-syringes suffer from many shortcomings, including: (i) the risk of needlestick injuries; (ii) the risk of penetrating a patients vein; and (iii) the patients aversion to needles and discomfort. The most dangerous of these, the contaminated needlestick injury, occurs when a needle that has been exposed to a patients blood accidentally penetrates a healthcare workers skin. Contaminated needles can transmit deadly blood-borne pathogens including such viruses as HIV and Hepatitis B. Because of growing awareness in recent years of the danger of blood-borne pathogen transmission, needle safety has become a higher concern for hospitals, healthcare professionals and their patients. As a result, pressure on the healthcare industry to eliminate the risk of contaminated needlestick injuries has increased. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued regulations, effective in 1992, which require healthcare institutions to treat all blood and other body fluids as infectious. These regulations were changed by Congress with passage of the Needlestick Safety Prevention Act, which was effective in 2001. These regulations require implementing engineering and work practice controls to isolate or remove blood-borne pathogen hazards from the workplace. Among the required controls are special handling and disposal of contaminated sharps in biohazardous sharps containers, safer medical devices, including needleless systems, and follow-up testing for victims of needlestick injuries. To date, 34 states and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration have adopted, or have pending, legislation or regulations that require health care providers to utilize systems designed to reduce the risk of needlestick injuries. The costs resulting from needlestick injuries vary widely. Accidental needlesticks involving sterile needles involve relatively little cost. Needlesticks with contaminated needles require investigation and follow-up. These are much more expensive. Investigation typically includes identifying the source of contamination, testing the source for blood-borne pathogens and repeatedly testing the needlestick victim for infection over an extended period. Some healthcare providers are requiring additional measures, including treating all needlestick injuries as contaminated unless proven otherwise. In an effort to protect healthcare workers from needlestick injuries, many healthcare facilities have adopted more expensive, alternative technologies. While these technologies can help to reduce accidental needlesticks, they cannot eliminate the risk. Description of Our Products Biojector® 2000 Our Biojector® 2000 system (B-2000) consists of two components: a hand-held, reusable jet injector and a sterile, single-use, disposable plastic syringe capable of delivering variable doses of medication up to 1.0 mL. The B-2000 system is a refinement of jet injection technology that enables healthcare professionals to reliably deliver measured variable doses of medication through the skin, either intramuscularly or subcutaneously, without a needle. The first component of the system, the Biojector® 2000, is a portable hand-held device, which is approximately the size of a flashlight. It is designed both for ease of use by healthcare professionals, as 8 well as to be attractive and non-threatening to patients. The Biojector® 2000 injector uses disposable CO2 cartridges as a power source. The CO2 cartridges, which are purchased from an outside supplier, give an average of ten injections before requiring replacement. The CO2 gas provides consistent, reliable pressure on the plunger of the disposable syringe, thereby propelling the medication into the tissue. The CO2 propellant does not come into contact with either the patient or the medication. The B-2000 is also available with a tank adapter which allows the device to be attached to a large volume CO2 tank. The tank adapter eliminates the need to change CO2 cartridges after every ten injections and is an attractive option for applications where a large number of injections are given in a relatively short period of time. The second component of the system, the Biojector® single-use disposable syringe, is provided in a sterile, peel-open package and consists of a plastic, needle-free, variable dose syringe, Drug Reconstitution System (DRS or Vial Adapter) needle-free syringe filling device, which is used to fill the syringe, and a safety cap. If requested by a customer, the product can also be supplied with a needle which is used as an alternative to the Vial Adapter for filling the syringe. The body of the syringe is transparent and has graduated markings to aid accurate filling by healthcare workers. There are five different Biojector® syringes, each of which is intended for a different injection depth or body type. The syringes are molded using our patented manufacturing process. A trained healthcare worker selects the syringe appropriate for the intended type of injection. One syringe size is for subcutaneous injections, while the others are designed for intramuscular injections, depending on the patients body characteristics and the location of the injection. Giving an injection with a Biojector® 2000 system is easy and straightforward. The healthcare worker giving the injection checks the CO2 pressure on an easy-to-read gauge at the rear of the injector, draws medication up into a disposable plastic syringe using either a needle or the needle-free Vial Adapter, inserts the syringe into the Biojector® 2000, presses the syringe tip against the appropriate disinfected surface on the patients skin, and then presses an actuator, thereby injecting the medication. A thin stream of medication is expelled at high velocity through a precision molded, small diameter orifice in the syringe. The medication is injected at a velocity sufficient to penetrate the skin and force the medication into the tissue at the desired depth. The current suggested retail list price for the Biojector® 2000 professional jet injector is $1,200, and the suggested retail list price for Biojector® syringes is $200 for a box of 100 syringes. CO2 cartridges are sold for a suggested retail price of $8.00 for a box of ten. Discounts are offered for volume purchases. Drug Reconstitution System The needle-free drug reconstitution system allows for the transfer of diluents to reconstitute powdered medications into liquid form and withdrawal of liquid medication into a syringe without the use of a needle. Our 13mm Vial Adapter has a compact, polycarbonate spike design to draw up liquid medication and to reconstitute lyophilized (powdered) medication. It allows healthcare workers and patients to access medication without using a needle. The Vial Adapter fits most single and multi-dose medication vials available in the U.S. and European markets, and is widely used in clinics and home healthcare throughout North America. While the Vial Adapter is an integral part of the needle-free syringe packaging for the Biojector® 2000 needle-free injection system, it functions perfectly with any conventional syringe. Several pharmaceutical manufacturers include this unique product as part of their drug reconstitution kits. The 13mm Vial Adapter is the ideal solution to the challenges of reconstituting and drawing up medication. It provides clinicians and patients the highest levels of safety, convenience and ease of use. The suggested retail price for the Vial Adapter is $125.00 for a box of 400. Discounts are offered for volume purchases. Vitajet® The Vitajet® is also composed of two components, a portable injector unit and a disposable syringe. It is smaller and lower in cost than other products in our needle-free offering. The method of operation and drug delivery is similar to the Biojector®, except that the Vitajet® is powered by a spring rather than by CO2. 9 Due to its ease of use and lower cost, it is a good solution for home-use self-injection. Vitajets® regulatory labeling limits its use to the injection of Insulin. A modified Vitajet®, called the cool.click, has received regulatory clearance for injection of Seronos human growth hormone Saizen® and another modified Vitajet®, called the SeroJet, has regulatory clearance for administering the Serono human growth hormone Serostim® for the treatment of AIDS wasting. The Vetjet is a modified Vitajet® for use in the veterinary market and is licensed to Merial. We believe that the Vitajet® has the potential to achieve regulatory labeling for additional subcutaneous injections. The current suggested retail price for the Vitajet® needle-free injector is $250. A three month supply (13-count) of Vitajet® syringes is sold for a suggested retail price of $60. We have other products under development, which are intended to address other markets or to enhance the Biojector® 2000 system. See Research and Product Development. Marketing and Competition The traditional needle-syringe is currently the primary method for administering intramuscular and subcutaneous injections. During the last 20 years, there have been many attempts to develop portable one-shot jet injection hypodermic devices. Problems have arisen in the attempts to develop such devices including: (i) inadequate injection power; (ii) little or no control of pressure and depth of penetration; (iii) complexity of design, with related difficulties in cost and performance; (iv) difficulties in use, including filling and cleaning; and (v) the necessity for sterilization between uses. In recent years, several spring-driven, needle-free injectors have been developed and marketed, primarily for injecting Insulin. We believe that market acceptance of these devices has been limited due to a combination of the cost of the devices coupled with the difficulties of their use. Also in recent years, various versions of a safety syringe have been designed and marketed. Most versions of the safety syringe generally involve a standard or modified needle-syringe with a plastic guard or sheath surrounding the needle. Such covering is usually retracted or removed in order to give an injection. The intent of the safety syringe is to reduce or eliminate needlestick injuries. However, while the safety syringe is in use and before the needle has been covered, a safety syringe still poses a risk of needlestick injury. Additionally, some safety syringes require manipulation after injection and pose the risk of needlestick injury during that manipulation. Safety syringes are also often bulky and add to contaminated waste disposal costs. Our primary sales and marketing objective is to form development, licensing and supply arrangements with leading pharmaceutical, biotechnology and veterinary companies, which would ordinarily include some or all of the following components: i) licensing revenues for full or partially exclusive access to our products for a specific application or medical indication; ii) development fees if we customize one of our products for the customer or develop a new product; iii) milestone payments related to the customers progress in developing products to be used in conjunction with our products; iv) royalty revenue derived from strategic partners drug sales; and v) product revenues from the sale of our products to the customer pursuant to a supply agreement. Product sales through this channel would ordinarily be made to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, whose sales force would then sell that companys injectable pharmaceutical products, along with our products, to end-users. We have one Vice President of Business Development whose primary focus is to identify companies and drugs that fit our targeted profile. We intend to focus the direct sales efforts of our needle-free injection systems on the military and public health markets. To implement our direct sales and marketing efforts, we currently employ a Strategic Accounts Manager, one customer service representative and four part-time nurse trainers. Our direct sales efforts have resulted in the signing of renewable supply agreements with the State of Alaska, the County of San Francisco and Anne Arundel County (MD). We have also entered into a five-year Federal Supply Schedule purchasing agreement through the Veterans Administration, valid through March 2007. 10 This contract authorizes direct sales to all branches of the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Public Health Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Selling to new customers in our target markets is often a lengthy process. A new customer is typically adopting our products as a new technology. Accordingly, the purchase approval process usually involves a lengthy product evaluation process, including testing and approval by several individuals or committees within the potential customers organization and a thorough cost-benefit analysis. The medical equipment market is highly competitive, and competition is likely to intensify. Many of our existing and potential competitors have been in business longer than us and have substantially greater technical, financial, marketing, sales and customer support resources. We believe that the primary competition for the Biojector® 2000 system, and other needle-free jet injection systems we may develop, is the traditional, disposable needle-syringe and the safety syringe. Leading suppliers of needle-syringes and safety syringes include: Becton-Dickinson & Co., Sherwood Medical Co., a subsidiary of American Home Products Corp., and Terumo Corp. of Japan. Manufacturers of traditional needle-syringes compete primarily on price, which generally ranges from approximately $0.05 to $0.28 per unit. Manufacturers of safety syringes compete on features, quality and price. Safety syringes generally are priced in a range of $0.30 to $0.50 per unit. The average price per injection with the B-2000 is approximately $0.88 to $1.50. We expect to compete with traditional needle-syringes and safety syringes based on issues of healthcare worker safety, ease of use, reduced cost of disposal, patient comfort, and reduced cost of compliance with OSHA regulations and other legislation. Except in the case of certain safety syringes, we do not expect to compete with needle-syringes based on purchase cost alone. However, we believe that the B-2000 system will compete effectively based on overall cost when all indirect costs, including disposal of syringes and testing, treatment and workers compensation expenses related to needlestick injuries, are considered. We believe that we are the only company that has a product like the B-2000 product cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to give both subcutaneous and intramuscular injections up to 1.0 mL. Several companies are developing devices that will likely compete with our jet injection products for certain applications, but to date, none have obtained U.S. marketing regulatory clearance for both subcutaneous and intramuscular indications. We are not aware of any current competing products with U.S. regulatory approval that have total features and benefits comparable to the B-2000 system. We are aware of other portable, needle-free injectors currently on the market, which are generally focused on subcutaneous self-injection applications of 0.5 mL or less. These products include: the Medi-Jector Vision®, which is manufactured by Antares Pharma; and the mhi-500, which is manufactured by The Medical House. These products compete primarily with the Vitajet®. Current list prices for such injectors range from approximately $236 to $665 per injector.

Patents and Proprietary Rights We believe that the technology incorporated in our currently marketed Biojector® 2000 and Vitajet® devices and single-dose disposable plastic syringes, as well as the technology of products under development, give us advantages over both the manufacturers of competing needle-free jet injection systems and over prospective competitors seeking to develop similar systems. We attempt to protect our technology through a combination of patents, trade secrets and confidentiality agreements and practices. Patent Summary Table Trademark Summary Table Item Issued Pending Total Item Issued Pending Total U.S.A. Patents 41 15 56 U.S.A. Trademarks 6 1 7 Foreign Patents 17 21 38 Foreign Trademarks 8 3 11 Total 58 36 94 Total 14 4 18 Our patents expire between 2007 and 2024. Patent applications have been filed on matters specifically related to single use, disposable devices currently under development. We generally file patent applications in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan at the times and under the circumstances that we deem filing to be appropriate in each of those jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that any patents applied for will be granted or that patents held by us will be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide a significant competitive advantage. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, suppliers and others. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to, or be developed independently by, competitors. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to our technology, including patent rights, to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. We believe that we have independently developed our technology and attempt to assure that our products do not infringe on the proprietary rights of others. However, if infringement of the proprietary rights of others is alleged and proved, there can be no assurance that we could obtain necessary licenses to that technology on terms and conditions that would not have an adverse effect. We are not aware of any asserted claim that the Biojector® 2000, the Vitajet®, the cool.click, the Vetjet, the SeroJet or any product under development violates the proprietary rights of any third party. 12 Government Regulation Our products and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive government regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., the FDA administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and has adopted regulations to administer that Act. These regulations include policies that: i) govern the introduction of new medical devices; ii) require observing certain standards and practices in the manufacture and labeling of medical devices; and iii) require medical device companies to maintain certain records and report device-related deaths, serious injuries and certain malfunctions to the FDA. Our manufacturing facilities and certain of our records are also subject to FDA inspection. The FDA has broad discretion to enforce the FFDCA and related regulations. Noncompliance with the Act or its regulations can result in a variety of regulatory actions including warning letters, product detentions, device alerts or field corrections, voluntary and mandatory recalls, seizures, injunctive actions and civil or criminal penalties. Unless exempted by regulation, the FFDCA provides that medical devices may not be commercially distributed in the U.S. unless they have been cleared by the FDA. The FFDCA provides two basic review procedures for pre-market clearance of medical devices. Certain products qualify for a submission authorized by Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Under Section 510(k), manufacturers provide the FDA with a pre-market notification (510(k) notification) of the manufacturers intent to begin marketing the product. In the 510(k) notification, the manufacturer must establish, among other things, that the product it plans to market is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product. To be substantially equivalent, a proposed product must have the same intended use and be determined to be as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. Further, it may not raise questions of safety and effectiveness that are different from those associated with a legally marketed device. Marketing a medical device may commence when the FDA issues correspondence finding substantial equivalence to such a legally marketed device. The FDA may require, in connection with the 510(k) submission, that it be provided with animal and/or human clinical test results. If a medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) procedure, the manufacturer must file a pre-market approval application (PMA). A PMA must show that the device is safe and effective and is generally a much more comprehensive submission than a 510(k) notification. A PMA typically requires more extensive testing before filing with the FDA and a longer FDA review process. A 510(k) notification is required when a device is being introduced into the market for the first time, when the manufacturer makes a change or modification to an already marketed device that could significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness, and when there is a major change or modification in the intended use of the device. When any change or modification is made in a device or its intended use, the manufacturer is expected to make the initial determination as to whether the change or modification is of a kind that would require filing a new 510(k) notification. FDA regulations provide only limited guidance in making this determination. We are developing the Iject® Needle-Free Injection System, a single prefilled disposable injector for self injection, and pre-filled Biojector® syringes. We plan to seek arrangements with pharmaceutical and biologics companies that will enable them to provide medications in pre-filled syringes packaged with the injector device. See Research and Product Development. Before pre-filled Iject® or Biojector® syringes may be distributed for use in the U.S., the FDA may require tests to prove that the medication will retain its chemical and pharmacological properties when stored in and delivered using a pre-filled needle-free syringe. It will be the pharmaceutical or biotechnology companys responsibility to conduct these clinical tests. It is current FDA policy that such pre-filled syringes are evaluated by the FDA by submitting a Request for Designation (RFD) to the Office of Combination Products, (OCP). The pharmaceutical or biotechnology company will be responsible for the submission to the OCP. A pre-filled syringe meets the FDAs definition of a combination product, or a product comprised of two or more regulated components, i.e. drug/device. The OCP will assign a center with primary jurisdiction for a combination product (CDER, CBER, CDRH) and ensure the timely and effective premarket review. The primary or lead review center often will consult or collaborate with other evaluation centers to obtain all the appropriate materials and requirements to process the submission. 13 We believe that if a drug intended to be used in one of our pre-filled syringes was already the subject of an approved new drug application (NDA) or an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for intramuscular, subcutaneous or intradermal injection, then the main issues affecting clearance for use in the pre-filled syringe would be: i) the ability of the syringe to store the drug; ii) the ability of the manufacturer to assure the drugs stability until used; and iii) the ability to demonstrate that the needle-free syringe will perform equivalently to a needle and syringe, or is safe and efficacious in its own right. FDA recommends pre-submission discussions with the OCP to clarify submission requirements. An early Request for Designation can avoid costly delays as the primary requirements and the premarket route (510(k), PMA, NDA) will be determined. The FDA also regulates and monitors our quality assurance and manufacturing practices. The FDA requires us and our contract manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Regulations. These regulations require, among other things, that: i) the manufacturing process be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures; and ii) the ability to produce devices which meet the manufacturers specifications be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every aspect of the process. GMPs also require investigating any deficiencies in the manufacturing process or in the products produced and detailed record-keeping. The FDAs interpretation and enforcement of these requirements has been increasingly strict and will likely continue to be at least as strict in the future. Failure to adhere to GMP requirements would cause the products produced by us to be considered in violation of the FFDCA and subject to enforcement action. The FDA monitors compliance with these requirements by requiring manufacturers to register their establishments with the FDA, and by subjecting their manufacturing facilities to periodic FDA inspections. If the inspector observes conditions that violate the FFDCA or GMP regulations, the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily. Otherwise, the manufacturer may face potential regulatory action, which may include warning letters, product detentions, device alerts or field corrections, voluntary and mandatory recalls, seizures, injunctive actions and civil or criminal penalties. In April 2004, we moved to a larger manufacturing facility and the FDA inspected the facility in August 2004 for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, with no observations or official actions. The FDAs Medical Device Reporting Regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA if any death or serious injury alleged to have been associated with the use of our products occurs. In addition, any product malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to occur must also be reported. FDA regulations prohibit a device from being marketed for unapproved or uncleared indications. If the FDA believes that we are not in compliance with these regulations, it may institute proceedings to detain or seize products, issue a product recall, seek injunctive relief or assess civil and criminal penalties. The use and manufacture of our products are subject to OSHA and other federal, state and local laws and regulations that relate to such matters as: i) safe working conditions for healthcare workers and other employees; ii) manufacturing practices; iii) environmental protection and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances; and iv) the policies of hospitals and clinics relating to complying with these laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws, regulations or policies in the future, or that such laws, regulations or policies will not increase the costs or restrictions related to the use of our products or otherwise have a materially adverse effect upon our ability to do business. Laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices are subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretation. There can be no assurance that future changes in regulations or interpretations made by the FDA, OSHA or other domestic and international regulatory bodies will not adversely affect us. Sales of medical devices outside of the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements. The requirements for obtaining pre-market clearance by a foreign country may differ from those required for FDA clearance. Devices having an effective 510(k) clearance or PMA may be exported without further FDA authorization. FDA authorization is generally required in order to export other medical devices. 14 In June 1998, we first received certification to ISO 9001 and EN 46001 from TŰV Product Services indicating that we have in place a quality system that conforms to International Standards for medical device manufacturers. Our quality system has maintained continuous certification. We recently changed auditors, to Underwriters Laboratories, and migrated our quality system certification to the International Standard ISO 13485:2003. Our quality system is also certified under the Canadian CMDCAS system. In November, 2003 we received Certification from TŰV for compliance with the Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System (CMDCAS), in accordance with the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) standards, and Health Canadas regulatory requirements. In December 2005, when we changed auditors to Underwriters Laboratories, our Canadian certification was upgraded to ISO 13485:2003. We hold Canadian Medical Devices Licenses permitting the importation for sale of Bioject medical devices in Canada. In addition, we have a Medical Device Establishment License with Health Canada. In November 1999, we received certification from TŰV Product Services for the applicable requirements of EC-Directive 93/42/EEC Annex. II.3 Medical Device Directive, (MDD), which allows us to label our products with the CE Mark and sell them in the European Community and various non-European countries. That certification has also been continuously maintained. In February 2006 we passed our most recent MDD re-certification audit. In December 2006, we passed our ISO 13485:2003 and CMDCAS audit. Research and Product Development Research and product development efforts are focused on enhancing our current product offerings and on developing new needle-free injection products. We use clinical magnetic resonance imaging, tissue studies and proprietary in vitro test methods to determine the reliability and performance of new and existing products. As of December 31, 2006 and March 30, 2007, our research and product development staff, including clinical and regulatory staff members, consisted of 12 employees and 8 employees, respectively. Research and development expense totaled $4.5 million, $4.9 million and $7.5 million for years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A primary focus of our current research efforts is on clinical research in the area of DNA-based vaccines and medications. Currently, we believe our devices are being used in more than 12 clinical research projects both within and outside of the United States, nine of which are DNA-based. These research projects are being conducted by companies engaged in the development of DNA-based medications as well as by universities and governmental institutions conducting research in this area. There can be no assurance that further clinical studies will prove conclusively that our technology is more effective in delivering DNA-based medications than alternative delivery systems that are currently available or that may be developed in the future. Developing DNA-based preventative and therapeutic treatments for a variety of diseases is a very active and growing area of medical research. Researchers hope to develop DNA-based treatments for diseases that have previously not been treatable as well as DNA-based alternatives to therapies currently used in the treatment of other diseases. Most DNA therapies currently being developed require injecting the medication either intramuscularly (into the muscle tissue) or intradermally (just under the skin). The Biojector® 2000 is currently the only jet injection device cleared by the FDA for intramuscular injections. We have developed an adapter for the Biojector® syringe to allow the device to consistently deliver intradermal injections. This adapter is being used in clinical studies to deliver intradermal injections. Initial studies show the adapter to be effective. A published trial with the Naval Medical Research Center using a DNA-based malaria vaccine indicated that the adapter consistently delivered intradermal injections. In addition, pre-clinical testing in animals provided consistent data indicating effective intradermal injections. This adapter has not been cleared by the FDA to be marketed for intradermal injections and is not currently submitted to the FDA to gain clearance for those claims. If our jet injection technology is proven to enhance the performance of DNA-based medications, this area of medicine could present a significant opportunity for us to license our products to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in conjunction with their DNA-based medications. There can be no assurance that further clinical studies will 15 prove conclusively that our technology is more effective in delivering DNA-based medications than alternative delivery systems that are either currently available or that may be developed in the future. Further, there can be no assurance, should our technology prove to be more effective in delivering DNA-based medications, that regulatory clearance will be gained to deliver any DNA-based medications using our products. Further, should intradermal delivery of DNA-based medications be critical to effective delivery of those compounds, there is no assurance that we will gain regulatory clearance for intradermal delivery of DNA-based medications with our products. A primary focus of our product development efforts is on developing a new generation of personal injectors (the Iject®) that are small, disposable and lightweight. We anticipate producing a family of Iject® devices, each optimized for the delivery of a specific drug or vaccine, which could be licensed to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for different non-competing products. The Iject® device will be pre-filled to target the growing market for patients administering their own injections in the home. Benefits of the Iject® are: (i) single use, (ii) fully disposable (iii) minimal patient interaction, (iv) ready to use; and (v) safe. In order to support the pre-filled Iject® family of devices, and to expand the market opportunities for the Biojector® 2000, we are developing component processing and packaging methods to enable standardized, high-speed, automated filling of Iject® and Biojector® syringes. We intend to outsource the sterile filling process to a contract manufacturing partner. When the pre-filled technology is perfected, we intend to seek arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under which those companies will sell their medications pre-packaged in Iject® devices or Biojector syringes. Purchasing Iject® devices or Biojector® syringes already filled with medication eliminates the filling and measuring procedures associated with traditional injection of medications and with injections administered with the current Biojector® syringe. Before pre-filled syringes may be distributed for use in the U.S., pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies wishing to use these syringes must commit to packaging and distributing their products in the pre-filled syringes and to the time and financial resources necessary to gain regulatory clearance to package and market their products in this manner. This process could be lengthy. In addition, the companies will have to establish that their drugs will remain chemically and pharmacologically stable when packaged and stored in a Biojector® or Iject® pre-filled syringe and that a drug that is packaged, stored and delivered in this manner is safe and effective for its intended uses. See Governmental Regulation. We are also under contract with several customers to develop custom products suited to specific markets and injectables. This includes a device that will provide multiple injections for a single patient without the need for refilling. Manufacturing We assemble the Biojector® 2000, the Vitajet®, the cool.click, the SeroJet, the Vetjet and related syringes from components purchased from outside suppliers. We believe that we have readily available alternative sources for all of our outside suppliers. There can be no assurance that sufficient numbers of qualified manufacturing employees will be available when needed to increase production to meet either foreseen or unforeseen demand for our products. Further, while we believe that we continue to maintain supplier relationships that will provide a sufficient supply of materials to meet demands at full manufacturing capacity, there can be no assurance that such supplier relationships will be sufficient to meet such demand in quantities and at prices and quality levels required for us to operate efficiently and profitably. Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had 81 full-time employees and one full-time contract manufacturer, with 12 employees engaged in research and product development, one in business development, three in sales and marketing, 59 in manufacturing (including 15 contract manufacturing workers) and six in administration. Following our reduction in force, which occurred in March 2007, we had 68 full-time employees and one full-time contract manufacturer, with 8 employees engaged in research and product 16 development, one in business development, two in sales and marketing, 51 in manufacturing (including 13 contract manufacturing workers) and six in administration. We engage a limited number of part-time consultants who assist with research and development and sales and marketing activities. As of December 31, 2006, we had one consultant and four per diem nurses on contract. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Product Liability We believe that our products reliably inject medications both subcutaneously and intramuscularly when used in accordance with product guidelines. Our current insurance policies provide coverage at least equal to an aggregate of $10 million with respect to certain product liability claims. We have experienced one product liability claim to date, and did not incur a significant liability. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not become subject to more such claims, that our current insurance would cover such claims, or that insurance will continue to be available to us in the future. Our business may be adversely affected by product liability claims. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations. We may need additional funding to support our operations beyond 2007; sufficient funding is subject to conditions and may not be available to us, and the unavailability of funding could adversely affect our business. We believe that as a result of the restructuring we undertook in March 2007 and the new development, licensing and supply agreements we anticipate entering into in 2007, our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated cash expenditures through December 31, 2007. If we are not able to enter into an adequate number of licensing, development and supply agreements by December 31, 2007, we will need to do one or more of the following in order to continue as a going concern: reduce our expenditure run-rate, secure additional long-term debt financing, secure additional equity financing or secure additional short-term financing. There is no guarantee that we will be able to reduce our expenditure run-rate sufficiently or that such resources will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that such resources will be received in a timely manner, if at all. We have a history of losses and may never be profitable. Since our formation in 1985, we have incurred significant annual operating losses and negative cash flow. At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of $113 million and net working capital of $1.4 million. Due to our limited amount of additional committed capital, recurring losses, negative cash flows and accumulated deficit, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm dated April 2, 2007 expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We may never be profitable, which could have a negative effect on our stock price, our business and our ability to continue operations. Our revenues are derived from licensing and technology fees and from product sales. We sell our products to strategic partners, who market our products under their brand name and to end-users such as public health clinics for vaccinations and nursing organizations for flu immunizations. We have not attained profitability at these sales levels. We may never be able to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability. In the future, we are likely to require substantial additional financing. Such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Any future equity financing could result in significant dilution to shareholders. If our products are not accepted by the market, our business could fail. Our success will depend on market acceptance of our needle-free injection drug delivery systems, the Biojector® 2000 system and the Vitajet® system and on market acceptance of other products under development. If our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business could fail. Currently, the dominant technology used for intramuscular and subcutaneous injections is the hollow-needle syringe, which has a cost per injection that is significantly lower than that of our products. The Biojector® 2000, the Iject® system, the Vitajet® 17 system or any of our products under development may be unable to compete successfully with needle-syringes. We may be unable to enter into additional strategic corporate licensing and distribution agreements or maintain existing agreements, which could cause our business to suffer. A key component of our sales and marketing strategy is to enter into licensing and supply arrangements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for whose products our technology provides either increased medical effectiveness or a higher degree of market acceptance. If we cannot enter into these agreements on terms favorable to us or at all, our business may suffer. In prior years, several agreements, including those with Hoffman La Roche Pharmaceuticals, Merck & Co. and Amgen, have been canceled by our partners prior to completion. These agreements were canceled for various reasons, including costs related to obtaining regulatory approval, unsuccessful pre-clinical vaccine studies, changes in vaccine development and changes in business development strategies. These agreements resulted in significant short-term revenue. However, none of these agreements developed into the long-term revenue stream anticipated by our strategic partnering strategy. No revenue resulted from any of the canceled agreements in 2006, 2005 or 2004. We may be unable to enter into future licensing or supply agreements with major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. Even if we enter into these agreements, they may not result in sustainable long-term revenues which, when combined with revenues from product sales, could be sufficient for us to operate profitably. We must retain qualified personnel in a competitive marketplace, or we may not be able to grow our business. Our success depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management. We may be unable to retain our key employees, namely our management team, or to attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees. John Gandolfo, our Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance, departed Bioject in May 2006 as part of the restructuring we announced in March 2006. On October 18, 2006, Mr. James C. OShea, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer retired effective immediately in his role as Chairman and as of December 31, 2006 in his roles as Director, President and Chief Executive Officer. Although we have implemented workforce reductions, there remains substantial competition for highly skilled employees. Our key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time. If we fail to attract and retain key employees, our business could be harmed. Our operating results could suffer as a result of the retirement of our President and Chief Executive Officer. On October 18, 2006, Mr. James OShea retired as our Chairman effective immediately and as a Director and President and Chief Executive Officer effective December 31, 2006. Mr. Jerald S. Cobbs was appointed our Chairman effective October 18, 2006 and as our Interim President and CEO effective March 8, 2007. We are conducting an executive search for a new permanent chief executive officer. In addition, also effective March 8, 2007, the Board of Directors created an Executive Committee, which will serve the role of our Chief Operating Officer. The Executive Committee is composed of Ms. Christine Farrell and Mr. Richard R. Stout, M.D. Ms. Farrell also serves as our Vice President of Finance and Mr. Stout was promoted, effective March 8, 2007, to serve as our Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. This change in our chief executive officer and the creation of the Executive Committee may be disruptive to our business and negatively impact our operating results and may result in the departure of existing employees or customers. Further, it could take an extended period of time to locate, retain and integrate a new chief executive officer. 18 We may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring activities, and our restructuring activities may not result in the expected benefits, which would negatively impact our future results of operations. In March 2007 and 2006, we restructured our operations, which included reducing the size of our workforce. Despite our restructuring efforts, we cannot assure you that we will achieve all of the operating expense reductions and improvements in operating margins and cash flows currently anticipated from these restructuring activities in the periods contemplated, or at all. Our inability to realize these benefits, and our failure to appropriately structure our business to meet market conditions, could negatively impact our results of operations. As part of our recent restructuring activities, we have reduced the workforce in certain portions of our business. This reduction in staffing levels could require us to forego certain future opportunities due to resource limitations, which could negatively affect our long-term revenues. In addition, these workforce reductions could result in a lack of focus and reduced productivity by remaining employees due to changes in responsibilities or concern about future prospects, which in turn may negatively affect our future revenues. Further, we believe our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Our restructuring activities could negatively affect our ability to attract such personnel as a result of perceived risk of future workforce reductions. We cannot assure you that we will not be required to implement further restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce based on changes in the markets and industries in which we compete or that any future restructuring efforts will be successful. We may not be able to comply with Nasdaq listing requirements, which could result in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. On October 3, 2006, we received a Nasdaq Staff Deficiency Letter stating that we failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(4) because for 30 consecutive business days the bid price of our common stock closed below the minimum $1.00 bid requirement. The letter stated that we will be provided 180 calendar days, or until April 2, 2007, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. Compliance would be regained if at any time prior to April 2, 2007 the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. On November 1, 2006, Nasdaq notified us that we were in compliance with the minimum bid requirement. While we are again in compliance with the minimum bid requirement, our common stock continues to trade near $1.00 and, as a result, we may not be able to maintain compliance. In addition, we may be unable to comply with Nasdaqs other listing standards on an ongoing basis. As a result, our stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, as well as on our ability to raise additional debt or equity resources. The fair value of accounting for derivative liabilities may materially impact the results of our operations in future periods. We recorded derivative liabilities in connection with our convertible debt and equity financing agreements in 2006. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, these derivative liabilities are reported at fair value each reporting period. Changes in the fair value are recorded as a component of earnings. Changes in the value of the derivative liabilities may materially impact results of operations in future periods. We have limited manufacturing experience, and may be unable to produce our products at the unit costs necessary for the products to be competitive in the market, which could cause our financial condition to suffer. We have limited experience manufacturing our products in commercially viable quantities. We have increased our production capacity for the Biojector® 2000 system and the Vitajet® product line through automation of, and changes in, production methods, in order to achieve savings through higher volumes of production. If we are unable to achieve these savings, our results of operations and financial condition could suffer. The current cost per injection of the Biojector® 2000 system and Vitajet® product line is substantially higher than that of traditional needle-syringes, our principal competition. In order to reduce costs, a key element of our business strategy has been to reduce the overall manufacturing cost through automating production and packaging. There can be no assurance that we will achieve sales and manufacturing volumes necessary to realize cost savings from volume production at levels necessary to result in significant unit manufacturing cost reductions. Failure to do so will continue to make competing with needle-syringes on the basis of cost very difficult and will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to successfully manufacture 19 devices at a unit cost that will allow the product to be sold profitably. Failure to do so would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to extensive government regulation and must continue to comply with these regulations or our business could suffer. Our products and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive government regulation in both the U.S. and abroad. If we cannot comply with these regulations, we may be unable to distribute our products, which could cause our business to suffer or fail. In the U.S., the development, manufacture, marketing and promotion of medical devices are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The FFDCA provides that new pre-market notifications under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA are required to be filed when, among other things, there is a major change or modification in the intended use of a device or a change or modification to a legally marketed device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness. A device manufacturer is expected to make the initial determination as to whether the change to its device or its intended use is of a kind that would necessitate the filing of a new 510(k) notification. The FDA may not concur with our determination that our current and future products can be qualified by means of a 510(k) submission or that a new 510(k) notification is not required for such products. Future changes to manufacturing procedures could require that we file a new 510(k) notification. Also, future products, product enhancements or changes, or changes in product use may require clearance under Section 510(k), or they may require FDA pre-market approval (PMA) or other regulatory clearances. PMAs and regulatory clearances other than 510(k) clearance generally involve more extensive prefiling testing than a 510(k) clearance and a longer FDA review process. It is current FDA policy that pre-filled syringes are evaluated by the FDA by submitting a Request for Designation (RFD) to the Office of Combination Products (OCP). The pharmaceutical or biotechnology company with which we partner is responsible for the submission to the OCP. A pre-filled syringe meets the FDAs definition of a combination product, or a product comprised of two or more regulated components, i.e. drug/device. The OCP will assign a center with primary jurisdiction for a combination product (CDER, CDRH) to ensure the timely and effective pre-market review of the product. Depending on the circumstances, drug and combination drug/device regulation can be much more extensive and time consuming than device regulation. FDA regulatory processes are time consuming and expensive. Product applications submitted by us may not be cleared or approved by the FDA. In addition, our products must be manufactured in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, as specified in regulations under the FFDCA. The FDA has broad discretion in enforcing the FFDCA, and noncompliance with the FFDCA could result in a variety of regulatory actions ranging from product detentions, device alerts or field corrections, to mandatory recalls, seizures, injunctive actions and civil or criminal penalties. Sales of our Iject® pre-filled syringe product are dependent on regulatory approval being obtained for the products use with a given drug to treat a specific condition. It is the responsibility of the strategic partner producing the drug to obtain this approval. The failure of a partner to obtain regulatory approval or to comply with government regulations after approval has been received could harm our business. In order for a strategic partner to sell our Iject® pre-filled device for delivery of its drug to treat a specific condition, the partner must first obtain government approval. This process is subject to extensive government regulation both in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, sales of the Iject® product to any strategic partner are dependent on that partners ability to obtain regulatory approval. Accordingly, failure of a partner to obtain that approval could cause our financial results to suffer. In addition, if a partner fails to comply with governmental regulations after initial regulatory approval has been obtained, sales of Iject® product to that partner may cease, which could cause our financial results to suffer. The Iject® is still in development and has not yet been sold commercially. 20 If we cannot meet international product standards, we will be unable to distribute our products outside of the United States, which could cause our business to suffer. Distribution of our products in countries other than the U.S. may be subject to regulation in those countries. Failure to satisfy these regulations would impact our ability to sell our products in these countries and could cause our business to suffer. Bioject has received the following certifications from Underwriters Laboratories or TŰV Product Services that our products and quality systems meet the applicable requirements, which allows us to label our products with the CE Mark and sell them in the European Community and non European countries. Certificate Dated ISO 13485:2003 and CMDCAS (Underwriters Laboratories) December 2006 Annex V of the Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (TUV) Audit February 2006 Annex II, section 3 of the Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (TUV) Audit February 2006 If we are unable to continue to meet the standards of ISO 9001 or CE Mark certification, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause our financial results to suffer. If the healthcare industry limits coverage or reimbursement levels, the acceptance of our products could suffer. The price of our products exceeds the price of needle-syringes and, if coverage or reimbursement levels are reduced, market acceptance of our products could be harmed. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operations of healthcare facilities. During the past several years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increased government regulation of reimbursement rates and capital expenditures. Among other things, third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain or reduce healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and levels of reimbursement for healthcare products and procedures. Because the price of the Biojector® 2000 system and Vitajet® product line exceeds the price of a needle-syringe, cost control policies of third party payers, including government agencies, may adversely affect acceptance and use of the Biojector® 2000 system and Vitajet® product line. We depend on outside suppliers for manufacturing. Our current manufacturing processes for the Biojector® 2000 jet injector and disposable syringes as well as manufacturing processes to produce the Vitajet® consist primarily of assembling component parts supplied by outside suppliers. Some of these components are currently obtained from single sources, with some components requiring significant production lead times. In the past, we have experienced delays in the delivery of certain components. To date, such delays have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. We may experience delays in the future, and these delays could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to manage our growth, our results of operations could suffer. If our products achieve market acceptance or if we are successful in entering into product supply agreements with major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, we expect to experience rapid growth. Such growth would require expanded customer service and support, increased personnel, expanded operational and financial systems, and implementing new and expanded control procedures. We may be unable to attract sufficient qualified personnel or successfully manage expanded operations. As we expand, we may periodically experience constraints that would adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion. Failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to compete in the medical equipment field, which could cause our business to fail. The medical equipment market is highly competitive and competition is likely to intensify. If we cannot compete, our business will fail. Our products compete primarily with traditional needle-syringes, safety syringes and also with other alternative drug delivery systems. In addition, manufacturers of needle-syringes, as well as other companies, may develop new products that compete directly or indirectly with our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in this market. A variety of new technologies (for example, transdermal patches) are being developed as alternatives to 21 injection for drug delivery. While we do not believe such technologies have significantly affected the use of injection for drug delivery to date, there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories as well as substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and customer support resources. We are dependent on a single technology, and if it cannot compete or find market acceptance, our business will suffer. Our strategy has been to focus our development and marketing efforts on our needle-free injection technology. Focus on this single technology leaves us vulnerable to competing products and alternative drug delivery systems. If our technology cannot find market acceptance or cannot compete against other technologies, business will suffer. We perceive that healthcare providers desire to minimize the use of the traditional needle-syringe has stimulated development of a variety of alternative drug delivery systems such as safety syringes, jet injection systems, nasal delivery systems and transdermal diffusion patches. In addition, pharmaceutical companies frequently attempt to develop drugs for oral delivery instead of injection. While we believe that for the foreseeable future there will continue to be a significant need for injections, alternative drug delivery methods may be developed which are preferable to injection. We rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our technology. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and procedures and patents to protect our proprietary technologies. We have been granted a number of patents in the U.S. and several patents in other countries covering certain technology embodied in our current jet injection system and certain manufacturing processes. Additional patent applications are pending in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. The claims contained in any patent application may not be allowed, or any patent or our patents collectively may not provide adequate protection for our products and technology. In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to this technology to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. We believe we have independently developed our technology and attempt to ensure that our products do not infringe the proprietary rights of others. We know of no such infringement claims. If a dispute arises concerning our technology, we could become involved in litigation that might involve substantial cost. Such litigation might also divert substantial management attention away from our operations and into efforts to enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets or know-how or determine the scope of the proprietary rights of others. If a proceeding resulted in adverse findings, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties. We might also be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to manufacture or sell our products. Our ability to manufacture and sell our products might also be adversely affected by other unforeseen factors relating to the proceeding or its outcome. If our products fail or cause harm, we could be subject to substantial product liability, which could cause our business to suffer. Producers of medical devices may face substantial liability for damages in the event of product failure or if it is alleged the product caused harm. We currently maintain product liability insurance and, to date, have experienced one product liability claim. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not be subject to a number of such claims, that our product liability insurance would cover such claims, or that adequate insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms in the future. Our business could be adversely affected by product liability claims or by the cost of insuring against such claims. There are a large number of shares eligible for sale into the public market in the near future, which may reduce the price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur. We have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 520,088 shares of our common stock currently outstanding are eligible for sale without registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, subject to certain conditions of Rule 144. The holder of these shares also has certain demand and piggyback registration rights enabling it to register its shares for sale under the 22 Securities Act. We have registered approximately 20.9 million shares for resale on Form S-3 registration statements, including approximately 2.4 million shares issuable upon exercise of warrants. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we had 661,858 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plan and our employee share purchase plan combined. As of December 31, 2006, options to purchase approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock were outstanding and 972,813 restricted stock units were outstanding and will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time subject to vesting. In connection with the Loan Agreement signed in December 2006, we issued a warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.37 per share. The warrant expires on December 10, 2011. The shares underlying this warrant have not been registered for resale. Our stock price may be highly volatile, which increases the risk of securities litigation. The market for our common stock and for the securities of other early-stage, small market-capitalization companies has been highly volatile in recent years. This increases the risk of securities litigation relating to such volatility. We believe that factors such as quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in financial results, new product introductions by us or our competition, public announcements, changing regulatory environments, sales of common stock by certain existing shareholders, substantial product orders and announcement of licensing or product supply agreements with major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies could contribute to the volatility of the price of our common stock, causing it to fluctuate dramatically. General economic trends such as recessionary cycles and changing interest rates may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control or otherwise influence or control most matters submitted to our shareholders. Certain funds affiliated with Life Sciences Opportunities Fund II (Institutional), L.P. (collectively, the LOF Funds) and its affiliates currently own shares of Series D preferred stock, Series E preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock representing in aggregate approximately 32% of our outstanding voting power (assuming exercise of the warrants). As a result, the LOF Funds and their affiliates have the potential to control matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including a change of control transaction, which could prevent or delay such a transaction.
