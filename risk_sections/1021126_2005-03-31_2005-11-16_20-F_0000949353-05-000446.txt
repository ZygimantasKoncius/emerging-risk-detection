RISK FACTORS. Our operations and assets in greater China are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties. Changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Under its current leadership, the Chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the Chinese government will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice. WE MAY HAVE LIMITED LEGAL RECOURSE UNDER CHINESE LAW IF DISPUTES ARISE UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. The Chinese government has enacted some laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, their experience in implementing, interpreting and enforcing these laws and regulations is limited, and our ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable. Due to our current business operations, we may be subject to the implementations, interpretations and enforcement of China's laws by its courts or governmental agencies in connection with our contracts with third parties. The resolution of any such matters may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the Chinese government, and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination. Any rights we may have to specific performance, or to seek an injunction under Chinese law, in either of these cases, are severely limited, and without a means of recourse by virtue of the Chinese legal system, we may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT WE MUST RESPOND QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO NEW TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS. Our business is highly dependent on our computer and software systems. Our failure to maintain the superiority of our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our future success also depends on our ability to enhance existing services and introduce new services or products to respond to changing technological developments. If we are unable to successfully develop and bring to market new services or products in a timely manner, our competitors' technologies or services may render our products or services noncompetitive or obsolete. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP ACCEPTABLE PRODUCTS AND GENERATE DEMAND FOR SUCH PRODUCTS, ADDITIONAL SERIOUS HARM COULD RESULT TO OUR BUSINESS. We have invested significant resources in developing and marketing our products and services. The demand for, and market acceptance of, our products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty. Our products and services are often considered complex and may involve a new approach to the conduct of business by our customers. As a result, intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of these products and services in order to generate demand. The market for our products and services may never develop as we intend, competitors may develop superior products and services or we may fail to develop acceptable solutions to address new market conditions. Any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 5 OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE INTENDED TO WORK WITHIN COMPLEX BUSINESS PROCESSES. AS SUCH, IMPLEMENTATION OR UPGRADES OF OUR PRODUCTS CAN BE DIFFICULT, TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE, AND CUSTOMERS MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OR UPGRADE OUR PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY OR OTHERWISE ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR PRODUCTS. THIS MAY RESULT IN CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, HARM TO OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE NON-PAYMENT ISSUES. Our products typically must integrate with the many existing computer systems and software programs of our customers. This can be complex, time-consuming and expensive, and may cause delays in the deployment of our products. As a result, some customers may have difficulty or be unable to implement our products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products. Delayed or ineffective implementation or upgrades of our software and services may limit our sales opportunities, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation, or cause non-payment issues. OUR SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN ERRORS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND REPUTATION, ADVERSE PUBLICITY, LOSS OF REVENUES, DELAYS IN MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIVERSION OF DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES AND CLAIMS AGAINST US BY CUSTOMERS. Our software programs may contain errors or "bugs." Although we conduct testing and quality assurance through a release management process, we may not discover bugs until our customers install and use a given product or until the volume of services that a product provides increases. On occasion, we have experienced delays in the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products because of bugs. Errors could result in loss of customers and reputation, adverse publicity, loss of revenues, delays in market acceptance, diversion of development resources and claims against us by customers. BECAUSE OUR PRODUCTS COLLECT AND ANALYZE STORED CUSTOMER INFORMATION, CONCERNS THAT OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF CONSUMERS COULD INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. One of the features of our supply chain management software applications is the ability to develop and maintain profiles of consumers for use by businesses. Typically, these products capture profile information when consumers, business customers and employees visit an Internet web-site and volunteer information in response to survey questions concerning their backgrounds, interests and preferences. Our products augment these profiles over time by collecting usage data. Although our supply chain management products are designed to operate with applications that protect user privacy, privacy concerns nevertheless may cause visitors to resist providing the personal data necessary to support this profiling capability. Any inability to adequately address consumers' privacy concerns could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. IF WE FAIL TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR FACE A CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT BY A THIRD PARTY, WE COULD LOSE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR BE LIABLE FOR SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. However, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. This is particularly true in China where the laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and may not provide us with an effective remedy against piracy. The misappropriation or duplication of our intellectual property could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. Any litigation to defend our intellectual property rights could be time-consuming and costly. There has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry regarding intellectual property rights. As a result, we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement. Although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation or damages, cause product shipment delays or the loss or deferral of sales, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. If we enter into royalty or licensing agreements in settlement of any litigation or claims, these agreements may not be on terms acceptable to us. Unfavorable royalty and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 6 WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE THAT WE INCORPORATE INTO AND INCLUDE WITH OUR PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS. IMPAIRED RELATIONS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES, DEFECTS IN THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE OR THE INABILITY TO ENHANCE THEIR SOFTWARE OVER TIME COULD HARM OUR business. We incorporate and include third-party software into and with our products and solutions. Additionally, we may incorporate and include additional third-party software into and with our products and solutions in future product offerings. The operation of our products could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the development and maintenance of the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to make their software available to us on acceptable terms, to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the software capabilities, or to remain in business. Further, it may be difficult for us to replace any third-party software if a vendor seeks to terminate our license to the software or our ability to license the software to customers. Any impairment in our relationship with these third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS THAT COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS. Our software products generally are used by our customers in mission critical applications where component failures could cause significant damages. To mitigate this exposure, our license agreements typically seek to limit our exposure to product liability claims from our customers. However, these contract provisions may not preclude all potential claims. Additionally, our insurance policies may be inadequate to protect us from all liability that we may face. Product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. As a result, any claim, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
