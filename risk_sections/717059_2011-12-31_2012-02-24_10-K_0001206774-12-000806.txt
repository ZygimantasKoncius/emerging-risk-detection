ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are risks that management believes are specific to our business. This should not be viewed as an all-inclusive list or in any particular order. Future loan losses may exceed our allowance for credit losses. We are subject to credit risk, which is the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans in accordance with their terms. We maintain an allowance for credit losses that represents managements best estimate, as of a particular date, of the probable amount of loan receivables and unfunded commitments that the Bank will be unable to collect. The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our loan portfolio involves difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic forecasts might affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. These matters are inherently uncertain, which may, in turn, impact the reliability of estimates. In addition, if our estimates prove to be inaccurate and economic conditions are significantly less favorable than expected or we experience a rapid change in interest rates, our borrowers ability to repay loans could be adversely affected. Developments of this nature could result in losses in excess of our allowance for credit losses. If we determine that it is appropriate to increase the allowance for credit losses to address changing conditions, we will do so through additional provision for credit losses. Any additional provision for credit losses results in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and regulatory capital position. For more information regarding the Companys allowance for credit losses, see the discussion under the subheading Allowance for Credit Losses and Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7 of this report. A large percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. As a result, we are particularly vulnerable to continued deterioration in the real estate market in our market areas and other effects. Approximately 79% of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. As a result, we are vulnerable to declines in real estate values in the markets in which we operate. We have experienced declining real estate values over the last four years and high levels of net charge-offs and provision for credit losses. While net charge-offs and provision for credit losses have declined, if we experience increases in delinquencies with respect to commercial real estate or other real estate related loans, or continued declines in real estate market values, we would expect increased loan charge-offs and additional provision for credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of our significant concentration in loans secured by real estate, we are particularly vulnerable to such effects. The recession has been particularly severe in the market areas we serve and our results of operations may be adversely affected if the local economies do not improve. Substantially all of our loans and loan opportunities are to businesses and individuals in our markets in Washington and Oregon. As evidenced by the unemployment rate in Oregon, which hovered at or above 10% from January 2009 through 2010 and remained elevated at 8.9% in December 2011, our region has been severely impacted by the same challenges facing the economy nationally and perhaps more so. The region has also experienced severe declines in residential and commercial real estate values. If we experience further deterioration in economic conditions or a prolonged delay in economic recovery in our market areas, we could face the following consequences, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business: the value of assets that serve as collateral for our loans, especially real estate, may decline further; loan delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on loans and other real estate owned properties (OREO) could increase; demand for our products and services may decrease or fail to accelerate; and access to low cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease. Financial services legislation and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our businesses and results of operations. Many of the provisions of Dodd-Frank have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive additional rulemaking by regulatory authorities and multiple additional studies. Dodd-Frank, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretations of those rules, could result in a number of adverse impacts on us. The levels of capital and liquidity with which Bancorp and the Bank must maintain to operate may be increased, resulting in decreased leverage and reduced earnings. We may also be subjected to new and/or higher fees to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC. The Bank may also be subject to additional regulations under the newly established CFPB which has been given broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations. These and other provisions of Dodd-Frank could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider, impose additional costs on us, result in significant loss of revenue, impact the value of assets we hold, or otherwise significantly adversely affect our businesses. 11 Amendments to Regulation E, the FDICs Overdraft Guidance, and any new regulations may impact our customers participation in the Bank’s overdraft service program and our overdraft fee income may be negatively affected. Regulation E requires customers who desire to participate in a regulated banks overdraft service program for ATM and one-time-debit card transactions to affirmatively opt-in to the program. Although the majority of our customers have elected to opt-in to the Banks overdraft program, we are not able to predict future customer behavior or determine whether new customers will elect to opt-in. FDIC Overdraft Guidance that became effective July 2011, requires banks to, among other things, establish an outreach program to customers who excessively overdraw their account and advise them of lower cost alternatives, institute appropriate daily limits on customer costs and consider eliminating overdraft fees for transactions that overdraw an account by a de minimus amount. The CFPB has indicated that it will be reviewing the overdraft practices of financial institutions and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the primary regulator of national banks, has issued a proposed regulation that is more restrictive than Regulation E and the FDICs guidance. Therefore, further regulation regarding overdraft practices is possible. If customers do not elect to participate or remain in our overdraft protection program, an important source of noninterest income will be negatively affected. The Order requires the Bank to mail an opt-in notice to customers to continue participation in the Banks overdraft service program for ATM and one-time-debit card transactions and customer may elect to opt-out or fail to respond. The Order requires the Bank to mail a new opt-in notice to all customers who prior to December 20, 2011, opened a checking account with and affirmatively elected to participate in the Banks overdraft service program for ATM and one-time-debit card transactions. If the customer does not respond within thirty three days from the date of the mailing, then the Bank must remove the customer from participation in the program. The new opt-in notice is being mailed in February 2012, and we do not know how many customers will opt-out or fail to respond. If a substantial number of customers opt-out or fail to respond, there may be a material adverse effect on our non-interest income. Congressional and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on our business. Federal and state legislators and regulators continue to pursue increased regulation of how loans are originated, purchased, and sold, and properties are foreclosed. These legislative and regulatory responses may impact how the Bank conducts business, makes and underwrites loans, and buys and sells loans in secondary markets, or lead to changes in the banking industry, lending markets and secondary markets for loans generally. We are unable to predict whether any legislative or regulatory initiatives will be implemented or what form they will take. Any such actions could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we operate, see the discussion under the subheading Supervision and Regulation included in Item 1 of this report. Significant legal and regulatory actions could subject us to uninsured liabilities, associated reputational risk, and reduced revenues. From time to time, we are sued for damages or threatened with lawsuits relating to various aspects of our operations. We may also be subject to investigations and possibly substantial civil money penalties assessed by, or other actions of, federal or state regulators in connection with violations or alleged violations of applicable laws, regulations or standards. We may incur substantial attorney fees and expenses in the process of defending against lawsuits or regulatory actions and our insurance policies may not cover, or cover adequately, the costs of adverse judgments, civil money penalties, and attorney fees and expenses. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and regulatory capital. We are subject to reputational risk, which is the potential that negative publicity regarding our business practices, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base, stock price, or general reputation in the markets in which we operate. Reputational risk is heightened in the instance of publicity surrounding lawsuits or regulatory actions. We are presently subject to regulatory agreements with the primary regulators for Bancorp and the Bank. These agreements restrict our activities and could negatively affect our reputation. Payment systems revenue may be impacted by governmental or payment network action. Effective October 1, 2011, the maximum permissible interchange fee that certain large banks (with more than $10 billion in assets) may charge merchants for various covered debit card transactions was limited by regulation. Even though we are not covered by the regulation, revenue derived from interchange fees may decrease if the Federal Reserve amends its regulations governing the amount of interchange fees. In addition, the payment card networks may change the amount of interchange fees paid to issuers. The Bank is a Visa debit card issuer and derives noninterest income in the form of interchange fees from its debit cards. A decrease in the amount of interchange fees paid to Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 12 Customers may elect to move their accounts to other depository institutions as a result of our new monthly service fees, which may negatively affect our liquidity and fee income. The Bank offers deposit products to its customers, including checking accounts and money market accounts that provide an important source of liquidity and fee income to the Bank. In the first quarter of 2012 the Bank notified customers that it would begin charging a monthly service fee for checking accounts and money market accounts unless minimum balances were maintained. Customer acceptance of these new features is unknown and it is possible that customers will elect to move their account balances to other depository institutions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other financial benefits of our expense reduction initiatives. During 2011 Bancorp and the Bank undertook a number of initiatives to reduce expenses. These initiatives included closing five branches, prepaying certain FHLB debt and restructuring a number of contracts with third party vendors. We may not realize the anticipated cost savings of these initiatives. If we fail to do so, there could be an adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects. Impairment of investment securities could negatively impact our results of operations. At December 31, 2011, our investment securities portfolio included several securities with unrecognized losses, including, among those, four pooled trust preferred securities with a total amortized cost of $13.8 million and a fair market value of $8.0 million. One of these pooled trust preferred securities was considered other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011. For additional detail regarding these securities, see Note 2 Investment Securities to the Companys audited financial consolidated statements included under the section Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Item 8 of this report. We evaluate the securities portfolio, including expected cash values and the value of any collateral, each reporting period as required by generally accepted accounting principles to determine whether a particular security is other-than-temporary impaired. There can be no assurance that we will not recognize one or more impairment charges in future periods with respect to these or other investment securities. The impact of these impairment matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Bancorp is restricted from paying cash dividends on its Common Stock, and these restrictions may continue for a significant period of time. Pursuant to Bancorps Written Agreement with the Reserve Bank and the DFCS, Bancorp is prohibited, without prior consent of the Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve Director and the DFCS, from paying dividends, making payments on its junior subordinated securities, or extending credit or otherwise supplying funds to or engaging in certain transactions with the Bank. Additionally, even if Bancorp obtains regulatory approval to pay dividends on Common Stock, we may not pay any such cash dividends unless we are current on interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with our trust preferred securities. For these and other reasons, Bancorp may not resume paying cash dividends on its Common Stock for some time into the future, if at all. Bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. Substantially all of Bancorps funds and revenue are received as dividends from the Bank, which is currently restricted from paying dividends. The Bank may not pay dividends to Bancorp in the near future. Substantially all of Bancorps funds and revenue are received as dividends paid from the Bank. Pursuant to the MOU the Bank is prohibited from paying dividends to Bancorp without the consent of the FDIC and the DFCS. We do not know when the FDIC and DFCS would consent to a request from the Bank to pay dividends to Bancorp. In the event the Bank continues to be unable to pay dividends to Bancorp, Bancorp may not be able to service debt or pay other obligations. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on Bancorps business, financial condition, including liquidity, and results of operations. During the third quarter of 2009, we began deferring regularly scheduled interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with our trust preferred securities. Under the terms of the junior subordinated debentures and the trust documents, we have the contractual right to defer payments of interest for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods without default. During the deferral period, the respective trusts will likewise suspend the declaration and payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities. If the Company fails to bring the deferred payments current prior to the end of the deferral period, then we may be deemed to be in default under the terms of the debentures and subject to various penalties. Commencing in the second quarter of 2011, the Company, with regulatory approval, paid all previously deferred interest and resumed making interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures. There is no assurance that future regulatory approval to make such interest payments will be granted. 13 Rapidly changing interest rates or prolonged low interest rates could reduce our net interest margin, net interest income, and net income. Interest and fees on loans and investment securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, are the principal source of our revenues and thus a driver an important driver of net income. Interest rates and changes in those influence our net interest margin and are subject to many factors beyond our control. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. It could also lead to decreased demand for loans and other products that are priced based on interest rates. Rapid increases in interest rates could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in financial instrument maturities. Rapid decreases in interest rates could result in interest income decreasing faster than interest expense, for example, if management is unable to match decreases in earning assets yields, with reduced rates paid on deposits or borrowings. Additionally, extended periods of low market interest rates, such as we have today and are likely to continue for the near future based on the Federal Reserves announcements regarding monetary policy, may adversely affect our net interest spread and net interest income because our earning assets yield decreases and stays low during a time that our cost of interest bearing liabilities is already low and cannot be correspondingly reduced further. For more information regarding interest rates, see the discussion under the section Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in the Item 7A of this report. We face liquidity risks in the operation of our business. Liquidity is crucial to the operation of Bancorp and the Bank. Liquidity risk is the potential that Bancorp or the Bank will be unable to fund increases in assets or meet payment obligations, including obligations to the Banks depositors, as they become due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding or liquidate assets at a reasonable cost. Funding illiquidity may arise at the Bank if we are unable to, at reasonable terms, attract and retain deposits, secure or renew borrowings from the overnight inter-bank market, the FHLB, or the Federal Reserve discount window, or access other sources of liquidity, as described in more detail under the heading Liquidity and Sources of Funds in Item 7 of this report. Changes or disruptions to the FHLB system could adversely impact our ability to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. If we fail to monitor and control our liquidity risks, there may be materially adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. We face operational risks that may result in unexpected losses. We face various operational risks that arise from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, failures in internal controls, breaches of our security systems, fraud, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, or any number of other unforeseen events could result in unexpected losses. Additionally, third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access, data reporting, and data processing. Any problems caused by third parties could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and our revenues, expenses, and earnings. Replacing third party vendors, should that be necessary, may entail significant delay and expense. Our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security. The Bank relies on its computer information systems in the conduct of its business. The Bank has policies and procedures in place to protect against and reduce the occurrences of failures, interruptions, or breaches of security of these systems, however, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will eliminate the occurrence of failures, interruptions or breaches of security or that they will adequately restore or minimize any such events. The occurrence of a failure, interruption or breach of security of the Bank's computer information systems could result in a loss of information, business or regulatory scrutiny, or other events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The financial services industry is very competitive and failure to develop, implement, and distribute competitive products to generate profitable revenue sources or to implement expense reduction initiatives, while maintaining revenues and efficiencies, could affect our net income. We face competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans and providing other financial services. Our competitors include other community banks, larger banking institutions, and a wide range of other financial institutions, such as credit unions, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies and other non-bank businesses. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than us. The challenging real estate market conditions and modest loan demand over the past few years have caused intense pricing pressures for loans to qualified borrowers, which impacts spreads we obtain on loans. For a more complete discussion of our competitive environment, see the discussion under the heading Competition included in Item 1 of this report. If we are unable to compete effectively, we will lose market share, and income from loans and other products may be reduced. Inability to hire or retain key professionals, management and staff could adversely affect our revenues and net income. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including, but not limited to, major revenue generating functions such as our loan and deposit portfolios. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues and earnings. 14 Market and other constraints on our loan origination volumes may lead to continued pressure on our interest and fee income. Due to the continued weak economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and other factors, we expect continued pressure on new loan origination volumes in the near term, particularly with respect to construction loans, relative to such volumes generated in the pre-recession period. If we are unable to increase loan volumes, there will be continued pressure on our interest income and fees generated from our lending operations. Unless we are able to offset the lower interest income and fees with increased activity in other areas of our operations, our total revenues may decline relative to our total noninterest expenses. We expect that it may be difficult to find new revenue sources in the near term. Our products and services are delivered on a technological platform that is subject to rapid change and transformation. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change and we face constant evolution of customer demand for technology-driven financial and banking products and services. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvement and product development, marketing, and implementation. Any failure to successfully keep pace with and fund technological innovation in the markets in which we compete could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our Common Stock trades in relatively limited volumes and a significant percentage continues to be owned by investors in the October 2009 private capital raise, which may result in a share price that is volatile and which may be subject to downward pricing pressure in the event significant shareholders decide to dispose of shares of our Common Stock. Our Common Stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol WCBO" and trading volume is modest. The limited trading market for our Common Stock may lead to exaggerated fluctuations in market prices and possible market inefficiencies, as compared to a more actively traded stock. It may also make it more difficult to dispose of our shares at expected prices, especially for holders seeking to dispose of a large number of our shares. In addition, if a large shareholder or group of investors in our private capital raise elects to sell their shares, such sales or attempted sales could result in significant downward pressure on the market price of our Common Stock and actual price declines. Natural disasters could affect our ability to operate. Our market areas are located in earthquake zones and our coastal markets are located in areas that are susceptible to tsunamis. Natural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our market areas and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by future earthquakes or tsunamis will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas, but such events could result in an inability to continue business operations or cause a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses. 15 ITEM 1B.
