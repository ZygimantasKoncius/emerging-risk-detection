Risk FactorsThe Groups results of operations and financial condition could be harmed by changes in exchange rates. In 2006, approximately 52% of the Groups net sales (49% in 2005) and 40% of the Groups trading operating income (40% in 2005) were outside the euro zone and therefore subject to exchange rate risk. 2005 2006 In millions of euro As a % of Group figures In millions of euro As a % of Group figures Net sales: of subsidiaries located in euro zone 6,642 51 % 6,755 48 % of subsidiaries located outside euro zone 6,382 49 % 7,318 52 % Group total net sales 13,024 100 % 14,073 100 % Trading operating income: of subsidiaries located in euro zone 1,043 60 % 1,148 60 % of subsidiaries located outside euro zone 695 40 % 766 40 % Group total trading operating income 1,738 100 % 1,914 100 % 56 Table of Contents Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees Directors and Senior Management In accordance with French law governing a société anonyme, a form of limited liability company, the Companys activities are managed by its board of directors, or conseil dadministration, and by its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who has full executive authority to manage the activities of the Company, subject to the prior authorization of the board of directors or of the Companys shareholders for certain decisions specified by law or by the charter of the board of directors. Under French company law, the board of directors may elect one person to assume the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or split these functions between two different persons (either the Chairman of the Board or another natural person bearing the title of Chief Executive Officer or Directeur Général). The Companys bylaws were modified at the extraordinary shareholders meeting of April 25, 2002 to provide for such a choice. According to the Companys bylaws, the choice is made by the board of directors deciding with a majority of all its members. On April 25, 2002, the board of directors decided not to split these two functions, which are currently performed by the same person. French law and the Companys bylaws permit the board of directors to delegate general or specific powers to up to five people (Directeurs Généraux Délégués or Assistant Managing Directors). The Chief Executive Officer proposes the appointment of the Directeurs Généraux Délégués or Assistant Managing Directors to the board of directors and the board of directors determines their specific management powers and responsibilities. Under French law, an Assistant Managing Director, like the Chief Executive Officer, has broad powers to represent and bind the Company in dealings with third parties. An Assistant Managing Director may be removed by the board of directors at any time upon proposal by the Chief Executive Officer. An Assistant Managing Director may be held individually responsible for his/her actions if they are deemed contrary to the Companys interests. Pursuant to the Companys bylaws, in addition to the appointment of Directeurs Généraux Délégués, the board of directors can appoint one or more Vice-Chairmen. The Vice-Chairmans seat comprises no particular powers other than chairing board meetings and general meetings if either the Chairman or the director temporarily acting for the latter, in compliance with law, is absent. In consideration for their services on the board, directors are entitled to receive jetons de présence (directors fees). The total annual amount of jetons de présence is fixed at the shareholders meeting, but the board determines their allocation among the directors. In addition, remuneration may be granted to directors on a case-by-case basis for special assignments. Subject to one exception below, a director may not vote for his or her own remuneration. If he or she does vote, the decision is void. The board may also authorize the reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses as well as other expenses incurred by directors in the corporate interest. The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Assistant Managing Directors are entitled to receive remuneration or other amounts in addition to jetons de présence under certain circumstances. Any additional remuneration is determined by the board of directors and therefore, in this case only, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Assistant Managing Directors may vote on resolutions concerning their remuneration. Board of Directors Under French law, the board of directors prepares and presents yearly financial statements to the shareholders and calls the shareholders meeting. In addition, the board of directors determines the direction of the Companys activities and oversees the implementation of its decisions. Meetings of the board of directors, which are held as often as required by the corporate interest, are normally convened and presided over by the Chairman. According to French company law, if the board of 57 Table of Contents directors has not met for over two months, at least one-third of the members of the board may request that the Chairman convene the board regarding matters listed in the agenda for the meeting. A quorum is at least one-half of the members of the board, and decisions are taken by a vote of the majority of the members present, deemed to be present, or represented by other members of the board of directors. The Companys bylaws permit that certain decisions be taken by the board of directors by means of a conference call or video communication. A director may give a proxy to another director by any written or electronic means, but a director cannot represent more than one other member at any particular meeting. Members of the board of directors represented by another member at meetings do not count for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. A director may not vote for an arrangement or contract in which he or she is interested. If he or she does vote, the decision will be void. Under French law, the board of directors must give prior authorization for any security, pledge or guarantee granted by the Company to secure obligations of third parties. This authorization is generally granted for a period of one year. If the security, pledge or guarantee has not been previously authorized by the board of directors, it shall have no effect with regard to the Company. Pursuant to French law and the Companys bylaws, the board of directors may consist of 3 to 18 directors. The Companys bylaws provide that each director is elected by the shareholders at an ordinary general meeting of shareholders for a three-year term and is eligible for reelection upon expiration of such term. The shareholders meeting of April 11, 2003 passed a resolution increasing the aggregate amount of directors fees to  500,000. Pursuant to the Groups code of business conduct (Principes de Conduite des Affaires du Groupe), directors who are also members of the executive committee do not receive directors fees. In 2006, directors were paid a total of approximately  278,000 in directors fees for their attendance at board meetings. A director who attended all five meetings of the board of directors in 2006 received  20,000 in directors fees, with a fixed portion of  10,000 per year and a variable portion of  2,000 per meeting attended. In addition, the members of the three committees of the board of directors received compensation of  4,000 per meeting. The compensation of the chairmen of these committees is double these amounts. Each director must own at least 2,000 shares of the Company throughout his term of office. In 2006, the board of directors of the Company held five meetings and the attendance rate was approximately 85%. The Companys bylaws provide for the retirement age of the directors. Directors cannot be appointed if they are over 70 years old. The term of such director will automatically terminate at the end of the ordinary general meeting of shareholders held in the year during which the director has reached the age of 70. However, according to the Companys bylaws, the general shareholders meeting may resolve that this age limit shall not apply to one or more directors who remain in office or may be re-appointed, provided the number of directors concerned by this provision does not exceed one-quarter of the directors in office. In addition, according to the Companys bylaws, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer (if applicable) and Assistant Managing Directors may not be more than 65 years old. The French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) strictly forbids loans by the Company to its directors. In addition, no Group company may provide loans to directors or guarantee any directors obligations. This prohibition also applies to specified executive officers, Assistant Managing Directors, permanent representatives of companies on the board of directors, spouses or heirs of such persons, and other intermediaries. The French Commercial Code and the Companys bylaws require any director, the Chief Executive Officer, any Assistant Managing Directors and any of the Companys shareholders holding voting rights greater than 10%, or if a shareholder company, the company controlling it, that are considering, either directly or indirectly, personally or through an intermediary, entering into an agreement with the Company, to inform the Companys board of directors as well as its auditors before the transaction is consummated. French law also requires such an agreement to be authorized by the board of directors, and the director in question or person concerned may not vote on the issue. French law further requires such an agreement to be submitted to an ordinary general meeting of shareholders for approval once entered into, upon presentation of a special report from the Companys auditors. Any agreement entered into in violation of these requirements may be declared void by the Commercial 58 Table of Contents Court at the request of the Company or of any shareholder, if such agreement is contrary to the interests of the Company. However, French law also states that such agreements, if they are entered into in the ordinary course of business and with terms and conditions which are not out of the ordinary, are not subject to the prior authorization of the board of directors. Nevertheless, such agreements must be disclosed by the interested party to the Chairman of the board of directors unless they are not significant for any party in terms of purpose or financial impact. The list and purpose of such agreements must be communicated by the Chairman of the board to the board of directors and to the statutory auditors. Under French law, directors are liable for violations of French legal or regulatory requirements applicable to sociétés anonymes, violation of the bylaws or mismanagement. A director may be held liable for such actions both individually and jointly with other directors.

The Companys board also includes three honorary directors who serve in an advisory role: Daniel Carasso (Honorary Chairman), Yves Boël and Jean-Claude Haas. The Company has implemented a charter, which outlines the rights and responsibilities of directors and the principles governing the conduct of its executive officers. These guidelines were adopted at the directors meeting held on April 25, 2002. In 2003, further to the recommendations of the Nomination Committee and following the Bouton Report, a report issued in France to promote better corporate governance practices for listed companies, the board of directors evaluated its operating practices and decided to modify the charter of the board of directors. Following its evaluation in 2006, a new charter was adopted by the board of directors at its meeting on December 15, 2006. The board of directors applied the recommendations of the Bouton Report to evaluate the independence of the directors according to criteria that are different from those adopted by the New York Stock Exchange. However, the board of directors decided to progressively implement the recommendation of the Bouton Report relating to directors who have served as such for over 12 years and provide for the development of the board accordingly. The board of directors also noted that the roles as directors that Mr. Goblet dAlviella occupies in two companies in which Mr. Franck Riboud was also a director until June 2006 did not affect his independence. As a result of these decisions, the board reviewed the position of each of its directors and qualified seven of the thirteen directors as independent. The Company believes that seven of the thirteen directors are also independent under the independence criteria adopted by the New York Stock Exchange. Significant Differences from NYSE Corporate Governance Requirements Although Groupe Danone, as a foreign private issuer, is exempt from most of the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to U.S. companies, Groupe Danone currently complies with substantially all such corporate governance requirements except that Groupe Danones non-management directors do not currently meet without management and Groupe Danones Nomination and Compensation Committee is not composed wholly of independent directors. Executive Committee Under the authority of Mr. Franck Riboud, the executive officers comprising the executive committee ensure the operational management of the Group. The executive officers implement the strategy defined by the board of directors, approve the budgets, coordinate the planning and execution of the missions of each of the subsidiaries and business lines and, depending on the results achieved, determine action plans to be implemented. The executive officers meet in committee at least once a month. 60 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the names and ages of the executive officers of the Company and their current positions with the Company: Name Age Position Executive Officer Since Franck Riboud 51 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Président Directeur Général) 1996 Jacques Vincent 61 Vice-Chairman and Directeur Général Délégué 1996 Georges Casala 65 Executive Vice-PresidentBiscuits and Cereal Products 2000 Emmanuel Faber 43 Executive Vice-PresidentAsia-Pacific 2000 Antoine Giscard dEstaing 46 Executive Vice-PresidentFinance, Strategy and Information Systems (Chief Financial Officer) 2005 Bernard Hours 50 Executive Vice-PresidentFresh Dairy Products 2001 Philippe Loïc Jacob 42 Secretary General 2005 Thomas Kunz 49 Executive Vice-PresidentBeverages 2004 Franck Mougin 49 Executive Vice-PresidentHuman Resources 2002 Sven Thormahlen 50 Executive Vice-PresidentResearch and Development 2005 Franck Riboud, 51, has been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Président Directeur Général) since 1996.

Directors and Executive Officers Compensation In 2006, the aggregate amount of compensation paid by Danone to its executive officers and directors as a group (19 persons in all) for services in all capacities was  11.4 million, including  11.1 million to executive officers of which  6 million was variable compensation. The aggregate amount paid by Danone for pension, retirement or similar benefits for the same executive officers and directors as a group in respect of the 2006 fiscal year was  0.6 million. Executive officers compensation amounts include a fixed element and a variable element representing between 40% and 60% of total compensation. The variable element is based on economic, social and individual objectives. For all executive officers, the variable element is based on economic objectives, to which is added a qualitative evaluation of the strategy developed over the course of the year. For the Chairman and Vice- 62 Table of Contents Chairman, the variable economic element is calculated with reference to Group objectives, in terms of net sales, trading operating margin, free cash flow and current net earnings per share, as communicated to the financial markets. For executive officers who manage a business line, the variable economic element is based on objectives set in the budget of the business line in terms of net sales, trading operating income, free cash flow and trading operating margin. For the other executive officers, the variable economic element is calculated based on the Groups objectives set in the budget in terms of trading operating margin, current net earnings per share and operating costs. The compensation of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman are determined by the board of directors on the basis of recommendations made by the Nomination and Compensation Committee. The compensation policy for the other members of the executive committee is presented annually to the Nomination and Compensation Committee. In 2005 and 2006, the aggregate amount of compensation for services awarded to the directors was: Compensation and OtherBenefits(1) Name 2005 2006 (in euro) Franck Riboud 2,485,540 2,579,100 Jacques Vincent 1,544,620 1,592,980 Bruno Bonnell 20,000 16,000 Michel David-Weill 32,000 24,000 Emmanuel Faber 966,058 998,084 Richard Goblet dAlviella 54,000 44,000 Hirokatsu Hirano 20,000 16,000 Bernard Hours 941,408 1,364,170 Christian Laubie 54,000 44,000 Jean Laurent 20,000 24,000 Hakan Mogren 16,000 22,000 Jacques Nahmias 22,000 20,000 Benoît Potier 66,000 68,000 (1) Compensation includes gross salary, bonuses, indemnities and directors fees granted by the Company and its subsidiaries for the financial period.

Employees at Groupe Danone benefit from the Groupe Danone standard employment contracts. However, while Franck Riboud and Jacques Vincent hold their positions as Président Directeur Général and Directeur Général Délégué, respectively, their service contracts with the Company are suspended. In the event that either of these two individuals no longer holds his position, his service contract with the Company will be reinstated, (i) taking into account the length of his terms as Président Directeur Général or Directeur Général Délégué, respectively, for purposes of seniority and benefits, (ii) at a position comparable to that currently held in the executive committee and (iii) at an annual level of compensation no less than the average for all the members of the executive committee during the twelve months prior to such reinstatement. Emmanuel Faber and Bernard Hours continue to benefit from their service contracts without interruption. In addition, if Messrs. Riboud and Vincent are removed from their current positions in certain specific circumstances, they will be entitled to a severance payment of two times the compensation (including bonus compensation and benefits) received during the preceding twelve months. A similar provision also applies to Mr. Faber and all members of the executive committee who hold a service contract under French law. Senior managers of the Group who were under the French pension system at December 31, 2003 benefit from a defined benefit pension plan. This plan pays a pension based on years of service and the amount of the last salaries, under the condition that the employee is still with the Group at the time of retirement. The pension is paid after deducting pensions paid by other mandatory plans and may reach a maximum of 65% of the last salary. In the event of retirement before the age of 55 or in the event of death before retirement, the employee loses all 63 Table of Contents benefits under this plan. This pension plan was closed to new participants on December 31, 2003.

At December 31, 2006, the total amount of the Groups pension obligations for directors was  38 million. Committees of the Board of Directors The board of directors has established three committees: the Audit Committee, the Nomination and Compensation Committee and the Social Responsibility Committee, as described below. The administrative organization of the Audit Committee and the Nomination and Compensation Committee differs from that required of U.S. companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Audit Committee In its meeting on December 15, 2006, the board of directors gave the Audit Committee a new charter which outlines its responsibilities.

As of February 28, 2007, the members of the Audit Committee were Benoît Potier (Chairman), Richard Goblet dAlviella and Christian Laubie, who are all independent. 64 Table of Contents Mr. Christian Laubie is the financial expert of the Audit Committee, due to his knowledge of accounting principles, procedures of internal control and the roles of the Audit Committee. Mr. Laubie was the Chief Financial Officer of Danone from 1980 to 2000, and he participates in the organization that regulates statutory audit professionals in France. Nomination and Compensation Committee In 2005, the board of directors decided to merge the Compensation Committee and the Nomination Committee into a single committee called the Nomination and Compensation Committee. In its meeting on December 15, 2006, the board of directors gave the Nomination and Compensation Committee a new charter which outlines its responsibilities. The Nomination and Compensation Committee is responsible for:  making proposals to the board of directors for nominations of directors;  preparing the review by the board of directors of questions relating to management of the Company;  conducting an evaluation of the board of directors and the Audit Committee, upon request;  proposing criteria for the compensation of the executive officers of the Company;  making proposals related to the grant of share purchase options or shares free of charge to the executive officers and directors;  proposing the allocation of attendance fees among directors; and  more generally, making recommendations related to the Groups compensation policy upon the request of the board of directors. In 2006, the committee met once and in particular reviewed in detail all of the compensation programs and benefits for the members of the Executive Committee. After the adoption of its charter by the board of directors in December 2006, the committee met for the first time on January 23, 2007. As of February 28, 2007, the members of the Nomination and Compensation Committee were Mr. Michel David-Weill (Chairman), Mr. Jean Laurent (independent director) and Mr. Hakan Mogren (independent director). Social Responsibility Committee In its meeting on December 15, 2006, the board of directors decided to create a third governance body, the Social Responsibility Committee. In its meeting on February 14, 2007, the board of directors gave this committee a charter which outlines its responsibilities and procedures. The Social Responsibility Committee is responsible for:  reviewing the principal risks and opportunities for the Group in environmental matters in relation to its objectives and activities and with respect to market trends and developing practices in the industry;  reviewing the social policies of the Group, its objectives and the results obtained;  reviewing reporting, evaluation and control systems in order to allow the Group to produce reliable information in non-financial matters;  reviewing the non-financial information published by the Group, in particular relating to social and environmental matters;  reviewing once a year the ratings received by the Company and its subsidiaries by non-financial rating agencies; and 65 Table of Contents  ensuring the application of the ethical codes established by the Group. In addition, in the field of socially responsible investments, the committee is responsible for:  evaluating the impact of these actions for the Company and the Group;  reviewing the application of the rules established by the Group concerning investments and social programs in areas related to the Groups activities; and  ensuring that the Companys interests are preserved, in particular preventing any conflict of interest between these activities and the rest of the activities of the Group. As of February 28, 2007, the members of the Social Responsibility Committee are Mr. Jean Laurent (Chairman and independent director), Mr. Bruno Bonnell (independent director) and Mr. Emmanuel Faber.

Employee Profit Sharing The Companys employees benefit from a triennial profit sharing plan, renewed in 2006, based on the Groups results. In addition, the subsidiaries generally have in place profit sharing plans for their employees based on their own results. In 2006, recorded charges relating to profit sharing plans amounted to  121 million ( 116 million in 2005 and  115 million in 2004). Group Performance Units In 2005, the Group put in place a new system of variable compensation, in the form of Group Danone Performance Units (GPU), for which members of the executive committee and certain managers are eligible, totaling approximately 1,000 people worldwide. The value of the GPUs, which can vary between  0 and  30, is calculated over a sliding period of three years based on the Groups performance measured based on objectives communicated to the financial markets. Each year, the board of directors of the Company, considering the recommendations of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, sets the performance objectives for the next year and evaluates the achievement of the previous years objective for each GPU plan. In the event of a successful tender offer for shares of the Company, the performance objectives of the GPU plans will be considered to have been met and the GPUs will be paid in the month following the completion of the offer. This three-year variable compensation program, based on performance objectives announced to the financial markets, increases the unity and commitment of managers with the objective of strengthening the Groups positions in its markets and improving its operational performance. 68 Table of Contents General Policy Danones corporate culture is based on two goals: economic and social. As a result, the Groups human resources policy is founded on two principles: a full and complete involvement in operating decisions and the determination to meet demanding social commitments. The Direction du Développement Durable et de la Responsabilité Sociale (Management of Sustainable Development and Social Responsibility) coordinates and implements the sustainable development policy, in connection with the various functional departments of the Group and its subsidiaries. Operational decisions are effected by a human resources organization that is simple and close to the needs of the business. Human resources are organized by division and rely on group-wide structures in key areas such as compensation, organization and know-how, integration of acquisitions, recruitment and senior management. As a result, to attract talent from all over the world, the Group has developed an institutional communication campaign presented on the Internet by the website danonepeople.com. The development of human resources is ensured by training and quality management, for example, through tools such as 360° personal assessments and coaching. Furthermore, human resources promotes the Groups international development through (i) a global recruitment policy, (ii) encouraging the movement of managers around the world through a dedicated team that manages the administrative, financial and personal aspects of transfers and rotations and (iii) the integration of newly acquired companies. Social Policy The Groups core principles are based on International Labor Organization conventions relating to the prohibition of child labor, forced labor, discriminatory practices, safety and working conditions, working hours, the application of national laws to the minimum wage, freedom of association and expression of employees and the right to collective bargaining. These principles are minimum requirements to be met by all Group companies, related companies, partners and suppliers. The implementation of a human resource and social policy is only valid insofar as the basic requirements are fulfilled by the employees of the Group and its partners. Safety and Working Conditions. Group policies regarding safety and working conditions apply to all employees, including temporary staff, interns and apprentices, who are all included in statistics, and to all Group companies, whether recently acquired or not. Welfare. The Group has developed a welfare policy in accordance with the economic situation of the environment in which the subsidiaries operate. Welfare takes into account the fundamental needs for social protection of employees and their families. It covers areas as diverse as pensions, workplace accidents, access to medical care and insurance for business travel. Wages. The Groups objective is to be attractive in the countries in which it is present. Wages are a key factor in the Groups human resource policies which offer the continued acquisition of skills and career opportunities. The Groups objective is to better attract and motivate employees, and the Group seeks to be competitive with comparable leading international companies in each country where it operates. Each subsidiary is encouraged to develop a formal compensation policy and to communicate it to managers and management committees. In 2001, the Group introduced a worldwide classification system for all managers, enabling them to identify their precise ranking and related responsibilities. The individual contribution of each manager is evaluated in an annual interview or Development and Performance Review (RDP). In 2006, the Groups personnel expenses, including social expenses, amounted to  1,807 million compared with  1,793 million in 2005 and  1,729 million in 2004. In addition,  121 million was paid to the employees of the Group in 2006 as part of the incentive and profit sharing schemes, compared with  116 million in 2005 and  115 million in 2004. 69 Table of Contents Dialogue with Unions. The topics most often covered in collective bargaining agreements as negotiated with unions or workers representatives are compensation, work hours and conditions and work safety. Since 1996, the Groups Information and Consultation Committee has met once a year and is composed of Group union members and permanent national unions on the one hand and Danone human resources and operational managers on the other. It also has observer members from the International Union of Food Workers (IUF). Regular dialogue has existed since 1985 with the IUF, which has led to the implementation of six common programs since 1988 relating to equal opportunities in the workplace, the availability of economic and social information, the recognition of union rights and informing representatives of the personnel in the event of a modification of the business which may affect jobs and working conditions and the restructuring of the biscuits segment, programs that have been concluded since 1988 by six agreements which were revised in 2005 to facilitate worldwide application. These agreements are widely distributed within the Groups subsidiaries and published in 20 languages in order to be more easily understood and put in place. Training. More than ten years ago, the Company put in place a series of training programs in areas such as purchasing, marketing, human resources and financing that are run by professionals from various companies within the Group with the assistance of outside specialists, in the form of educational partnerships with universities. Leading Social and Environmental Responsibility. In conducting business, the Danone Way is both a business conduct policy and a tool designed to assist the Groups subsidiaries in addressing a number of areas, such as social policy, environmental, food safety and nutrition issues. These guidelines reflect the perspectives and particular concerns of key categories of stakeholders such as employees, consumers and clients, suppliers, stockholders, the community in general and the environment. Management has assigned specific objectives to the Danone Way: to spread, share and enrich the values and culture of the Group in each country where it operates, to allow subsidiaries to perform self-evaluations with respect to observable and measurable criteria and to have available at the Group level a collection of effective practices. For each stakeholder, each of the subsidiaries teams performs self-evaluations on the basis of a set of practices as defined by the Group. Working groups bringing together individuals from different backgrounds are asked to contribute to the evaluation process. At the end of the process, the results are approved and endorsed by executives of each responsible subsidiary. Thus, the Danone Way has enabled each subsidiary to identify strong and weak points in different areas. It has also allowed them to prioritize and implement plans for improvement. For example, in the context of its social policies, evaluation of management and of the Groups human resource policy is based on 26 criteria set out in several themes: compliance with the law, respect for individuals, progress for organizations and employees, implementing values, and open communication with employees and their representatives, conditions for social dialogue and respect for rules of ethics. The Danone Way was first introduced in 2000, tested in 2001 in approximately 10 subsidiaries and is being deployed worldwide. As of today, 94% of the Groups subsidiaries have implemented the Danone Way and independent reviews have been carried out in 31 subsidiaries by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Mazars to validate their self-evaluations. The audit results show that there are no significant anomalies in the self-evaluations with respect to the procedures defined by the Group. These results are the subject of a report that covers the published consolidated results, which is available on the Internet site of the Group under the heading Sustainable Development. The results of the self-evaluations show high-level practices in areas relating to employees, shareholders, customers and suppliers. The results in areas relating to the environment and local communities are weaker because they are less directly related to the business and correspond to less established practices in certain countries where the Group operates. The implementation of the Danone Way shows its effectiveness in maintaining and promoting the Groupe Danone culture in a context of strong geographic expansion. Over 750 improvement measures are underway in all subsidiaries covering all areas. 70 Table of Contents Local economic impact on emerging economies. The Group has set up operations in many emerging countries, with local production to meet domestic demand. The subsidiaries in developing countries benefit from training programs, technology transfer and modern industrial equipment. Knowledge transfer is facilitated by the Danone Research Center, which works in collaboration with local teams. The effort is aimed at products, quality control and production processes. The Groups activities in a country bring work to numerous local producers and suppliers of goods and services, with which the Group seeks to form long-term relationships to ensure supplies that meet its standards in quantity and quality. In addition, the Groups industrial activities cause suppliers of specialized equipment (packaging machines, etc.) to establish a permanent presence in the countries where the Group operates and facilitate the formation of teams that work, for example, with milk producers on the feeding of livestock, cultivation methods, etc. Corporate citizenship. Involvement in the community is both a necessity and a founding principle of the Groups corporate culture. Generally speaking, the Group is involved in offering support for public bodies, NGOs and local non-profit associations and communities. Publications. Between 1998 and 2005, the Group had published a Social and Environmental Responsibility Report, which presented the social and environmental impacts of the Groups activities. In 2006, the Group decided to combine the Social and Environmental Responsibility Report with the Business Report. In addition, the information corresponding to the reporting for Sustainable Development (Global Reporting Initiative, launched in 1997 in conjunction with CERES and the United Nations Environment Program) as well as the indicators required by law under the Nouvelles Régulations Economiques (NRE) are available on the Internet site of the Group, under the heading Sustainable Development. 71 Table of Contents Item 7.

Stock purchase plans Stock options are granted annually to the Companys senior management. The general meeting of shareholders, by successive authorizations, authorized the board of directors to grant, once or multiple times, over a maximum period of 26 months, options to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company subject to a limit of 1% of the Companys share capital for the 1997 plan, a limit of four million shares for the May 1999, May 2001 and April 2003 plans (after taking into account the two-for-one stock split on June 15, 2004) and a limit of three million shares for the April 2005 plan. Pursuant to these authorizations, the board of directors granted to the Companys senior management stock options to acquire a total of 13,898,503 shares.

The Offer and ListingPrice History of Shares. Related Party Transactions In June 1998, the Company, Sofina, its wholly owned subsidiary Interamerican Finance and Danasia Participations, an affiliate of Sofina, entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding their respective ownership interests in Danone Asia Pte Ltd, a holding company for Groupe Danones investments in the Asia-Pacific region. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, Sofina, Interamerican and Danasia had an option to sell to the Company, and the Company had an option to buy from them, their entire ownership interest in Danone Asia Pte Ltd. These options were exercisable in thirds, beginning, respectively, on January 1, 2003, January 1, 2005 and July 1, 2006, at a price to be determined based on an agreed upon formula, taking into account the then current market value of the shares. At the end of 2002, Danone confirmed its intention to exercise these three purchase options. The interest of the Group in Danone Asia increased from 90.34% at December 31, 2002 to 93.56% at December 31, 2003, to 96.78% in January 2005 and to 100% on July 1, 2006. In addition, in December 2001, the Company granted to Union Financière Boël preemptive acquisition rights exercisable at market value with respect to Sofina shares held by a subsidiary of the Company. In December 2004, the Group sold its interests in Sofina. Mr. Yves Boël, one of the Companys directors until April 2002 and currently an honorary director, was the Chairman of Sofina and the delegated Chairman (administrateur délégué) of Union Financière Boël, and Mr. Richard Goblet dAlviella, one of the Companys current directors, is a delegated director of these two companies. In addition, Mr. Franck Riboud was a director of Sofina until June 2006. See Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesDirectors and Senior ManagementBoard of Directors. Each of the above-referenced transactions was entered into on an arms-length basis according to the Companys normal business practices. No loans or guarantees were granted or made by the Company or its subsidiaries to any member of the executive committee. 74 Table of Contents Transactions by Directors and members of the Executive Committee (mandataires sociaux) of the Companys shares Name Type of transaction Date oftransaction Unitprice(ineuros) Numberofshares Totalamount (ineuros) Frank Riboud(1) Exercise of purchase options 02/27/2006 58.09 60,000 3,485,400 Sale 02/27/2006 97.00 60,000 5,820,000 Exercise of purchase options 08/03/2006 73.57 65,000 4,782,050 Sale 08/03/2006 104.36 (2) 65,000 6,783,229 Exercise of purchase options 12/01/2006 69.40 28,000 1,943,200 Sale 12/14/2006 119.90 1,528 183,270 Jacques Vincent Exercise of purchase options 02/21/2006 73.57 60,000 4,414,200 Sale 02/21/2006 94.25 47,630 4,489,127 Sale 04/04/2006 101.50 2,300 233,450 Exercise of purchase options 09/14/2006 69.40 60,000 4,164,000 Sale 09/14/2006 108.80 21,000 2,284,800 Sale 10/20/2006 115.70 9,150 1,058,655 Sale 10/20/2006 115.70 8,970 1,037,829 Emmanuel Faber Exercise of purchase options 08/03/2006 69.40 26,500 1,839,100 Sale 08/03/2006 104.55 (2) 26,500 2,770,575 Exercise of purchase options 08/03/2006 73.57 60,000 4,414,200 Sale 08/03/2006 104.35 (2) 60,000 6,261,000 Bernard Hours Exercise of purchase options 03/08/2006 58.09 2,000 116,180 Exercise of purchase options 03/08/2006 61.98 4,000 247,920 Sale 03/09/2006 96.09 4,000 384,360 Exercise of purchase options 06/05/2006 58.09 1,200 69,708 Exercise of purchase options 09/04/2006 51.53 12,000 618,360 Sale 09/04/2006 107.14 (2) 12,000 1,285,680 Christian Laubie Sale 08/03/2006 105.54 3,000 316,614 Sale 08/31/2006 107.90 2,000 215,800 Sale 09/12/2006 108.90 3,000 326,700 Benoît Potier Purchase 05/19/2006 91.45 500 45,725 Georges Casala Exercise of purchase options 02/22/2006 44.25 30,000 1,327,500 Sale 09/04/2006 107.90 1,500 161,850 Sale 09/15/2006 109.90 1,500 164,850 Thomas Kunz(3) Exercise of purchase options 9/20/2006 69.40 12,000 832,800 Sale 9/20/2006 108.80 20,000 2,176,000 Exercise of purchase options 9/20/2006 61.98 4,000 247,920 Exercise of purchase options 9/20/2006 73.57 4,000 294,280 Philippe-Loïc Jacob Exercise of purchase options 11/21/2006 69.40 3,200 222,080 Sale 11/21/2006 119.18 3,200 381,376 Exercise of purchase options 12/13/2006 64.19 1,400 89,866 Exercise of purchase options 12/13/2006 61.98 800 49,584 (1) Three persons related to Mr. Riboud each completed a sale of 3,765 shares of the Company on December 14, 2006 at a price per share of 119.90 euros.

Financial Information Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information See Item 18. Financial Statements, for a list of the financial statements filed with this annual report. Dividend Policy The declaration and amount of dividends to be paid on the shares in respect of any period are subject to the decision by the Companys shareholders at an ordinary general meeting of shareholders. Pursuant to French law, payment of dividends must be made within nine months following the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. Under French law and the Companys bylaws, the Companys unconsolidated statutory net income in each fiscal year, as increased or reduced, as the case may be, by any profit or loss of the Company carried forward from prior years, less any contributions to legal reserves, is available for distribution to the shareholders of the Company as dividends, subject to other applicable requirements of French law and the Companys bylaws. Pursuant to the Companys bylaws, the Companys shareholders may determine at an ordinary meeting the portion, if any, of dividends that each shareholder may elect to receive in shares. For dividends distributed in respect of the years 1989 through 1995, each of the Companys shareholders was given the option of receiving dividends in the form of cash or shares. Applications for dividend payments in the form of shares shall be submitted no later than three months after the date on which the general shareholders meeting is held. The board of directors does not intend to recommend a stock dividend in the near future. Dividends paid to holders of shares or ADSs who are not residents of France generally will be subject to French withholding tax at a rate of 25%. Under certain tax treaties entered into between France and other countries, such withholding tax may be reduced to 15% for holders of shares who qualify for the benefits of these treaties, subject to certain procedures and exceptions. Under the Treaty between France and the United States for Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and Capital signed on August 31, 1994 (the Treaty), such reduced withholding tax may apply to holders of shares and also to holders of ADSs, who are residents of the United States as defined by the provisions of the Treaty, subject to certain procedures and exceptions. French individual residents are entitled to a tax credit with respect to dividends paid to them since January 1, 2005, which is equal to 50% of the distributed dividends, capped at  230 or  115 depending on the marital status of the recipient. Under certain tax treaties entered into between France and other countries this French tax credit attached to dividends may, in certain circumstances, be paid, net of withholding tax, to non-French resident individual shareholders. In addition, under the Treaty, such payment of French tax credit, net of withholding tax, may have been available not only to certain individual holders of shares but also to certain individual holders of ADSs, qualifying as U.S. residents under the Treaty, subject to certain exceptions and procedures. See Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationFrench TaxationTaxation of Dividends and Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationTaxation of U.S. InvestorsTaxation of Dividends. Dividends paid to holders of ADSs are converted from euro to dollars and subjected to a charge by the depositary for any expenses incurred by the depositary in such conversion. 76 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the total dividends paid per share and per ADS for each year indicated, with and without the French tax credits attached to dividends and before deduction of any French withholding tax, taking into account the two-for-one stock split effected by the Company in June 2004.

(2) A French tax credit (known as the avoir fiscal) was attached to distributions of dividends made before December 31, 2004. Its amount ranged from 10% to 50% of the dividends depending on the nature of the recipient. For simplification purposes, the avoir fiscal included in the dividend per share in the chart above were calculated at the rate of 50%. From 2005 on, the avoir fiscal has been abolished and partially replaced by a French tax credit benefiting only individuals. Such French tax credit is equal to 50% of the dividends distributed, but capped at 230 or 115 per year depending on the marital status of the recipient. Any payment equivalent to French tax credits, less applicable French withholding tax, is made only following receipt by the French Tax Administration of a claim for such payment filed by shareholders entitled to such payment, and is generally not expected to be paid before 12 months after the filing of such claim, and after the close of the calendar year in which the respective dividends are paid. See Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationFrench Taxation and Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationTaxation of U.S. Investors. (3) Periods prior to 2006 translated solely for convenience from euro into dollars at the Noon Buying Rates on the respective dividend payment dates, or on the following business day if such date was not a business day in France or the United States. For convenience only, avoir fiscal amounts have been translated into dollars at the Noon Buying Rates on such dates although such amounts are paid subsequent to such payment dates. The Noon Buying Rates may differ from the rate that may be used by the Depositary to convert euro to dollars for purposes of making payments to holders of ADSs. Figures for 2005 translated solely for convenience at the Noon Buying Rate on December 29, 2006 of $ 1.3197 per  1.00. (4) As each ADS represents one-fifth of one share, the amount of dividends per share has been divided by five to obtain the historical dividends declared per ADS. (5) Dividends to be proposed at the shareholders meeting to be held on April 26, 2007. Legal Proceedings On December 5, 2001, the European Commission concluded that anti-competitive practices in the beer market in Belgium had occurred and imposed a fine of  44.6 million on the Company. The entire amount was provisioned in the Groups accounts at December 31, 2001 and was paid in 2002. In February 2002, the Company launched a procedure seeking to recover the amount paid. In October 2005, the Court of First Instance confirmed the decision of the European Commission. However, the Court decided to slightly reduce the amount of the fine imposed, from  44.04 to  42.41 million, finding that the Commission had incorrectly determined that an aggravating circumstance existed. The Company has appealed this decision to the European Court of Justice. This appeal was rejected by the European Court of Justice in February 2007. The Group is not presently party to litigation or arbitration that could have or has had, in the recent past, a significant effect on its financial condition, activities or results. The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business. Liabilities are accrued for when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 77 Table of Contents Item 9. The Offer and Listing Price History of Shares The principal trading market for the Companys shares is the Euronext Paris SA, or Euronext Paris, the French integrated national dealing system through which trading in all French listed securities occurs. The Companys shares are traded on Eurolist by Euronext (ISIN Code: FR0000120644) and are included in the CAC 40 Index, the principal stock exchange index published by Euronext Paris, the market enterprise which manages and operates the French stock exchange markets and are included in the Dow Jones Eurostoxx and Dow Jones Stoxx. Since September 25, 2000, the Companys shares are eligible for deferred settlement service. The Companys shares have been included in the Eurostoxx 50 index and Dow Jones Sustainability World Index since September 2000. In the first half of 2004, the Company delisted its shares from the London Stock Exchange and the Brussels Stock Exchange, due to the low liquidity of the shares on these exchanges. The delisting from the London Stock Exchange occurred on March 24, 2004 and the delisting from the Brussels Stock Exchange occurred on May 11, 2004. Since December 1990, the Company has sponsored an American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, program in the United States with Citibank, N.A., as depositary. The American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, issued pursuant to such program have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under a Registration Statement on Form F-6. Each such ADS represents one-fifth of one share. Since November 20, 1997, the ADSs have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DA. Groupe Danone has reached its current filing limit for ADRs. As a result, Citibank, N.A., as depositary, will no longer accept deposits of ordinary shares for the issuance of ADRs for Groupe Danone until further notice. The Groupe Danone ADR Program remains open for the cancellation of ADRs. As of December 31, 2005, 24,243,025 ADSs were outstanding, representing approximately 1.86% of the Companys outstanding shares, and there were 164 holders of record of ADSs, 3 of which had addresses outside the United States. The table below sets forth the reported high and low sales prices for the Companys shares reported by Euronext Paris and for the ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange for the periods indicated.

On March 30, 2007, the last reported listed price of the Companys shares on Euronext Paris was  123.19 per share and the last reported listed price of the Companys ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange was $35.72 per ADS. Plan of Distribution Not applicable. Nature of Trading Market Generals On September 22, 2001 upon successful completion of an exchange offer, the Paris-BourseSBF SA, or the SBF, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the Brussels Stock Exchange merged to create Euronext, the first pan-European exchange. Through the exchange offer, all the shareholders of the SBF, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the Brussels Stock Exchange contributed their shares to Euronext N.V., a Dutch holding company. The Portugal Exchange was integrated into Euronext in February 2002. In January 2002, Euronext N.V. acquired the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE), Londons derivative market, and created Euronext.liffe. Euronext.liffe is the international derivatives business of Euronext, comprising the Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, London and Paris derivatives markets. Euronext.liffe creates a single market for derivatives, by bringing all of its derivatives products together on one electronic platform, LIFFE CONNECT®. Euronext N.V. is listed on Eurolist by EuronextTM. Securities quoted on exchanges participating in Euronext cash markets are traded and cleared over common Euronext platforms. NSC is the common platform for trading, Clearing 21 is the platform for clearing. In addition, Euronext Paris anticipates the implementation of central clearinghouse (but not before 2008), settlement and custody structures over a common system. However, these securities will remain listed on their local exchanges. As part of Euronext, Euronext Paris retains responsibility for the admission of shares to Euronext Paris trading markets as well as the regulation of those markets. Euronext Paris As from February 21, 2005, all securities currently traded on the Premier, Second and Nouveau Marchés are listed and traded on a single market, Eurolist by Euronext, which is operated by Euronext Paris. In accordance with Euronext Paris rules, the shares issued by domestic and other companies are classified in capitalization 79 Table of Contents compartments. The shares of listed companies are distributed between three capitalization compartments, according to the criteria set by Euronext Paris:  Compartment A comprises the companies with market capitalizations above  1 billion;  Compartment B comprises the companies with market capitalizations from  150 million and up to and including  1 billion;  Compartment C comprises the companies with capitalizations below  150 million. The Companys shares have been classified in Compartment A of the Eurolist by Euronext market. In addition, securities of certain other companies are traded on a non-regulated over-the-counter market, the Marché Libre OTC, which is also operated by Euronext Paris. Securities listed on Euronext Paris are placed in one of two categories, Continu (continuous trading) or Fixing (call auctions), depending on the volume of transactions. The Companys shares are listed in the category known as Continu, which includes the most actively traded securities. The minimum yearly trading volume required for a security to be placed in Continu is 2,500 trades. Securities listed on Eurolist by Euronext are traded through authorized financial institutions that are members of Euronext Paris. Trading on Eurolist by Euronext takes place continuously on each business day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (Paris time), with a pre-opening session from 7:15 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and a pre-closing session from 5:30 p.m. to 5:35 p.m. during which transactions are recorded in the central order book but not executed, a closing auction at 5:35 p.m. and a trading at last phase from 5:35 p.m. to 5:40 p.m. (during which transactions are executed at the closing price). Any trade of securities effected after the close of a stock exchange session is recorded on the next Euronext Paris trading day at the previous sessions closing price for the relevant security. Euronext Paris publishes a daily official price list that includes price information concerning listed securities. Euronext Paris has introduced continuous electronic trading during trading hours for most actively traded securities. Any trade of a security that occurs outside trading hours is completed at a price within a range of 1% of the closing price for that security. Trading in the listed securities of an issuer may be suspended by Euronext Paris if quoted prices exceed certain price limits defined by the regulations of Euronext Paris. In particular, if the quoted price of a Continu security, such as the Companys shares, varies by more than 10% from a reference price, Euronext may suspend trading (for the portion of the orders which would be traded outside the 10% threshold) for up to four minutes. The reference price is usually the opening price, or, with respect to the first quoted price of a given trading day, the last traded price of the previous day, as adjusted if necessary by Euronext Paris to take into account available information. Further suspensions for up to four minutes are also possible if the price again varies by more than 10% from a new reference price equal to the price which caused the first trading suspension. Euronext Paris may also suspend trading for a four-minute period if trades are bound to breach the so-called dynamic thresholds, set at 2% plus or minus the last trade price. Euronext Paris may also suspend trading of a listed security in certain other circumstances, including, for example, the occurrence of unusual trading activity in such security. In addition, in exceptional cases, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (the AMF) may also suspend trading. All trades of securities listed on Eurolist by Euronext are performed on a cash-settlement basis on the third trading day after the trade. However, market intermediaries are also permitted to offer investors a deferred settlement service (Service à Règlement Différé or SRD) for a fee. The SRD allows investors who elect this service to benefit from leverage and other special features of the monthly settlement market. The SRD is reserved for securities which have a total market capitalization of at least  1 billion and represent a minimum daily trading volume of  1 million and which are normally cited on a list published by Euronext Paris. The Companys shares are eligible for the deferred settlement service. Investors can elect on the determination date (date de liquidation), which is, at the latest, the fifth trading day before the end of the month, either to settle the trade by the last trading day of the month or to pay an additional fee and postpone the settlement decision to the determination date of the following month. 80 Table of Contents Prior to any transfer of securities held in registered form on Eurolist by Euronext, the securities must be converted into bearer form and accordingly inscribed in an account maintained by an accredited intermediary with Euroclear France S.A., a registered clearing agency. Securities transactions are initiated by the owner giving instructions (through an agent, if appropriate) to the relevant accredited intermediary. Trading securities listed on Eurolist by Euronext are cleared and settled through Clearing 21 and Euroclear France S.A. using a continuous net settlement system. A fee or a commission is payable to the broker-dealer or other agent involved in the transaction. Ownership of equities traded on a deferred settlement basis is considered to have been transferred only after the equities have been registered in the purchasers account. Under French securities regulations, any sale of securities executed on a deferred settlement basis during the month a dividend is paid is deemed to occur after the dividend has been paid. If the sale takes place before, but during the month of, a dividend payment date, the purchasers account will be credited with an amount equal to the dividend paid, and the sellers accounts will be debited by the same amount.
