ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS This item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete, change our risk profile, or eventually impact our financial results. The risks we face generally are similar to those experienced, to varying degrees, by all financial services companies. Our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we have an enterprise-wide risk management committee that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure. We have outlined potential risk factors below that we presently believe could be important to us; however, other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict with certainty all potential developments which could affect our financial performance. The following discussion highlights potential risks which could intensify over time or shift dynamically in a way that might change our risk profile. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report (including the material incorporated into this report), among the factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from our past results and from expectations are those discussed in this item. Forward-Looking Statements This report, including materials incorporated into it, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not a representation of historical information but rather are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely, will, going forward, and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond any companys control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: general and local economic and business conditions, including economic recession or depression; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the 17 financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our hedging practices; technology; demand for our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in lending and holding loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and other regulators; actions of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which has purchased securities from us under its Capital Purchase Program; regulatory, administrative, and judicial proceedings and changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that are made in this report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ because of one or more factors, including those listed above or presented below, in other sections of this report, or in material incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report should carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. Competition Risks Like all financial services companies, we compete for customers. Our primary areas of competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans, wealth management, personal or consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, capital markets products and services, and other consumer and business financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. Some competitors are banks, subject to the same regulatory regime as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. For additional information regarding competition for customers, refer to the Competition heading of Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 13 of this report. While we face competition for customers, we also compete for financial capital (see Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 22 of this report) and to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. Labor markets change over time; the segments of that market most useful to us may contract with demographic shifts relating to age, birth rates, education levels, geography, local or regional economic conditions, and other factors. Growth and Disposition Risks Every organization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth in recent years resulted primarily from a combination of: our expansion strategy in banking based on our mortgage operations; acquisition of customers from competitors that have merged with each other; and targeted non-bank business acquisitions. In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions and to take advantage of certain opportunities. As a result, in 2008 we sold 18 our national mortgage platforms, closed our national specialty lending operations, and renewed our emphasis on financial services in our traditional Tennessee-based markets. Additional information concerning these matters is presented under Recent Downturns and Disruptions beginning on page 28. Although our strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue to change, at present our strategys primary components are to invest capital and other resources in our current Tennessee-based retail/commercial banking market footprints, and in our capital markets business. In any case growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth in the past has been primarily organic rather than through substantial acquisitions; in the future, that pattern may shift if opportunities present themselves. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including: ● our ability to attract and retain banking customers in our Tennessee-based regional banking market areas; ● in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time successfully identifying and exploiting opportunities for new products and services, and for new customers, in the US and overseas; ● our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently; ● our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth; and ● our ability to manage the operational, cultural, and (in some cases) liquidity and capital difficulties associated with growth through purchases. We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various risks associated with that practice, including: ● our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the contingent risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately; ● our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively; ● our ability to integrate the name recognition and goodwill of the acquired company with our own; and, ● our ability to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company. At times a company must consider disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses or units that no longer fit into managements plans for the future. Key risks associated with dispositions, including closures, include: ● our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate appropriate terms; ● our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses; ● our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the disposed or exited business had with our retained businesses; and ● our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of a closure or other disposition that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss to us. 19 Credit Risks Like all other lenders, we face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a loss. In our business some level of credit loss is unavoidable and overall levels of credit loss can vary over time. In 2008 credit losses increased to historically high levels, as mentioned in Recent Downturns and Disruptions beginning on page 28. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and the value of collateral, including real estate. We manage credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio and managing its granularity, and by recording and managing an allowance for expected loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We also record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules could change and cause charge-offs to increase for reasons related or unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio. This risk is shared with all financial institutions. Moreover, the SEC could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the OCC or other regulators for the Bank. A significant challenge for us is to keep the models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Additional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions Credit Risk Management beginning on page 37, Foreclosure Reserves beginning on page 54, and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 47, of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Insurance We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property, legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when feasible and practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation. A portion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified and the disruption to the default insurance industry could curtail our ability to originate new loans that need such insurance, which would result in a loss of business for us. Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for 20 loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit products, fixed income products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, or national) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, and lower fees from transactions and services. These risks are faced by all financial services companies. Additional information illustrating these risks is given in Recent Downturns and Disruptions beginning on page 28. Hedge Risks In the normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking, mortgage, and capital markets, we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. Our hedging activities are discussed in more detail in various places under the following captions of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginning on page 29; and, Critical Accounting Policies, beginning on page 47. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Reputation Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and our financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management. Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk. Operational Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate processes; faulty or disabled computer systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. 21 In addition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties. Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent we increase our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult. For example, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage origination and servicing platforms. We retained significant servicing right assets, however, and we continue to originate mortgage products in our regional banking markets in and around Tennessee. Of practical necessity, we have outsourced our servicing functions to the purchaser of our platforms, and we have outsourced many key roles in the Tennessee-based mortgage origination process to a third party. Managing the operational, compliance, reputational, liability, and other risks associated with this level of outsourcing in those business areas is an ongoing challenge for us. Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk is specifically managed through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessment by line management and oversight of processes by top management, and by maintaining systems to adhere to regulatory guidance. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them appears under the caption Operational Risk Management beginning on page 37 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks Management of liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additional information concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the caption Liquidity Management beginning on page 32 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Our funding requirements currently are met principally by deposits and financing from other financial institutions. Historically we also depended upon financing from institutional investors by means of the capital markets; however, in 2008 and continuing into early 2009 we have not been able to utilize those markets economically, and we are not able to predict when we will be able to utilize them again. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. A number of factors could make such funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets, and may become or remain increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control. 22 Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors which adversely impact our ability or desire to access the capital markets for funding likewise may adversely affect the demand for our services in our capital markets business. As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit as well as in our regional banking unit. For instance, the disruptions in 2007 and 2008 that were related to mortgages and mortgage-backed assets significantly reduced the demand for certain of our capital markets products and services, and increased the costs and uncertainties associated with our mortgage servicing portfolio. Rating agencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role, agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. The Corporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entities for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. At the present time, all three rating agencies rate the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade, although we are at or near the lowest levels of that grade. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Regulatory laws or rules that establish minimum capital levels or define risk-weighting for capital, regulate deposit insurance, and govern related funding matters for banks could be changed in a manner that could increase our overall cost of capital and thus reduce our earnings. Before we disposed of our national lending operations, we depended on our ability to sell or securitize first- and second-lien mortgage loans and, prior to 2007, home equity line of credit loans (which we refer to as HELOC), and we depended upon our ability to sell mortgage servicing rights. Those actions involved the sale of whole loans or of beneficial interests in loans. In 2007 the markets for loans, loan securitizations, and servicing rights experienced significant disruptions; additional information concerning that is presented in Recent Downturns and Disruptions beginning on page __ of this report. Going forward, our mortgage origination activity continues within our Tennessee-based regional banking footprint. Most mortgages originated are processed, sold, and serviced on a private-label basis through a third party under contract with us. However, risks pertaining to our new loan originations, our retained loans and servicing rights assets, and our former funding activities, continue. When we sold or securitized mortgage and HELOC loans, we sometimes did so with varying degrees of recourse, which meant, in effect, that we retained some of the risk for the loan if it defaulted. Generally we sold or securitized loans with no recourse. A loan sold with recourse means the seller retains substantial or full responsibility if it defaults. For a loan we sold without recourse, we could still bear responsibility to the buyer in many cases if the loan defaulted early or was paid off early (typically within the first 90 days), or if the loan did not conform to representations we made to the buyer at the time of sale. At present, in those cases where we are responsible for a loan for representation non-conformity, usually we satisfy our obligations to the buyer by repurchase. Typically we had similar obligations for breach of representation non-conformity, or early default, if the loan was included on a non-recourse basis in a securitization transaction or if the transaction was a sale of servicing rights. Loans repurchased for representation non-conformity frequently involve default or fraud and therefore frequently result in losses to us. We managed the risk of non-conformity through origination and documentation controls and procedures, and through post-closing quality control processes. In 2008 we experienced an increase in 23 loan repurchases for these reasons, particularly with respect to loans originated under so-called stated income procedures, and that increase could continue throughout 2009. Management maintains a reserve for losses related to loan repurchases due to both non-conformity and recourse obligations. Additional information concerning these risks is set forth under the caption Foreclosure Reserves beginning on page 54 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks A significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and potentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Interest Rate Risk Management beginning on page 29 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Our mortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio is affected by changes in interest rates. Although we sold our mortgage servicing platform in 2008, at present we still retain substantial MSR assets. The value of MSR assets declines when the underlying loans are refinanced or otherwise paid early. Generally, when interest rates increase, the value of MSR generally increases, and when rates decline the value of MSR tends to decline. However, those general tendencies do not result in concrete outcomes in all circumstances; for example, a decrease in interest rates does not always result in a predictable increase in refinancings because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtail credit availability. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rights and Other Related Retained Interests beginning on page 49 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Like all financial services companies, we face the risks associated with movements in the yield curve. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are equal, or nearly equal, to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normally is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted for short or even protracted periods. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, adversely impacting the revenues of our capital markets business. A prolonged inversion of the yield curve historically is so uncommon that it is difficult to predict all the effects that such a market condition is reasonably likely to create. One such effect upon us during a recent inversion period was an overall increase in the cost of hedging MSR. This cost is tied to factors including volatility in the market place, the shape of the yield curve, product duration, risk tolerance and other effects which may favorably or unfavorably impact hedging cost. Expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements, particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which in turn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain. 24 Securities Inventories and Market Risks Our capital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for its institutional customers. In the course of that business we hold inventory positions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debt securities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities through certain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related to certain interest rate risks. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Market Risk Management beginning on page 36 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report, and in the Credit Risks discussion beginning on page 20 of this report. In addition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources. Venture Capital Risks Venture capital investments are inherently volatile. The companies in which we have invested are much less mature, smaller, and much more unproven than a typical public company. Accordingly, those investments carry a substantial risk of loss. Venture capital investments also are inherently illiquid. Success in this business can only be assessed in the long term and depends to a very large extent upon the ability of management to find sound investment prospects, negotiate financially appropriate investment terms, and oversee each investment as the company uses the venture capital and develops. In the short term, venture capital losses are not uncommon even if the business proves to be successful in the long term. In 2008 we decided to begin winding down this business; however, due to the illiquid nature of these investments, the wind-down process could be lengthy. Regulatory and Legal Risks We operate in a heavily regulated industry and therefore are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, insurance brokerage, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 4 above, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities occasionally consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customer information and increasing our costs. In addition, changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. 25 The Bank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios, as discussed under the caption Capital Adequacy beginning on page 6 of this report. If the Bank experiences continuing financial losses, its ability to meet those requirements could be adversely affected. Pressure to maintain capital and capital ratios during times of financial loss, especially protracted loss, may lead to actions that are adverse to our shareholders. Such actions that have already occurred include the elimination of our common cash dividend, the sale of our stock at a time when market prices are disadvantageous, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales or other dispositions of assets or businesses) at a time when market values are depressed. Further such actions could occur if losses continue or worsen. Some state authorities from time to time have challenged, and on occasion continue to challenge, the position of the OCC that it is the exclusive regulator of various aspects of national banks or their operating subsidiaries. If one or more of those challenges were successful, or if Congress or the OCC were to change the applicable banking laws or regulations, we could be impacted significantly, due, among other things, to possible increased regulatory burdens, governmental and private party actions alleging non-compliance with state law, and the expense of tracking and complying with the different laws and regulations of those states in which we do business. In addition, some local governments or agencies recently have claimed that certain lenders in their communities have created a public nuisance, engaged in predatory or discriminatory lending, or otherwise are liable for the alleged consequences of inappropriate consumer lending, especially home mortgage lending. Mass claims of this sort, where alleged damages are measured on a statistical and/or city-wide basis, create litigation costs immediately and create a risk of significant litigation losses for those lenders which are named as defendants in them. Moreover, claims of this sort adversely alter the business climate and raise the costs for all lenders, both in the communities involved and in similar communities across the country. In 2008 the U.S. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, sometimes known as EESA. Under authority of EESA the U.S. Department of the Treasury has initiated a Capital Purchase Program, sometimes referred to as the CPP, which has been implemented in conjunction with the U.S. banking regulators. Under the CPP, the Treasury has purchased preferred stock from approved financial institutions upon terms and conditions set by the Treasury, and in late 2008 the Treasury purchased preferred stock from us. Additional information concerning our participation in the CPP and a debt guarantee program appears in EESA Legislation and TARP Participation beginning on page 9 of this report. Other significant programs are expected to be implemented under EESA, and EESA may be expanded or supplemented by additional legislation. EESA and its announced programs are broad, large, and largely untested. These programs create risks that did not exist previously. Among others, those risks include: whether participation in any of these programs will expose us to intrusive, expensive, or counterproductive government mandates or restrictions; whether failure to participate in any particular program, especially if many competitors do participate, will put us in a disadvantageous position; and, whether the programs as a whole will have significant unintended or unexpected effects on the financial services industry as a whole, or upon regional financial services companies in particular. We also face litigation risks from customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. Litigation is an unavoidable part of doing business, and we seek to manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with certainty. 26 Holding Company Dividends Historically the Corporation has depended upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund common dividends paid to the Corporations shareholders. However, in part because of the losses experienced by the Bank for 2007 and 2008, regulatory constraints generally will prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to the Corporation in 2009 without regulatory approval. Additional information concerning those regulatory restrictions on the Bank is discussed in more detail under the heading Liquidity Management in the Managements Discussion and Analysis section beginning on page 32 of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section is incorporated herein by reference. In 2008 the Corporation discontinued paying a quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders, and began distributing a dividend payable in shares of common stock. As a CPP participant under EESA, we will not be able to reinstate a common cash dividend unless we obtain regulatory consent, among other things. Additional information concerning our participation in the CPP appears in EESA Legislation and TARP Participation beginning on page 9 of this report. Accounting Estimate Risks The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Two of our most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for credit losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionally become highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigation and other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights, goodwill, or other assets, or we may recognize a significant decline in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. For additional information concerning the sensitivity of these estimates, refer to Critical Accounting Policies beginning on page 47 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders. Risks of Expense Control Expenses and other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manage expense growth and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. Geographic Risks Our capital markets business is national in scope, and capital markets is developing business in selected Asian markets. Our traditional banking business remains grounded in, and depends upon, the major Tennessee markets. As a result, to a greater degree than many of our competitors that operate nationally or in much broader regions, our banking business currently is exposed to adverse economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that might primarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do business. 27 Non-U.S. Operations Risks We have two capital markets offices outside of the United States, in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Opening and operating non-U.S. offices creates a number of risks. Specific risks associated with any non-U.S. presence include: the risk that taxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our ability to operate overseas profitably or at all; the risk that our assets and operations in a particular country could be nationalized in whole or part without adequate compensation; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities, denominated in those currencies; and the risk that political or cultural preferences in a particular host country might become antagonistic to U.S. companies. Our ability to manage those and other risks will depend upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in cultural and other expectations applicable to customers, employees, regulators, and vendors and other business partners; our ability to recognize and act upon opportunities and constraints peculiar to the countries and cultures in which our offices operate; our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed; and our ability to anticipate the stability of or changes in the political, legal, and monetary systems of the countries in which our offices operate. Recent Downturns and Disruptions In 2007 and 2008 the U.S. economy in general, and the business environment for financial services companies in particular, experienced a significant downturn. Examples of some of the most significant events related to the downturn include the following: ● Residential housing values in the U.S. have fallen in nearly every market, and in some highly-populated markets values have fallen significantly. ● The volume of residential housing transactions also has stagnated or fallen, and in some markets volume has fallen significantly. ● Except for conforming loans, which are loan products conforming to standards of certain government sponsored entities, rates for some types of home mortgage products have risen sharply and some mortgage products, with new and more restrictive credit criteria, have become difficult for borrowers to obtain even at high interest rates, making it difficult or impossible for some borrowers to refinance an existing mortgage. ● In 2007 investor demand for new-issue mortgage-backed securities fluctuated suddenly and sharply, and for some categories of mortgages it disappeared almost entirely. Although this disruption moderated somewhat in 2008, demand for new-issue non-conforming mortgage-backed securities has not rebounded and seems unlikely to do so for the foreseeable future. ● Many companies in the U.S. in many sectors of the economy have reported financial losses or significant reductions in earnings during 2008. Banks and other companies in the financial services industry have, in general, been especially hard hit. A number of banks failed, or were acquired under circumstances of substantial financial stress, in 2008. ● In 2008 the principal outlets for home mortgages in the U.S., the so-called government-sponsored entities (GSEs), failed financially and were, in effect, taken over by the federal government. Substantial new legislation was enacted during 2008 which changed how the GSEs operate and are regulated. Although by the end of 2008 the function of the GSEs as a buyer of so-called conforming mortgages was continuing, the current situation may be transitional and it is not clear what the status or function of the GSEs will be in the future. ● Unemployment has risen in the latter half of 2008 as some companies have failed and others have reduced their staff. ● Because of these factors, among others, loan defaults, foreclosures, and bankruptcies have risen significantly for individuals and businesses. 28 ● The U.S. Congress enacted sweeping legislation late in 2008, the EESA law mentioned above, under which the Department of the Treasury has invested substantial amounts of capital in banks, including us, and under which government agencies have substantial new powers. At December 31, 2008 EESA had not yet been fully implemented; additional programs could be adopted with unknown consequences to us. ● Early in 2009 Congress amended the EESA law, enacted a major economic stimulus and spending law, and is considering specific additional legislation. Members of Congress have publicly spoken of still other possible legislative actions. Some of those measures could, if enacted, have a substantially larger impact on us than EESA and some could have a substantial adverse effect on our business, operations, and prospects. ● A U.S. government agency has taken a substantial, possibly a controlling, stake in an American insurance holding company. There has been public speculation that a U.S. government agency could take a similar position in one or more large U.S. banking institutions, rather than let the institution(s) fail. The governments indefinite control and operation of such companies would be, in effect, the nationalization of the affected companies. In addition, the government could exercise control over, or very powerfully influence, the banking and other institutions that receive government aid without completely nationalizing them. The competitive and financial impacts upon us of such actions, whether they applied to us directly or only to certain competing institutions, cannot be predicted but could be significantly adverse to us. ● The Federal Reserve has lowered certain short-term interest rates. This has triggered reductions in the prime lending rates charged by most U.S. banks and in some cases has adversely affected the net interest margins that banks achieve. Some geographic areas and business sectors, and some companies and banks, were hurt more than others, or experienced the downturn at different rates or different times. However, by the end of 2008 it is clear that the many and varied significant events of 2007 and 2008 have become a general and serious economic recession. At this time it is not known, and not possible to predict, how long or deep this downturn ultimately will be. Although these adverse events did not create new types of risks, we believe it is useful to highlight in this section some of the key impacts of those events on our business to illustrate how events beyond our control can adversely affect us. Exit from National Mortgage and Specialty Lending Businesses Many of the significant disruptions in 2007 and 2008 impacted our mortgage businesses substantially. We decided to exit those businesses except in our traditional Tennessee-based banking region. In August 2008 we sold our mortgage origination and servicing platforms to MetLife Bank N.A., and during the year we exited the national specialty lending businesses associated with the mortgage business. Substantial Increase in Losses Related to Loans and Exited Businesses Although we sold or closed our national mortgage and other lending businesses, we retain as assets many of the loans that those businesses created which we did not sell, or were not able to sell, in the normal course. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situated across the U.S. We also retain a substantial portion of the mortgage servicing rights that we previously serviced, we retain the hedge positions that we obtained to manage certain risks related to those servicing rights, and we retain the risk of liability to parties with whom we made contracts in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assets and positions continue to impose risks on us. For example: 29 ● The loans on our books have experienced significantly higher default and loss rates compared to recent years past. For example, due to declining home values, home loans secured on a second-lien basis in some cases have little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults. Accordingly, a default on such a loan today will result in a much higher loss than would have resulted previously. It is not possible to predict when default and loss rates will stabilize. ● The incidence of parties claiming that loans that we sold to them did not meet contractual standards has risen recently. That trend may continue as parties seek to mitigate losses they experienced while holding those loans by any means possible. ● The incidence of counterparty loss on hedges, swaps, and other such instruments may rise as those counterparties experience financial stress or failure. Other trends adverse to us may emerge from these legacy assets and positions as counterparties are stressed by economic conditions, and of course some of these impacts apply to continuing businesses. Over time those losses and risks related to legacy items should diminish since there will be many fewer new loans and new contracts, but it is not possible to predict when that may occur. Our other lending businesses remain in place, and we are constantly seeking ways to prudently expand them. We are experiencing a significant increase in default and loss rates in most of those products as well, and demand for new loans has diminished somewhat as business activity in general has become more subdued. We have made adjustments to our underwriting, credit review, and loss mitigation processes and we will continue to seek ways to manage risk and minimize loss; however, we remain in the business of lending and that business carries more risk at present than it has in recent years past. That higher level of risk could increase further, and in any case that risk is likely to continue at an elevated level at least until the economy improves to a significant extent. We regularly review and adjust the allowance for loan losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets as well as changes in housing price appreciation and depreciation. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. That process was made significantly more difficult in 2008, as changes in business and economic conditions required us to adjust and re-adjust our methods. If the credit quality of our customer base continues to materially weaken, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers continues to change materially, or if the allowance for loan losses for any reason is not adequate, our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Decrease in Business Activities The slowdown has reduced business activity, including activity which we finance by making loans and activity from which we earn fee revenues. Some activities have fallen off substantially, notably (for us) certain capital markets structured finance activities. All of these impacts reduce our revenues and our opportunities for new business. Net Interest Margin Compression Falling interest rates in the U.S. could stimulate new demand for consumer and business loans and business activity in general. However, falling rates could also compress our net interest margin, which would negatively affect our financial results. Moreover, that compression could occur whether or not our loan or other businesses experienced any significant stimulus. 30 Deposit run-off risks As mentioned under Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 22 above, we rely significantly upon deposits for liquidity and to fund our business operations. Generally, deposits are a relatively stable and cost-effective source of funding for banks due to many factors, including FDIC deposit insurance. Changes in deposit levels can be influenced substantially by many factors, including customer satisfaction and the interest rates offered to deposit customers. Those rates, in turn, generally reflect prevailing market conditions. During 2008, the media occasionally highlighted the risk of an extreme form of deposit run-off, sometimes referred to as a run on the bank. More moderate levels of run-off can adversely affect banks but are substantially less dramatic and have been significantly less reported. The increased level of public concern created by the current adverse business environment, punctuated by media reports of potential or actual bank failures, increased the risk of some level of deposit run-off for all depositary institutions in 2008. That increased run-off risk applies both generally and in relation to deposits that exceed FDIC insurance coverage. Although late in 2008 FDIC insurance coverage levels were increased and actual run-off activity was mitigated, this risk nevertheless is likely to continue at some elevated level until the economic situation becomes more stable. To manage this risk we maintain cash reserves and access to other liquidity sources to accommodate normal and, to a degree, unusual withdrawal activity, and we strive to respond promptly and accurately to customer concerns that might arise. Potential regulatory and legislative actions may adversely affect mortgage assets The U.S. Congress and other governmental bodies have considered, and in the future may enact or adopt, new laws and regulations intended to modify the terms of outstanding consumer loans in a manner benefiting borrowers at the expense of lenders, restrict the ability of lenders to make new loans, and increase the regulatory burdens and legal risks on lenders and loan servicers. Among other things these initiatives, if enacted or adopted, could pressure or force us to reduce the interest and/or principal of loans, delay foreclosure, provide new defenses to foreclosure or otherwise impair our ability to foreclose on a defaulted mortgage loan, adversely affect our rights if a borrower declares bankruptcy, or otherwise adversely affect our rights with respect to borrowers who are in default or who qualify for such initiatives. The outcome of these initiatives is uncertain. Recovery Act Risks In February 2009, shortly before this Report was filed, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act). Additional information concerning the Recovery Act is provided in EESA Legislation & TARP Participation, particularly the last paragraph of that section on page 11 of this report. Among other things, the Recovery Act generally prohibits incentive compensation, including bonus and retention awards, for the five executives whose compensation is described in detail in our proxy statement (the named executives) and for the twenty employees, excluding the named executives, whose total compensation is the highest (the Highest 20). This restriction on incentives would cease to apply once all of the preferred stock that we sold to the Treasury is redeemed. Many interpretive questions related to the compensation provisions remain unresolved at this early time. The Recovery Act has created several new risks for us and for other institutions that sold preferred stock to the Treasury, including the following: ● Pay Substantially Less Linked to Performance. The restriction on incentive compensation in the Recovery Act may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our highest performing employees, and therefore may adversely affect our business. Historically, we have embraced a pay-for-performance philosophy for employees at many levels of the company. The restriction on incentives may substantially de-link pay from performance for our named executives and for those employees who are in the Highest 20 group. For those de-linked persons salary is likely to become the largest component of their compensation package. It is uncertain how a salary-dominated pay structure for those persons might affect our overall performance during the period in which the restriction applies to us. We believe that strongly linking significant components of pay to performance, particularly at the highest levels, benefits the company and its shareholders, and that the de-linking described above is likely to be disruptive to that philosophy at those levels and contrary to the companys best interests. ● Risks if We Desire to Redeem the Preferred. One way to avoid or mitigate the risks outlined above would be to redeem the preferred shares we sold to the Treasury as soon as possible. However, any redemption would reduce our capital and we cannot redeem stock unless our Board and our regulators conclude it is consistent with safety, soundness, and other corporate and regulatory considerations. Those considerations could constrain our ability to redeem the preferred shares, especially in the short term, unless we create or raise an acceptable amount of replacement capital. Creating new capital typically relies upon retaining earnings. Raising new capital could be significantly dilutive to existing shareholders, especially under current market conditions, and it may not be feasible if, at the time we wish to go to market, the market is disrupted or perceives us unfavorably. ● Interest Rates and Other Economic Changes. The Recovery Act will result in a substantial increase in government expenditures and could substantially increase government debt. It is not clear how those events will affect interest rates or the inflation rate, among other things, but both could rise as a result of the Act. As mentioned above, our businesses are very sensitive to changes in interest rates and sudden changes in rates often have had an adverse effect on us and other financial services companies. In addition, increased interest rates tend to dampen economic activity; if rates were sustained at relatively high levels the current economic recession could be prolonged or deepened, which would adversely affect our customers and us.
