RISK FACTORS results of operations we report could be subject to adjustments, we could incur remediation costs, we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or the effectiveness of our internal controls, or fail to meet our reporting obligations under SEC regulations and the terms of our debt agreements on a timely basis and there could be a material adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. Impairment of our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our earnings. Pursuant to applicable accounting pronouncements, we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We describe the process for testing goodwill more thoroughly in Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies. If we determine that the amount of our goodwill is impaired at any point in time, we are required to reduce goodwill on our balance sheet. If goodwill of our single reporting unit is impaired based on a future impairment test, we will be required to record a significant non-cash impairment charge that may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the impairment of goodwill occurs. As of December 31, 2013, our balance sheet reflected a carrying amount of approximately $476.3 million in goodwill. 30 Table of Contents SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.
