RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risk factors described below in addition to the other information presented in this document. Risks Relating to Our Operations We may suffer reduced profits or losses as a result of intense competition. Our business is highly competitive and requires substantial human and capital resources. Large international competitors and local niche companies serve each of the markets in which we compete. Accordingly, we must make constant efforts to remain competitive and convince potential clients of the quality and cost value of our service offerings. Competitors may also introduce new technology or services that we would have to match in order to remain competitive, which could result in significant development costs for us. In addition, we perform a substantial portion of our business under contracts, often of a long-term nature, with governmental authorities and clients from the industrial and commercial sectors. These contracts are often awarded through competitive bidding, at the end of which we may not be retained even though we may have incurred significant expenses in order to prepare the bid. Over the course of performing certain contracts, we may also be requested by our public or private clients to modify the terms of these contracts, whether called for under the contract or not. These modifications may alter the services provided under the contract, related expenses or billing terms. Finally, our contracts may not be renewed at the end of their term, which in the case of important contracts may oblige us to engage in a costly reorganization or restructuring of assets and operations covered by the contract when the contract does not provide for the transfer of the related assets and employees to the succeeding operator and/or adequate indemnification to cover our costs of termination. Our business operations in some countries may be subject to additional risks. While our operations are concentrated mainly in Europe and North America, we conduct business in markets around the world. Sales generated in countries outside of Europe and North America represented approximately 10.14% of our total revenue in 2006. The risks associated with conducting business in some countries outside of Europe, the United States and Canada can include slower payment of invoices, which is sometimes aggravated by the absence of legal recourse for non-payment, nationalization, social, political and economic instability, increased currency exchange risk and currency repatriation restrictions, among other risks. We may not be able to insure or hedge against these risks. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing for our operations in these countries. The establishment of public utility fees and their structure can depend on political decisions that may impede for several years any increase in fees that no longer allow coverage of service costs and appropriate compensation for a private operator. The occurrence of unfavorable events or circumstances in certain countries may lead us to record exceptional provisions or depreciation charges in connection with our operations in these countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our results. Changes in the prices of fuel and other commodities may reduce our profits. The prices of our supplies of fuel and other commodities, which are significant operating expenses for our businesses, are subject to marked fluctuations. Although most of our contracts contain tariff adjustment provisions that are intended to reflect possible variations in prices of our supplies using certain pricing formulas, such as price index formulas, there may be developments that could prevent us from being fully protected against such increases, such as delays between fuel price increases and the time we are allowed to raise our prices to cover the additional costs, or our failure to update an outdated cost structure formula. In addition, a sustained increase in supply costs beyond the price levels provided for under our adjustment clauses could reduce our profitability to the extent that we are not able to increase our prices sufficiently to cover the additional costs. Our business operations are subject to geopolitical, criminal and terrorist risks. Water is a strategic resource in terms of public health. Accordingly, our activities must comply with laws and regulations that seek to safeguard water resources, production sites and treatment facilities against criminal or terrorist acts. Our activities in the areas of waste management, energy services and public transportation are also subject to similar risks. We may also have employees who work or travel in areas where the risk of criminal acts, kidnapping or terrorism is either temporarily or permanently elevated. As a result, despite the safety measures that we have attempted to implement, any one of our activities may fall victim to criminal or terrorist acts in the future. If an attack were to occur, it could negatively affect our image and have a material adverse effect on our results. 4 Back to contents We have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, which may have a less favorable impact than expected on our activities or affect our financial condition. As part of our business strategy, we have conducted and continue to conduct acquisitions of varying sizes, some of which are significant at the Group level. These acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: (i) the assumptions used in the underlying business plans may not prove to be accurate, in particular with respect to synergies and expected commercial demand; (ii) we may not integrate acquired businesses, technologies, products, personnel and operations effectively; (iii) we may fail to retain key employees, customers and suppliers of the companies acquired; (iv) we may have or wish to terminate pre-existing contractual relationships, which could be costly and/or on unfavorable terms; and (v) we may raise additional debt to finance these acquisitions. As a result, it is possible that the contemplated benefits of completed or future acquisitions may not materialize within the time periods or to the extent anticipated or that such acquisitions may affect our financial condition. Our long-term contracts may limit our capacity to quickly and effectively react to unfavorable general economic changes. The initial circumstances or conditions under which we enter into a contract may change over time, which may result in adverse economic consequences. Such changes vary in nature and foreseeability. Certain contractual mechanisms may help to address the changes and restore the initial balance of the contract. Their implementation may be triggered more or less automatically by the occurrence of a given event (price adjustment clauses for instance), or they may require a contract revision or amendment procedure requiring the agreement of both parties or of a third party. In any case, however, our actions must remain within the scope of the contract and we cannot terminate unilaterally and suddenly a business that we believe to be unprofitable, or change its features. Our compensation, whether it consists of a price paid by the client or a fee levied from end users based on an agreed-up on schedule, may not be changed at any time in line with changes in our costs and demand. These constraints have an impact on our behavior as an economic agent, and are particularly meaningful because our contracts are often entered into for long periods of time. The rights of governmental authorities to terminate or modify our contracts could have a negative impact on our revenue and profits. Contracts with governmental authorities make up a significant percentage of our revenue. In numerous countries, including France, governmental authorities may modify or terminate contracts under certain circumstances, but generally with indemnification. In some countries, however, we may not be entitled to or be able to obtain full indemnification in the event our contracts are terminated by governmental counterparties. We may make significant investments in projects without being able to obtain the required approvals for the project. To engage in business, we must in most cases obtain a contract and sometimes obtain, or renew, various permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities. The competition and/or negotiation process that must be followed in order to obtain such contracts is often long, complex and hard to predict. The same applies to the authorization process for activities that may harm the environment which are often preceded by increasingly complex studies and public investigations. We may invest significant resources in a project or public tender without obtaining the right to engage in the desired business or sufficient compensation or indemnities to cover the cost of our investments, for instance as a result of a failure to obtain necessary permits or authorizations, or approvals from antitrust authorities, or because authorizations are subject to conditions that force us to abandon certain of our developmen t projects. These situations increase the overall cost of our activities and, if we do not obtain the desired business or are forced to withdraw from a public tender, our business may not grow as much or as profitably as we hope. We must comply with various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which is costly and may, in the event of any failure to comply on our part, cause us to incur liability under these laws and regulations. We incur significant costs of compliance with various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We have made and will continue to make significant capital and other expenditures to comply with our environmental, health and safety obligations as well as to ensure sanitary protection of the services we provide. We are continuously required to incur expenditures to ensure that the installations that we operate comply with applicable legal, regulatory and administrative requirements, including general precautionary or preventative measures, or to advise our clients so that they undertake the necessary actions for the compliance of their installations. The costs related to these preventative measures are recorded as either operating expenses or as industrial investments. Our industrial investments totaled €2.197 billion in 2006. 5 Back to contents Each of our operations, moreover, may become subject to stricter general or specific laws and regulations, and correspondingly greater compliance expenditures, in the future. If we are unable to recover these expenditures through higher tariffs, this could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Moreover, the scope of application of environmental, health, safety and other laws and regulations is becoming increasingly broad. These laws and regulations now govern any discharge in a natural environment, the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of all types of waste, the rehabilitation of old sites at the end of operations, as well as ongoing operations at new or old facilities. Our operations and activities may cause us to incur liability or other damages that we might be required to compensate. The increasingly broad laws and regulations expose us to the risk of liability, including in connection with assets that we no longer own and activities that have been discontinued. For example, a French law dated July 30, 2003, relating to the prevention of technological and environmental risks and the conduct of remediation activities, has strengthened the regulatory framework that applies to discontinued operations and closed sites and installations. In some instances, reserves must be established in respect of such discontinued operations. In addition, we may be required to pay fines, repair damage or undertake improvement works, even when we have conducted our activities with care and in total conformity with operating permits. Regulatory authorities may also require us to conduct investigations and undertake remedial activities, curtail operations or close facilities temporarily in connection with applicab le laws and regulations, including to prevent imminent risks or in light of expected changes in those laws and regulations. In addition, we often operate installations that do not belong to us, and therefore do not always have the power to make the investment decisions required to bring these installations into compliance with new regulatory norms. In instances where the client on whose behalf these installations are operated refuses to make the required investments, we may be forced to terminate our operations. In the event of an accident or other incident, we could also become subject to claims for personal injury, property damage or damage to the environment (including natural resources). These potential liabilities may not always be covered by insurance, or may be only partially covered. The obligation to compensate for such damages might have a material adverse effect on our activities or resources. Specific measures are required in connection with certain technological risks (article L. 225-102-2 of the French Commercial Code regarding Seveso facilities). Among the facilities that we own and operate in France, one has been categorized a Seveso facility. Seveso facilities are places where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to or above thresholds specified in European Union Directive 96/82/EC (also known as the Seveso II Directive), relating to the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances. As such, these facilities are the subject of special concern and heightened regulation. Our Seveso facility is a hazardous waste incineration factory at Limay (Yvelines). The manipulation of waste and hazardous products in this facility can, in the case of an accident, cause serious damage to the environment, neighbors or employees, exposing us to potentially substantial liabilities. As part of our outsourcing contracts, our subsidiaries may also be involved in the operation of Seveso sites (or the foreign equivalent) by industrial clients (particularly petroleum or chemical industry sites). In these instances, we must handle the provision of services with even greater care, given the more dangerous nature of the products, waste, effluents and emissions to be treated, as well as the close proximity of the installations we manage to client sites. Finally, while the regulatory regime governing Seveso facilities applies only within the European Union, we operate several similar sites outside of this region which are often subject to the same level of heightened regulation by foreign governments. Currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations may negatively affect our financial results and the price of our shares. We hold assets, earn income and incur expenses and liabilities in a variety of currencies. Our financial statements are presented in euro. Therefore, when we prepare our financial statements, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses in other currencies into euro at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the euro in respect of these other currencies can affect the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. For example, an increase in the value of the euro may result in a decline in the reported value, in euro, of our interests held in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2006, our net financial debt excluding revaluation of hedging instruments amounted to €14.7 billion, of which 25.7% was subject to variable rates and 74.3% to fixed interest rates, including 12.1% subject to variable rates with caps. Our results of operations and financial condition may be affected by changes in prevailing market rates of interest. Fluctuations in interest rates may also affect our future growth and investment strategy, since a rise in interest rates may force us to finance acquisitions or investments or refinance existing debt at a higher cost in the future. Risks Relating to Our Shares and ADSs Because preemptive rights may not be available for U.S. persons, the ownership percentages of our U.S. shareholders may be diluted in the event of a capital increase of our company. Under French law, shareholders have preemptive rights (droits préférentiels de souscription) to subscribe, on a pro rata basis, for cash issuances of new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire additional shares. U.S. holders of our shares may not be able to exercise preemptive rights for our shares unless a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), is effective with respect to those rights or an exemption from the registration requirements imposed by the Securities Act is available. We are not required to file registration statements in connection with issues of new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire shares to our shareholders. As a result, we may from time to time issue new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire additional shares at a time when no registration statement is i n effect. For example, in June 2007 we launched a capital increase through the issuance of rights to acquire new shares to all of our shareholders, but those rights were generally exercisable only by persons located 6 Back to contents outside the United States. Holders of our ADSs were not permitted to exercise the rights corresponding to the shares underlying the ADSs. We are permitted to file less information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) than a company incorporated in the United States. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from rules under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), that impose some disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. Additionally, our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules with respect to their purchases and sales of our shares. Moreover, we are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, there may be less information concerning our company publicly available from time to time than there is for U.S. companies at those times. The ability of holders of our ADSs to influence the governance of our company may be limited. Holders of our ADSs may not have the same ability to influence corporate governance with respect to our company as would shareholders in some U.S. companies. For example, the ADS depositary may not receive voting materials in time to ensure that holders of our ADSs can instruct the depositary to vote their shares. In addition, the depositarys liability to holders of our ADSs for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions is limited by the deposit agreement. Finally, except under limited circumstances, our shareholders do not have the power to call shareholders meetings. 7 Back to contents
