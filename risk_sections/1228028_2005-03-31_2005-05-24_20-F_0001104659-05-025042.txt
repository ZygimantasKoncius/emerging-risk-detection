D. Risk Factors Rinker group entities are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, political, social, industry, business and financial conditions, particularly in the United States and Australia. Certain of these risks are described below. Rinker group entities could also be subject to other risks that management has not anticipated. Rinker groups operations are dependent to a significant extent on demand across the construction industry economic cycle and the Rinker groups revenues and profits in future periods may fluctuate with that cycle. The activity of businesses in the Rinker group is dependent on the level of activity in the construction industry in the various regional markets in the United States and in Australia where Rinker group companies operate. The construction industry in a given geographic market has historically tended to be cyclical. Within each geographic region construction industry spending can vary significantly from peak to trough through the business cycle. The construction industry is also very sensitive to fluctuations in general economic activity in the particular economy. Rinker estimates that a 1% revenue change related to volumes across the Rinker group as a whole, without regard to the different cycles within each industry, region, or market, would have an annual impact on revenue of approximately US$43 million and on EBIT of approximately US$6 million. Rinker is not able to predict the timing, extent or duration of the business cycles or economic downturns in the construction industry in the geographic regions in which Rinker group companies operate. Because many of the Rinker groups costs are fixed, if an extended downturn in one or more segments of the construction industry occurs, particularly in Florida or Arizona in the US and Australia, companies in the Rinker group may not readily be able to reduce their costs in proportion to the extent of the downturn. Any significant or extended downturn in the construction industry in those geographic regions will negatively affect the Rinker groups financial performance and condition where revenues 12 fail to grow or fall and costs do not move to compensate. An overview of the United States and Australian markets is included in Item 4  Information on the Rinker group. The Rinker groups operations are dependent to a significant extent on demand in selected key US states and the Rinker groups revenues and hence profits in future periods may fluctuate with the underlying industry economic cycle of those states. A significant proportion of the Rinker groups revenue was generated from Florida (40%) and Arizona (12%) in the year ended March 31, 2005. As a result, fluctuations in the underlying economic cycle may result in variations in EBIT in similar proportion to the overall margin impact on Rinker as previously described for the construction industry cycle. The Rinker group is especially dependent on market demand for its heavy building materials products in those markets. A downturn in demand in the residential or other heavy building materials markets in these states could have a significant adverse impact on the Rinker groups financial performance and condition where revenues fail to grow or fall and costs do not move to compensate. Government funded construction activity in the US may be lower in future periods and the Rinker groups revenues and profits in future periods may fluctuate depending on the level of Government funding of civil construction. The Rinker groups largest exposure to the US civil construction sector is in roads, highways and bridges. Approximately 20% of the Rinker groups revenue for the year ended March 31, 2005 was estimated to be related to the US civil construction sector. Funding for these infrastructure projects in the US has largely arisen from the Federal Highway Program, Transport Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), covering the period from September 1997 to September 2003 and extended into 2005. The Rinker group has its operations in a number of states in which funding has historically exceeded the US national average. The US Federal Government has not yet approved SAFETEA, the successor to TEA-21, which is the principal source of federal funds in the United States to improve the highway network. Until SAFETEA is approved, the level of future US federal or state infrastructure funding levels is not known. Any significant decrease in such funding levels may negatively affect the Rinker groups financial performance and condition where revenues fall and costs do not move to compensate. The Rinker group has grown significantly through acquisitions and may be unable to continue its growth by this means if suitable opportunities cannot be identified. The Rinker groups performance is also affected by its ability to integrate any acquisitions into its existing operations. The Rinker group has grown significantly in recent years through a series of bolt-on acquisitions, the most recent major acquisition being Kiewit in September 2002. A key element of the Rinker groups growth strategy is to continue its acquisition strategy. The Rinker groups ability to realize benefits from future acquisitions depends, in large part, on its ability to integrate the acquired businesses with its existing operations in a timely and effective manner. The Rinker groups efforts to integrate any future acquisitions may not be successful. The Rinker groups acquisition strategy also depends on its ability to identify and acquire suitable assets at desirable prices. The Rinker group may not be successful in identifying or acquiring suitable assets at acceptable prices in the future. To the extent the Rinker group fails to be successful in acquiring suitable assets at acceptable prices in the future, it is unlikely to be able to continue to grow its earnings at the same rate as it has done in the recent past. Rinker may need to pay for all or part of the purchase price for any future acquisitions with its ordinary shares. These acquisitions and investments, if they were to occur, could have a diluting 13 effect for Rinkers shareholders and, whether they are paid for in cash or Rinker shares may cause Rinkers share price to decrease. The Rinker group may be affected by problems in recently acquired businesses. Unforeseen problems may impact future profits. The Rinker group has completed a number of significant acquisitions during recent years as detailed in Item 4  Information on the Rinker group. The Rinker group may not have anticipated all problems of acquired businesses, and losses associated with these recently acquired businesses may come to light prior to the expiration of any warranty and indemnity protections, or the Rinker group may be unable to enforce such provisions against the parties making the indemnities. If problems arise they may impact the Rinker groups future profit if the Rinker group is required to extinguish unforeseen liabilities or there is significant impairment of assets requiring write down at some future date. The Rinker group may be subject to competition from existing and new market entrants and products, which could impact future revenues and profits. Each market in which Rinker group companies operate is highly competitive. The competitive environment can be significantly affected by a number of regional factors, such as the number of competitors, production capacity, economic conditions and product demand in the relevant regional market. The pricing policies of competitors and the entry of new competitors into the regional markets in which Rinker group companies operate can have an adverse effect on demand for their products and on their financial performance or condition where revenues fail to grow or fall and profit margins are reduced. Rinker group companies face competition from alternative products. For example, the concrete pipe products operations of Rinker Materials and Readymix face competition from plastic, metal and fiber reinforced cement pipe products in the smaller diameter size segment of the market. Product substitution of alternative materials for Rinker group products may have an adverse effect on the Rinker groups financial performance or condition where revenues fail to grow or fall and profit margins are reduced. In many markets in which the Rinker group operates there are no significant entry barriers that would prevent new competitors from entering the market or existing competitors from expanding in the market. Rinker group entities are subject to extensive health, environmental, land use, and other governmental laws and regulations, which could have an impact on the Rinker groups future financial performance. Rinker group entities are subject to extensive health, environmental, land use, and other governmental laws and regulations and increasing regulatory compliance requirements. Depending on the extent of future regulations that may be enacted, Rinker may be required to invest in preventive or remedial action, which could be significant, in which case it could have an adverse impact on the Rinker groups financial performance and condition. Tighter land use or zoning restrictions making new quarry permits more difficult to obtain could also restrict the ability of companies in the Rinker group to conduct their businesses economically or restrict some activities altogether. Environmental liabilities, if incurred, could have an adverse impact on the Rinker groups financial performance and condition. Stricter environmental laws and regulations, or stricter interpretation and enforcement of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on Rinker 14 group companies or result in the need for additional investments in pollution control equipment, either of which could result in a decline in the Rinker groups profitability. Further details regarding environmental regulation and certain liability issues affecting companies within the Rinker group are contained in section Item 4  Information on the Rinker group. Occupational health and safety risks and regulations may have an impact on future productivity and financial performance. Rinker group entities are subject to the operating risks associated with construction materials and other manufacturing and handling risks, including the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. These hazards include storage tank leaks and ruptures, explosions, discharges or releases of hazardous substances, manual handling, exposure to dust and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery. Such operating risks can cause personal injury and property damage, and may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The occurrence of any of these events may have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and the operating results of Rinker group entities through increased costs or reduced operating flexibility and productivity. Crystalline silica dust and its control have been identified as an occupational health issue in Rinker group entities operations in Australia and in the US. Rinker group entities use raw materials containing silica in cement manufacturing, concrete plants, concrete products plants and asphalt plants. Many quarry products also contain silica. Rinker group entities may face future costs of engineering and compliance to meet new standards relating to crystalline silica since regulatory agencies in Australia and the US are re-examining existing standards and considering stricter exposure limits. Rinker group entities cannot reliably quantify future claims related to crystalline silica. Any future claims could have an impact on the Rinker groups profitability. Labor disputes between Rinker group companies and unions could disrupt operations that could have an impact on the Rinker groups future financial performance. Approximately one-third of Rinker Materials employees and half of Readymix employees are members of trade unions. These employees are generally covered by collective bargaining agreements, which periodically come up for renegotiation and renewal. In the next twelve months, 12 contracts, covering approximately 1,250 employees, are scheduled to expire in the United States. In Readymix, Australia, 28 contracts are due to be renegotiated in the next twelve months covering approximately 600 employees. Disputes with trade unions could lead to strikes or other forms of industrial action that could disrupt operations within the Rinker group, raise costs and reduce Rinker groups revenues and profits. Any such disruptions to operations within the Rinker group may adversely affect the groups financial performance and condition through increased costs and reduced productivity. The Rinker group may face potential liability for defective products, which could have an impact on future profits. Due to the nature of its operations, claims against Rinker group entities could arise from defects in material or products manufactured and/or supplied by Rinker group entities. Purchasers and third parties could make claims against Rinker group entities based on their delivery of defective materials or products, or for damage or loss arising from the use of these defective materials or products. If any claims of this type are determined against Rinker group entities and if the Rinker 15 groups existing insurance arrangements do not cover the liability, it could have an adverse effect on the financial performance and condition of the Rinker group due to increased rectification costs or liability for compensation. Antitrust (trade practices) risks may restrict the Rinker groups business activities and its ability to grow. Rinker group entities are subject to antitrust or trade practices laws. Antitrust or competition considerations may restrict business activities within the Rinker group and the ability to grow through acquisitions or participate in industry rationalization in particular geographic markets. This could have an adverse impact on the Rinker groups financial performance where revenues fail to grow or fall and or profit margins are reduced. Operation and supply failures or shortages could have an impact on the Rinker groups future revenues and profits. The manufacturing facilities and supply of finished products to customers of Rinker group entities could be disrupted for reasons beyond their control. These disruptions include extremes of weather, fire, natural catastrophes, supplies of materials, transport logistics, services, energy or fuel, system failures, workforce actions or environmental issues. Any significant disruptions or shortages could adversely affect Rinker group entities ability to make, sell and deliver products, which could cause revenues to decline or costs to increase and result in lower profits Rinker group entities may be required to provide further funds to cover the defined benefit liabilities of those superannuation (pension) funds in which it participates. This may have a negative impact on future profitability. Superannuation (pension) funds in which Rinker group entities participate provide both defined benefits and accumulation benefits. The deficits of US pension plans under US GAAP as of December 31, 2004 total US$22.6 million. Any deficits are intended to be funded progressively by Rinker Materials and all minimum funding requirements have currently been satisfied. There is a risk that, in the future, changes in the value of the funds assets, changes in actuarial determinations of the funds liabilities or changes to government legislation could require Rinker group entities to increase their current level of contributions to these funds and adversely impact financial performance. Details of Rinker group entities defined benefit plans are included in Item 5.H  Details of defined benefits pension plans. The adoption of new accounting standards for the year ending March 31, 2006 may have a material impact on our financial statements and may make a comparison between financial periods more difficult. On July 3, 2002 the Australian Financial Reporting Council announced that Australia would adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), formerly known as International Accounting Standards, for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2005 (fiscal year 2006 for Rinker). Rinker currently reports under Australian Accounting Standards but is required to adopt Australian equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (A-IFRS), which may have a material impact on its financial statements and comparability to the financial statements previously published in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards. For further information on the impact of A-IFRS, see Item 5 - Basis of preparation and presentation. 16 The Rinker group could be affected by interest rate fluctuations. If interest rates rise, borrowing costs may be higher and higher interest rates may adversely affect construction activity levels. The Rinker groups external borrowings at March 31, 2005 were US$868 million of which, prior to the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately US$610 million or 70% was paying interest at fixed rate. Taking into account around US$250 million of variable to fixed rate interest rate swaps in place at March 31, 2005, the Rinker groups net fixed interest rate borrowings were approximately US$860 million or 99 % of gross debt. Accordingly, movements in interest rates may impact the Rinker groups debt servicing obligations and borrowing costs, impacting its financial performance. Rinker estimates that based on the amount of its outstanding indebtedness at March 31, 2005, a 1% increase in variable interest rates would have had approximately a US$0.2 million adverse impact on the Rinker groups net profit for the year ended March 31, 2005. An increase in interest rates may also reduce construction activity levels within both the residential and commercial segments of the market. This could have an adverse impact on the Rinker groups financial performance where revenues fail to grow or fall and costs do not move to compensate. Details on interest rate risks are included in Item 11 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risks. General risks associated with investing in shares may impact the value of Rinker shares and ADRs. Rinker shares commenced trading on the ASX for the first time on March 31, 2003 and therefore do not have a trading history before that date. The price of Rinker ordinary shares and ADRs is subject to many influences that may affect the broad trend in the stock market or the share prices of individual companies. The price at which Rinker ordinary shares trade on ASX and at which Rinker ADRs trade on NYSE may be affected by a number of factors unrelated to the Rinker groups financial and operating performance and over which Rinker has no control. Factors such as currency exchange rates, product prices, the level of industrial production, changes in government fiscal, monetary and regulatory policy, investor attitudes, stock market fluctuations in Australia and other stock markets around the world, changes in interest rates and inflation, and variations in general market or economic conditions could all have an adverse effect on the price of Rinker ordinary shares and ADRs. E. Supplementary Key Information - Australian Dollars Currency of Presentation and Exchange Rates The Rinker group publishes its financial statements in both US dollars and Australian dollars. In this annual report, unless otherwise specified herein or the context requires, references to US$ or US dollars are in United States dollars and references to A$ or Australian dollars are to Australian dollars. Rinker Materials maintains its financial records in US dollars and Readymix maintains its financial records in Australian dollars. For the year ended March 31, 2005, around 80% of the Rinker groups trading revenue was generated by Rinker Materials in the US. For the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there were virtually no movements of currency between US dollars and Australian dollars that resulted in a material amount of realized exchange gains or losses. The business activity in Australia is generating cash flow that is generally adequate to service the current level of Australian dollar dividends. As a result, the only significant impact of changes in the US dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate is one of accounting translation for financial reporting purposes. An appreciation of 17 the A$ relative to the US$ would be expected to have a favorable impact on the Rinker groups reported US$ results. The directors believe that the best measure of performance for Rinker Materials in the US and Readymix in Australia is their respective local currencies in as much as each generates all revenue and incurs all costs in that local currency. Set out below is supplementary selected financial data for the Rinker group in Australian dollars. Selected financial information in US dollars is set out starting at page 10. The following table sets forth, for each of the Rinker groups fiscal years indicated and for the most recent months, the high, low, average and period-end Noon Buying Rates for Australian dollars expressed in United States dollars per A$1.00.

On May 12, 2005, the Noon Buying Rate was A$1.00 = US$0.7679. The Australian dollar is convertible into United States dollars at freely floating rates and there are currently no restrictions on the flow of Australian currency between Australia and the United States.

Prior to that time Rinker was a 100% owned subsidiary of CSR. The weighted average number of ordinary shares assumes that same number of shares existed throughout the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001. During the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, Rinker issued 237,900 and 324,700 shares respectively as part of the Employee Universal Share Plan (USP). During the year ended March 31, 2005, Rinker purchased 4,000,028 shares as part of an on-market buy-back. See Item 16.E.  Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers for further details. 20 (2) For fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, based on the 944.7 million Rinker ordinary shares issued and outstanding subsequent to the demerger. Diluted earnings per share are equivalent to basic earnings per share. (3) Dividends shown for 2005 and 2004 represent the amounts provided for. The dividends in 2003 and 2001 represent amounts paid to CSR when Rinker was a wholly owned subsidiary. Dividend per share information for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 has therefore been based on the 944.7 million shares issued and outstanding subsequent to the demerger. These amounts are not necessarily representative of the amount that would have been paid if Rinker had been a separate publicly listed company. (4) Income from continuing operations is the same as net profit attributable to the members of Rinker, and income from continuing operations per share is the same as basic earnings per share. (5) Throughout this annual report EBIT means profit from ordinary activities before finance and income tax in accordance with Australian GAAP. (6) Operating capital expenditure represents capital expenditure required to maintain existing operating capabilities. (7) Development capital expenditure represents capital expenditure to acquire businesses, expand operating capabilities and extend market coverage.
