Item 1A. Risk Factors. Investing in our common stock involves significant risks relating to our business and investment objective. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before you purchase any of our common stock. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Unknown additional risks and uncertainties, or ones that we currently consider immaterial, may also impair our business. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In this event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks related to the companies in our portfolio. The recent financial crisis could increase the non-performance risk for our portfolio companies. The global financial markets are in turmoil, and the economies of the U.S. and many other countries are in recession, which may be severe and prolonged. This status results in severely diminished opportunities for liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about overall economic stability, and there can be no assurance against further decline. These conditions adversely affect the availability of capital to meet the funding needs of our portfolio companies as the majority of our portfolio companies, and venture-backed companies in general, have negative cash flows, and thus require follow-on financings to continue operations. A substantial decrease in the availability of this necessary capital would dramatically increase the risk of these companies. We define non-performance as the risk that a portfolio company will be unable to raise additional capital. In these circumstances, the portfolio company could be recapitalized at a valuation significantly lower than the post-money valuation implied by our valuation method, sold at a loss to our investment or shut down. A continuing lack of initial public offering opportunities and a decrease in merger and acquisition transactions may cause companies to stay in our portfolio longer, leading to lower returns, write-downs and write-offs. Beginning in about 2001, many fewer venture capital-backed companies per annum have been able to complete initial public offerings (IPOs) than in the years of the previous decade. Moreover, in 2008, according to the National Venture Capital Association, there were only six venture capital-backed companies that completed IPOs, the fewest annual venture-backed offerings since 1977. There were no venture-backed IPOs in the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2008, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, the venture capital-backed companies that completed IPOs had a median age of about 8.3 years. Also according to Dow Jones VentureSource, the market for mergers and acquisitions ("M&A") during 2008 experienced a drop in the number of transactions by 28.8 percent and in median transaction price by 50 percent. 15 Now that some of our companies are becoming more mature, a continuing lack of IPO opportunities and decrease in the number and size of M&A transactions for venture capital-backed companies could lead to companies staying longer in our portfolio as private entities that may require additional funding. In the best case, such stagnation would dampen returns, and in the worst case, could lead to write-downs and write-offs as some companies run short of cash and have to accept lower valuations in private financings or are not able to access additional capital at all. A continuing lack of IPO opportunities and the decrease in the number and size of M&A transactions for venture capital-backed companies are also causing some venture capital firms to change their strategies. Accordingly, some venture capital firms are reducing funding of their portfolio companies, making it more difficult for such companies to access capital and to fulfill their potential. In some cases this leads to write-downs and write-offs of such companies by other venture capital firms, such as ourselves, who are co-investors in such companies. Investing in small, private companies involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative. We have invested a substantial portion of our assets in privately held development stage or start-up companies, the securities of which are inherently illiquid. These businesses tend to lack management depth, to have limited or no history of operations and to have not attained profitability. Companies commercializing products enabled by nanotechnology or microsystems are especially risky, involving scientific, technological and commercialization risks. Because of the speculative nature of these investments, these securities have a significantly greater risk of loss than traditional investment securities. Some of our venture capital investments are likely to be complete losses or unprofitable, and some will never realize their potential. We have been and will continue to be risk seeking rather than risk averse in our approach to venture capital and other investments. Neither our investments nor an investment in our common stock is intended to constitute a balanced investment program. We may invest in companies working with technologies or intellectual property that currently have few or no proven commercial applications. Nanotechnology, in particular, is a developing area of technology, of which much of the future commercial value is unknown, difficult to estimate and subject to widely varying interpretations. It is sets of enabling technologies that are applicable to a diverse set of industries. As such, nanotechnology-enabled products must compete against existing products or enable a completely new product in a given industry. There are as of yet relatively few nanotechnology-enabled products commercially available. The timing of additional future commercially available nanotechnology-enabled products and the industries on which nanotechnology will have the most significant impact is highly uncertain. 16 Our portfolio companies may not successfully develop, manufacture or market their products. The technology of our portfolio companies is new and in many cases unproven. Their potential products require significant and lengthy product development, manufacturing and marketing efforts. To date, many of our portfolio companies have not developed any commercially available products. In addition, our portfolio companies may not be able to manufacture successfully or to market their products in order to achieve commercial success. Further, the products may never gain commercial acceptance. If our portfolio companies are not able to develop, manufacture or market successful nanotechnology-enabled products, they will be unable to generate product revenue or build sustainable or profitable businesses. Adverse conditions in the target markets of our portfolio companies may limit or prevent commercial success regardless of the contribution of nanotechnology to these products. Our portfolio companies working with nanotechnology and microsystems may be particularly susceptible to intellectual property litigation. Research and commercialization efforts in nanotechnology and microsystems are being undertaken by a wide variety of government, academic and private corporate entities. As additional commercially viable applications of nanotechnology emerge, ownership of intellectual property on which these products are based may be contested. From time to time, our portfolio companies are or have been involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation. Any litigation over the ownership of, or rights to, any of our portfolio companies’ technologies or products could have a material adverse effect on those companies’ values. The value of our portfolio could be adversely affected if the technologies utilized by our portfolio companies are found, or even rumored or feared, to cause health or environmental risks, or if legislation is passed that limits the commercialization of any of these technologies. Nanotechnology has received both positive and negative publicity and is the subject increasingly of public discussion and debate. For example, debate regarding the production of materials that could cause harm to the environment or the health of individuals could raise concerns in the public’s perception of nanotechnology, not all of which might be rational or scientifically based. Nanotechnology in particular is currently the subject of health and environmental impact research. If health or environmental concerns about nanotechnology or microsystems were to arise, whether or not they had any basis in fact, our portfolio companies might incur additional research, legal and regulatory expenses, and might have difficulty raising capital or marketing their products. Government authorities could, for social or other purposes, prohibit or regulate the use of nanotechnology. Legislation could be passed that could circumscribe the commercialization of any of these technologies. 17 Our Nanotech for Cleantech™ portfolio is currently the largest and fastest growing portion of our venture capital portfolio, and, therefore, fluctuations in its value may adversely affect our net asset value per share to a greater degree than other sectors of our portfolio. The fastest growing portion of our portfolio is our Nanotech for Cleantech™ portfolio, which consists of companies commercializing nanotechnology-enabled products targeted at cleantech-related markets. There are risks in investing in companies that target cleantech-related markets, including the rapid and sometimes dramatic price fluctuations of commodities, particularly oil and public equities, the reliance on the capital and debt markets to finance large capital outlays and the dependence on government subsidies to be cost-competitive with non-cleantech solutions. For example, the attractiveness of alternative methods for the production of biobutanol and biodiesel can be adversely affected by a decrease in the demand or price of oil. The demand for solar cells is driven primarily by government subsidies and the availability of credit to finance the purchase and installation of the system. Adverse developments in any of these sectors may significantly affect the value of our Nanotech for Cleantech portfolio, and thus our venture capital portfolio as a whole. Additionally, companies with alternative energy (cleantech) platforms are currently in favor with the media and investors. Cleantech companies in general may have a harder time accessing capital in the future if this level of interest subsides. Our portfolio companies may generate revenues from the sale of products that are not enabled by nanotechnology. We consider a company to be enabled by nanotechnology or microsystems if a product or products, or intellectual property covering a product or products, that we consider to be at the microscale or smaller is material to its business plan. The core business of some of these companies may not be nanotechnology-enabled products, and, therefore, their success or failure may not be dependent upon the nanotechnology aspects of their business. In addition to developing products that we consider nanotechnology, some of these companies may also develop products that we do not consider enabled by nanotechnology. Some of these companies will generate revenues from the sale of non-nanotechnology-enabled products. Additionally, it is possible that a portfolio company may decide to change its business focus after our initial investment and decide to develop and commercialize non-nanotechnology-enabled products. Risks related to the illiquidity of our investments. We invest in illiquid securities and may not be able to dispose of them when it is advantageous to do so, or ever. Most of our investments are or will be equity or equity-linked securities acquired directly from small companies. These equity securities are generally subject to restrictions on resale or otherwise have no established trading market. The illiquidity of most of our portfolio of equity securities may adversely affect our ability to dispose of these securities at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate these investments. We may never be able to dispose of these securities. 18 Unfavorable regulatory changes could impair our ability to engage in liquidity events. Recent government reforms affecting publicly traded companies, stock markets, investment banks and securities research practices have made it more difficult for privately held companies to complete successful initial public offerings of their equity securities, and such reforms have increased the expense and legal exposure of being a public company. Slowdowns in initial public offerings may also be having an adverse effect on the frequency and prices of acquisitions of privately held companies. A lack of merger and/or acquisition opportunities for privately held companies also may be having an adverse effect on the ability of these companies to raise capital from private sources. Public equity market response to companies offering nanotechnology-enabled products is uncertain. An inability to engage in liquidity events could negatively affect our liquidity, our reinvestment rate in new and follow-on investments and the value of our portfolio. Even if some of our portfolio companies complete initial public offerings, the returns on our investments in those companies would be uncertain. When companies in which we have invested as private entities complete initial public offerings of their securities, these newly issued securities are by definition unseasoned issues. Unseasoned issues tend to be highly volatile and have uncertain liquidity, which may negatively affect their price. In addition, we are typically subject to lock-up provisions that prohibit us from selling our investments into the public market for specified periods of time after initial public offerings. The market price of securities that we hold may decline substantially before we are able to sell these securities. Most initial public offerings of technology companies in the United States are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. Government reforms of the Nasdaq Global Market have made market-making by broker-dealers less profitable, which has caused broker-dealers to reduce their market-making activities, thereby making the market for unseasoned stocks less liquid than they might be otherwise. Risks related to our Company. Our business may be adversely affected by the recent financial crisis and our ability to access the capital markets. The global financial markets are in turmoil, and the economies of the U.S. and many other countries are in recession, which may be severe and prolonged. This status results in severely diminished opportunities for liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about overall economic stability, and there can be no assurance against further decline. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of this global financial turmoil, and if the current uncertainty continues or economic conditions further deteriorate, our business and the business of our portfolio companies could be materially and adversely affected. 19 Our business and results of operations could be impacted adversely by a number of follow-on effects of the financial crisis, including the inability of our portfolio companies to obtain sufficient financing to continue to operate as a going concern, an increase in our funding costs or the limitation on our access to the capital markets. A prolonged period of market illiquidity may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our nonperforming assets are likely to increase, and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. These events could limit our investment activity, limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results. The financial crisis and changes in regulations of the financial industry have adversely affected coverage of us by financial analysts. A number of analysts that have covered us in the past are no longer able to continue to do so owing to changes in employment, to restrictions on the size of companies they are allowed to cover and/or their firms have shut down operations. An inability to attract analyst coverage may adversely affect our ability to raise capital from investors, particularly institutional investors. Our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, may adversely affect our future financial performance. The inability to obtain adequate financing capital sources could force us to seek debt financing, self-fund strategic initiatives or even forgo certain opportunities, which in turn could potentially harm our current and future performance. Because there is generally no established market in which to value our investments, our Valuation Committee’s value determinations may differ materially from the values that a ready market or third party would attribute to these investments. There is generally no public market for the private equity securities in which we invest. Pursuant to the requirements of the 1940 Act, we value all of the private equity securities in our portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by a committee of independent members of our Board of Directors, which we call the Valuation Committee, pursuant to Valuation Procedures established by the Board of Directors. Determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment pursuant to specified valuation principles and processes. We are required by the 1940 Act to value specifically each individual investment on a quarterly basis and record unrealized depreciation for an investment that we believe has become impaired. Conversely, we must record unrealized appreciation if we believe that a security has appreciated in value. Our valuations, although stated as a precise number, are necessarily within a range of values that vary depending on the significance attributed to the various factors being considered. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of warrants held in our portfolio. Option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes-Merton model, require the use of subjective input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, expected dividend rate, and expected risk-free rate of return. In the Black-Scholes-Merton model, variations in the expected volatility or expected term assumptions have a significant impact on fair value. Because the securities underlying the warrants in our portfolio are not publicly traded, many of the required input assumptions are more difficult to estimate than they would be if a public market for the underlying securities existed. 20 Without a readily ascertainable market value and because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the fair value that we assign to our investments may differ from the values that would have been used had an efficient market existed for the investments, and the difference could be material. Any changes in fair value are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as a change in the "Net (decrease) increase in unrealized appreciation on investments." In the venture capital industry, even when a portfolio of early-stage, high-technology venture capital investments proves to be profitable over the portfolio's lifetime, it is common for the portfolio's value to undergo a so-called "J-curve" valuation pattern. This means that when reflected on a graph, the portfolio’s valuation would appear in the shape of the letter "J," declining from the initial valuation prior to increasing in valuation. This J-curve valuation pattern results from write-downs and write-offs of portfolio investments that appear to be unsuccessful, prior to write-ups for portfolio investments that prove to be successful. Because early-stage companies typically have negative cash flow and are by their nature inherently fragile, a valuation process can more readily substantiate a loss of value than an increase in value. Even if our venture capital investments prove to be profitable in the long run, such J-curve valuation patterns could have a significant adverse effect on our net asset value per share and the value of our common stock in the interim. Over time, as we continue to make additional nanotechnology investments, this J-curve pattern may be less relevant for our portfolio as a whole, because the individual J-curves for each investment, or series of investments, may overlap with previous investments at different stages of their J-curves. Changes in valuations of our privately held, early stage companies tend to be more volatile than changes in prices of publicly traded securities. Investments in privately held, early-stage companies are inherently more volatile than investments in more mature businesses. Such immature businesses are inherently fragile and easily affected by both internal and external forces. Our investee companies can lose much or all of their value suddenly in response to an internal or external adverse event. Conversely, these immature businesses can gain suddenly in value in response to an internal or external positive development. Moreover, because our ownership interests in such investments are generally valued only at quarterly intervals by our Valuation Committee, a committee made up of all of the independent members of our Board of Directors, changes in valuations from one valuation point to another tend to be larger than changes in valuations of marketable securities which are revalued in the marketplace much more frequently, in some highly liquid cases, virtually continuously. Information pertinent to our portfolio companies is not always known immediately by us, and, therefore, its availability for use in determining value may not always coincide with the timeframe of our valuations required by the federal securities laws. 21 We expect to continue to experience material write-downs of securities of portfolio companies. Write-downs of securities of our privately held companies have always been a by-product and risk of our business. We expect to continue to experience material write-downs of securities of privately held portfolio companies. Write-downs of such companies occur at all stages of their development. Such write-downs may increase in dollar terms, frequency and as a percentage of our net asset value as our dollar investment activity in privately held companies continues to increase, and the number of such holdings in our portfolio continues to grow. Because the average size of each of our investments in nanotechnology has increased from year to year and continues to increase, the average size of our write-downs may also increase. Because we do not choose investments based on a strategy of diversification, nor do we rebalance the portfolio should one or more investments increase in value substantially relative to the rest of the portfolio, the value of our portfolio is subject to greater volatility than the value of companies with more broadly diversified investments. We do not choose investments based on a strategy of diversification. We also do not rebalance the portfolio should one of our portfolio companies increase in value substantially relative to the rest of the portfolio. Therefore, the value of our portfolio may be more vulnerable to events affecting a single sector or industry and, therefore, subject to greater volatility than a company that follows a diversification strategy. Accordingly, an investment in our common stock may present greater risk to you than an investment in a diversified company. We are dependent upon key management personnel for future success, and may not be able to retain them. We are dependent upon the diligence and skill of our senior management and other key advisers for the selection, structuring, closing and monitoring of our investments. We utilize lawyers, and we utilize outside consultants, including one of our directors, Lori D. Pressman, to assist us in conducting due diligence when evaluating potential investments. There is generally no publicly available information about the companies in which we invest, and we rely significantly on the diligence of our employees and advisers to obtain information in connection with our investment decisions. Our future success, to a significant extent, depends on the continued service and coordination of our senior management team, particularly on Douglas W. Jamison, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a Managing Director, who was designated by our Board of Directors as the successor to Mr. Harris upon his retirement in his positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as of January 1, 2009; on Daniel B. Wolfe, our President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a Managing Director; on Alexei A. Andreev and Michael A. Janse, each an Executive Vice President and Managing Director; and on Sandra M. Forman, our General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Director of Human Resources. The departure of any of our executive officers, key employees or advisers could materially adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy. We do not maintain for our benefit any key-man life insurance on any of our officers or employees. 22 We will need to hire additional employees as the size of our portfolio increases. We anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add investment professionals with expertise in venture capital and/or nanotechnology and administrative and support staff to accommodate the increasing size of our portfolio. We may need to provide additional scientific, business, accounting, legal or investment training for our hires. There is competition for highly qualified personnel. We may not be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain highly qualified personnel because the expenses that we incur as a heavily regulated, publicly held company preclude our paying as high a percentage of our total expenses in cash compensation for employees as the private partnerships with which we compete. Although we have the advantage of offering equity incentive compensation, unlike those private partnerships, we cannot permit co-investment in our investments by our employees, and we cannot give our employees 20 percent or higher carried interests in our investments as incentive compensation taxable as long-term capital gains. The market for venture capital investments, including nanotechnology investments, is highly competitive. We face substantial competition in our investing activities from many competitors, including but not limited to: private venture capital funds; investment affiliates of large industrial, technology, service and financial companies; small business investment companies; hedge funds; wealthy individuals; and foreign investors. Our most significant competitors typically have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Greater financial resources are particularly advantageous in securing lead investor roles in venture capital syndicates. Lead investors typically negotiate the terms and conditions of such financings. Many sources of funding compete for a small number of attractive investment opportunities. Hence, we face substantial competition in sourcing good investment opportunities on terms of investment that are commercially attractive. In addition to the difficulty of finding attractive investment opportunities, our status as a regulated business development company may hinder our ability to participate in investment opportunities or to protect the value of existing investments. We are required to disclose on a quarterly basis the names and business descriptions of our portfolio companies and the type and value of our portfolio securities. Most of our competitors are not subject to these disclosure requirements. Our obligation to disclose this information could hinder our ability to invest in some portfolio companies. Additionally, other current and future regulations may make us less attractive as a potential investor than a competitor not subject to the same regulations. Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio. Following an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as "follow-on" investments, in order to: (1) increase or maintain in whole or in part our ownership percentage; (2) exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing; or (3) attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment. 23 We may elect not to make follow-on investments or lack sufficient funds to make such investments. We have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. The failure to make a follow-on investment may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation, or may cause us to lose some or all preferred rights pursuant to "pay-to-play" provisions that have become common in venture capital transactions. These provisions require proportionate investment in subsequent rounds of financing in order to preserve preferred rights such as anti-dilution protection, liquidation preferences and preemptive rights to invest in future rounds of financing. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk, because we prefer other opportunities or because we are inhibited by compliance with business development company requirements or the desire to maintain our tax status. Bank borrowing or the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock by us, to fund investments in portfolio companies or to fund our operating expenses, would make our total return to common shareholders more volatile. Use of debt or preferred stock as a source of capital entails two primary risks. The first is the risk of leverage, which is the use of debt to increase the pool of capital available for investment purposes. The use of debt leverages our available common equity capital, magnifying the impact on net asset value of changes in the value of our investment portfolio. For example, a business development company that uses 33 percent leverage (that is, $50 of leverage per $100 of common equity) will show a 1.5 percent increase or decline in net asset value for each 1 percent increase or decline in the value of its total assets. The second risk is that the cost of debt or preferred stock financing may exceed the return on the assets the proceeds are used to acquire, thereby diminishing rather than enhancing the return to common shareholders. If we issue preferred shares or debt, the common shareholders would bear the cost of this leverage. To the extent that we utilize debt or preferred stock financing for any purpose, these two risks would likely make our total return to common shareholders more volatile. In addition, we might be required to sell investments, in order to meet dividend, interest or principal payments, when it might be disadvantageous for us to do so. As provided in the 1940 Act and subject to some exceptions, we can issue debt or preferred stock so long as our total assets immediately after the issuance, less some ordinary course liabilities, exceed 200 percent of the sum of the debt and any preferred stock outstanding. The debt or preferred stock may be convertible in accordance with SEC guidelines, which might permit us to obtain leverage at more attractive rates. The requirement under the 1940 Act to pay, in full, dividends on preferred shares or interest on debt before any dividends may be paid on our common stock means that dividends on our common stock from earnings may be reduced or eliminated. An inability to pay dividends on our common stock could conceivably result in our ceasing to qualify as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Code, which would in most circumstances be materially adverse to the holders of our common stock. As of the date hereof, we do not have any debt or preferred stock outstanding. 24 We are authorized to issue preferred stock, which would convey special rights and privileges to its owners senior to those of common stock shareholders. We are currently authorized to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, under terms and conditions determined by our Board of Directors. These shares would have a preference over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation. The statutory class voting rights of any preferred shares we would issue could make it more difficult for us to take some actions that might, in the future, be proposed by the Board and/or holders of common stock, such as a merger, exchange of securities, liquidation or alteration of the rights of a class of our securities, if these actions were perceived by the holders of the preferred shares as not in their best interests. The issuance of preferred shares convertible into shares of common stock might also reduce the net income and net asset value per share of our common stock upon conversion. Loss of status as a RIC would reduce our net asset value and distributable income. We currently intend to qualify as a RIC for 2009 under the Code. As a RIC, we do not have to pay federal income taxes on our income (including realized gains) that is distributed to our shareholders. Accordingly, we are not permitted under accounting rules to establish reserves for taxes on our unrealized capital gains. If we failed to qualify for RIC status in 2009 or beyond, to the extent that we had unrealized gains, we would have to establish reserves for taxes, which would reduce our net asset value, accordingly. In addition, if we, as a RIC, were to decide to make a deemed distribution of net realized capital gains and retain the net realized capital gains, we would have to establish appropriate reserves for taxes that we would have to pay on behalf of shareholders. It is possible that establishing reserves for taxes could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. We operate in a heavily regulated environment, and changes to, or non-compliance with, regulations and laws could harm our business. We are subject to substantive SEC regulations as a BDC. Securities and tax laws and regulations governing our activities may change in ways adverse to our and our shareholders’ interests, and interpretations of these laws and regulations may change with unpredictable consequences. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern our business could have an adverse impact on us or on our operations. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, valuation and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations, new federal accounting standards and Nasdaq Stock Market rules, are creating additional expense and uncertainty for publicly held companies in general, and for BDCs in particular. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases because of their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time, which may well result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have and will continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. 25 Moreover, even though BDCs are not mutual funds, they must comply with several of the regulations applicable to mutual funds, such as the requirement for the implementation of a comprehensive compliance program and the appointment of a Chief Compliance Officer. Further, our Board members, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified Board members and executive officers, which could harm our business, and we have significantly increased both our coverage under, and the related expense for, directors' and officers' liability insurance. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, our reputation may be harmed. Also, as business and financial practices continue to evolve, they may render the regulations under which we operate less appropriate and more burdensome than they were when originally imposed. This increased regulatory burden is causing us to incur significant additional expenses and is time consuming for our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Market prices of our common stock will continue to be volatile. We expect that the market price of our common stock price will continue to be volatile. The price of the common stock may be higher or lower than the price you pay for your shares, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include the following: • stock market and capital markets conditions; • internal developments in our Company with respect to our personnel, financial condition and compliance with all applicable regulations; • announcements regarding any of our portfolio companies; • announcements regarding developments in the nanotechnology or cleantech-related fields in general; • environmental and health concerns regarding nanotechnology, whether real or perceptual; • announcements regarding government funding and initiatives related to the development of nanotechnology or cleantech-related products; • general economic conditions and trends; and/or • departures of key personnel. 26 We will not have control over many of these factors, but expect that our stock price may be influenced by them. As a result, our stock price may be volatile, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Quarterly results fluctuate and are not indicative of future quarterly performance. Our quarterly operating results fluctuate as a result of a number of factors. These factors include, among others, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we and our portfolio companies encounter competition in our markets and general economic and capital markets conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any one quarter should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future quarters. To the extent that we do not realize income or choose not to retain after-tax realized capital gains, we will have a greater need for additional capital to fund our investments and operating expenses. As a RIC, we must annually distribute at least 90 percent of our investment company taxable income as a dividend and may either distribute or retain our realized net capital gains from investments. As a result, these earnings may not be available to fund investments. If we fail to generate net realized capital gains or to obtain funds from outside sources, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to make follow-on and new investments. Because of the structure and objectives of our business, we generally expect to experience net operating losses and rely on proceeds from sales of investments, rather than on investment income, to defray a significant portion of our operating expenses. These sales are unpredictable and may not occur. In addition, as a BDC, we are generally required to maintain a ratio of at least 200 percent of total assets to total borrowings and preferred stock, which may restrict our ability to borrow to fund these requirements. Lack of capital could curtail our investment activities or impair our working capital. Investment in foreign securities could result in additional risks. We may invest in foreign securities, and we currently have one investment in a foreign security. When we invest in securities of foreign issuers, we may be subject to risks not usually associated with owning securities of U.S. issuers. These risks can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, foreign currency exchange controls, social, political and economic instability, differences in securities regulation and trading, expropriation or nationalization of assets and foreign taxation issues. In addition, changes in government administrations or economic or monetary policies in the United States or abroad could result in appreciation or depreciation of our securities and could favorably or unfavorably affect our operations. It may also be more difficult to obtain and enforce a judgment against a foreign issuer. Any foreign investments made by us must be made in compliance with U.S. and foreign currency restrictions and tax laws restricting the amounts and types of foreign investments. 27 Although most of our investments are denominated in U.S. dollars, our investments that are denominated in a foreign currency are subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency may change in relation to the U.S. dollar, in which currency we maintain financial statements and valuations. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. Investing in our stock is highly speculative and an investor could lose some or all of the amount invested. Our investment objective and strategies result in a high degree of risk in our investments and may result in losses in the value of our investment portfolio. Our investments in portfolio companies are highly speculative and, therefore, an investor in our common stock may lose his or her entire investment. The value of our common stock may decline and may be affected by numerous market conditions, which could result in the loss of some or all of the amount invested in our common stock. The securities markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect market prices for securities of companies in general, and technology and very small capitalization companies in particular. Because of our focus on the technology and very small capitalization sectors, and because we are a very small capitalization company ourselves, our stock price is especially likely to be affected by these market conditions. General economic conditions, and general conditions in nanotechnology and in the semi-conductor and information technology, life sciences, materials science and other high technology industries, including cleantech, may also affect the price of our common stock. Our shares might trade at discounts from net asset value or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term. Shares of BDCs like us may, during some periods, trade at prices higher than their net asset value and during other periods, as frequently occurs with closed-end investment companies, trade at prices lower than their net asset value. The possibility that our shares will trade at discounts from net asset value or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term are risks separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share will decrease. The risk of purchasing shares of a BDC that might trade at a discount or unsustainable premium is more pronounced for investors who wish to sell their shares in a relatively short period of time because, for those investors, realization of a gain or loss on their investments is likely to be more dependent upon changes in premium or discount levels than upon increases or decreases in net asset value per share. Our common stock may not trade at a price higher than or equal to net asset value per share. On December 31, 2008, our stock closed at $3.95 per share, a discount of $0.29 to our net asset value per share of $4.24 as of December 31, 2008. 28 The Board of Directors intends to grant stock options to our employees pursuant to the Company's Equity Incentive Plan. When exercised, these options may have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. In accordance with the Company’s Equity Incentive Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors may grant options from time to time for up to 20 percent of the total shares of stock issued and outstanding. When options are exercised, net asset value per share will decrease if the net asset value per share at the time of exercise is higher than the exercise price. Alternatively, net asset value per share will increase if the net asset value per share at the time of exercise is lower than the exercise price. Therefore, existing shareholders will be diluted if the net asset value per share at the time of exercise is higher than the exercise price of the options. Even though issuance of shares pursuant to exercises of options increases the Company's capital, and regardless of whether such issuance results in increases or decreases in net asset value per share, such issuance results in existing shareholders owning a smaller percentage of the shares outstanding.
