risk factors and all other information contained in this Report. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks. 34 Table of Contents We are subject to various regulatory requirements and certain supervisory action by bank regulatory authorities, and on May 6, 2011, the Bank entered into an MOU with the California DFI and the FDIC that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and the market price of our Common Stock. Lack of compliance could result in additional actions by regulators. Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, the California DFI, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board have authority to compel or restrict certain actions if the Bank's or our capital should fall below adequate capital standards as a result of operating losses, or if such regulators otherwise determine that we or the Bank has insufficient capital or the Bank is otherwise operating in an unsafe and unsound manner. On May 6, 2011, the Bank entered into the MOU with the FDIC and the California DFI. Under the terms of the MOU, the Bank is required to take actions required by the MOU within certain specified time frames. Some of the most significant requirements of the MOU require the Bank to reduce its classified assets (not covered by the FDIC loss-share agreements), as specified by the FDIC, as a percentage of Tier 1 leverage capital plus reserves to no more than 50% and to maintain a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 10%. In addition, the Bank may not declare or pay any cash dividends to Wilshire Bancorp without the prior written approval of the FDIC and the California DFI. If the Bank is unable to comply with the requirements of the MOU, the FDIC and the California DFI could take additional actions, including initiating formal enforcement actions, which would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, the FDIC has the power to deem the Bank to be only "adequately capitalized" even though its capital ratios meet the well capitalized standard. In such event, the Bank would be prohibited from using brokered deposits, which have been a source of funds for us in recent years, and rates on deposits would be limited to market rates determined by the FDIC, potentially adversely affecting our liquidity. The terms of any such corrective action could have a material negative effect on our business, our financial condition and the market price of our Common Stock. We are also subject to an MOU with the Reserve Bank which requires us to take certain actions. On June 29, 2011, Wilshire Bancorp entered into an MOU with its primary federal regulator, the Reserve Bank. The MOU is designed to enhance our holding company's ability to act as a source of strength to the Bank. Under the MOU, we are required to obtain Reserve Bank approval before taking certain actions, such as declaring or paying any dividends, including dividends to be paid to the U.S. Treasury under TARP; taking dividends or any other form of payment representing a reduction in capital from the bank; making any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities; directly or indirectly, incurring, increasing or guaranteeing any debt, and; directly or indirectly, purchasing or redeeming any shares of our stock. Additionally, we agreed to comply with certain notice provisions when appointing any new director or senior executive officer, or changing the responsibilities of any senior executive officer so that the officer would assume a different senior executive officer position. We have taken action and intend to take such further action as may be necessary to comply with the requirements of the MOU; however, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of the MOU, the Reserve Bank could take additional actions, including initiating formal enforcement actions, which would have an adverse effect on our business. We are subject to a pending derivative lawsuit and may become subject to governmental inquiries, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and the market price of our Common Stock. Wilshire Bancorp, and certain of our current and former officers and directors were recently named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit alleging among other things, breaches of fiduciary duty laws, as described in "Legal Proceedings," Part I Item 3 of this report. We are unable, at this time, to estimate our potential liability in this matter, and we may be required to pay judgments, 35 Table of Contents settlements, fines penalties, injunctions or other relief in amounts which may be material, and to incur costs and expenses in connection with the defense of this lawsuit. We regularly review our litigation reserves for adequacy considering our litigation risks and probability of incurring losses related to litigation. However, given the preliminary status of this foregoing, we are not able to assess the likelihood or amount of any liability that may be imposed and, accordingly, we do not have a reserve in respect of this litigation. We cannot be certain that our current litigation reserves will be adequate over time to cover our losses in this and other litigation due to higher than anticipated settlement costs, prolonged litigation, adverse judgments, or other factors that are largely outside of our control. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover our losses in the litigation or any investigation that may arise relating to the facts at issue in the litigation. If our litigation reserves and insurance coverage are not adequate, our business, financial condition, including our liquidity and capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, in the future, we may increase our litigation reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital and results of operations. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has requested information regarding the internal investigation and the adjustment to the Company's allowance for loan losses ("ALLL") and provision for loan losses. The Company is providing this information and cooperating fully with the SEC's inquiry. We are unable to predict at this time the outcome of such inquiry, and we may become subject to possible administrative or enforcement actions from the SEC as a result. We expect the derivative lawsuit and any governmental inquiries that may arise to be time-consuming, and they may divert management's attention and resources from our ordinary business operations. Claims asserted against our Company, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and the market price of our Common Stock. We previously reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and determined that our internal controls and procedures were not effective as of the fiscal year end December 31, 2010. If we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures, our financial results may not be accurately reported. We conducted an internal investigation with the assistance of outside independent professional firms and our internal audit department. As a result of the investigation, management discovered a deficiency in the operating effectiveness of loan underwriting, approval and renewal processes for those loan originations and asset sales associated with our former senior marketing officer. Specifically, these processes lacked effective supervision and oversight, by the former Chief Executive Officer, and the procedures and requirements associated with loan underwriting, approvals, renewals, and sales were not properly executed or enforced. Following the fourth quarter of 2010, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 and determined that these control deficiencies, combined with the material adjustment to Wilshire Bancorp's allowance for loan loss and related provision for loan losses discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, constituted a material weakness in Wilshire Bancorp's internal control over financial reporting, as described in "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or otherwise ineffective internal and disclosure controls could negatively affect our business, the price of our Common Stock, and market confidence in our reported financial information. 36 Table of Contents If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal and disclosure controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities. Effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We continually review and analyze our internal control over financial reporting for Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. As part of that process we discovered material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control and disclosed the weakness in Controls and Procedures. Material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis. Significant deficiency is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for the oversight of the Company's financial reporting. As a result of weaknesses that may be identified in our internal control, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation. If we discover weaknesses, we will make efforts to improve our internal and disclosure control. However, we may not be successful in such improvements. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect our ability to remain listed with The NASDAQ Global Select Market. Ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities. If a significant number of clients fail to perform under their loans, our business, profitability, and financial condition would be adversely affected. As a lender, one of the largest risks we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses, it could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and financial condition. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Although this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment. Although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in our loan portfolio, we may find it necessary to further increase the allowance for loan losses or our regulators may require us to increase this allowance. Increases in the level of non-performing loans could adversely affect our business, profitability, and financial condition. Increase in non-performing loans could have an adverse effect on our earnings as a result of related increases in our provisions for loan losses, charge-offs, and other losses related to non-performing loans. The increase in non-performing loans and resulting decline in earnings could deplete our capital, leaving the Company undercapitalized. Non-performing loans for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $43.8 million, a decrease from $71.2 million at the end of 2010, and $70.8 million at the end of 2009. Delinquent loans, or loans still accruing but past due by 30 days or more, totaled $15.5 million at December 31, 2011, representing a decrease of $19.0 million, or 55.1%, from December 31, 2010. The decrease in non-performing and delinquent loans from 2010 to 2011 was 37 Table of Contents a result of management's plan to aggressively reduce problem assets through sales and charge-offs in 2010 and 2011. Increases in our allowance for loan losses could materially affect our earnings adversely. Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. Our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. However, actual loan losses could increase significantly as the result of changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which are generally beyond our control. In addition, actual loan losses could increase significantly as a result of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. Thus, such losses could exceed our current allowance estimates. Either of these occurrences could materially affect our earnings adversely. In addition, the FDIC and the DFI, as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for losses on loans and loan commitments or to recognize further loan charge-offs, based upon judgments different from those of management. Any increase in our allowance required by the FDIC or the DFI could adversely affect us. Banking organizations are subject to interest rate risk and changes in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance. A major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans we extend to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. In addition, loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans, and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations. Because of the declining national economy and continued financial crisis, the credit markets are lacking liquidity. While the federal funds rate and other short-term market interest rates decreased substantially, the intermediate and long-term market interest rates, which are used by many banking organizations to guide loan pricing, have not decreased proportionately. This has led to a "steepening" of the market yield curve with short-term rates considerably lower than long-term notes. We may not be able to minimize our interest rate risk. In addition, while a decrease in the general level of interest rates may improve the ability of certain borrowers with variable rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations, it reduces our interest income, and may lead to an increase in competition among banks for deposits. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, net interest margin and our overall profitability. Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations, meet our obligations as they become due and jeopardize our financial condition. Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations, meet our obligations as they become due and jeopardize our financial condition. Liquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that the Bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business 38 Table of Contents activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against us. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Although management has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions, any substantial, unexpected and/or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The profitability of Wilshire Bancorp is dependent on the profitability of the Bank. Because Wilshire Bancorp's principal activity is to act as the holding company of the Bank, the profitability of Wilshire Bancorp is largely dependent on the profitability of the Bank. The Bank operates in an extremely competitive banking environment, competing with a number of banks and other financial institutions which possess greater financial resources than those available to the Bank, in addition to other independent banks. In addition, the banking business is affected by general economic and political conditions, both domestic and international, and by government monetary and fiscal policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, high interest rates, short money supply, scarce natural resources, international terrorism and other disorders as well as other factors beyond the control of the Bank may adversely affect its profitability. Banks are also subject to extensive governmental supervision, regulation and control, and future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the banking industry and the operations of the Bank. Wilshire Bancorp relies heavily on the payment of dividends from the Bank. The Bank is the only source of significant income for Wilshire Bancorp. Accordingly, the ability of Wilshire Bancorp to meet its debt service requirements and to pay dividends, if permissible, depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to it. However, the Bank is subject to regulations limiting the amount of dividends that it may pay to Wilshire Bancorp. For example, any payment of dividends by the Bank is subject to the FDIC's capital adequacy guidelines. All banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8.00%, at least one-half of which must be in the form of Tier 1 capital, and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average adjusted assets of 4.00%. If (i) the FDIC increases any of these required ratios; (ii) the total of risk-weighted assets of the Bank increases significantly; and/or (iii) the Bank's income decreases significantly, the Bank's Board of Directors may decide or be required to retain a greater portion of the Bank's earnings to achieve and maintain the required capital or asset ratios. This will reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the Bank to Wilshire Bancorp. Further, in some cases, the FDIC could take the position that it has the power to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its view, such payments would constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Moreover, the Bank's MOU prohibits the payment of dividends to Wilshire Bancorp without the prior approval of the FDIC and California DFI In addition, whether dividends are paid and their frequency and amount will depend on the financial condition and performance, and the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Bank. The foregoing restrictions on dividends paid by the Bank may limit Wilshire Bancorp's ability to obtain funds from such dividends for its cash needs, including funds for payment of its debt service requirements and operating expenses and for payment of cash dividends to Wilshire Bancorp's shareholders. The amount of dividends the Bank could pay to Wilshire Bancorp as of December 31, 2011 without prior regulatory approval, which is limited by statute to the sum of undivided profits for the current year plus net profits for the preceding two years (less any distributions made to shareholders during such periods), was zero as undivided cumulative three year net income was negative, and therefore no dividends can be paid without regulatory approval. If such approval is 39 Table of Contents withheld, the inability of Wilshire Bancorp to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial condition. The holders of our debentures and Series A Preferred Stock have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders. In December 2002, the Bank issued an aggregate of $10 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures, at times referred to in this Report as the 2002 Junior Subordinated Debentures or the 2002 debentures. In addition, Wilshire Bancorp, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank in 2003 and as a parent company of the Bank in 2005 and 2007, issued an aggregate of $77,321,000 of Junior Subordinated Debentures as part of the issuance of $75,000,000 in trust preferred securities by statutory trusts wholly-owned by Wilshire Bancorp. The purpose of these transactions was to raise additional capital. These Junior Subordinated Debentures are senior in liquidation rights to our outstanding shares of common stock and our Series A Preferred Stock. The terms of these Junior Subordinated Debentures also restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock at any time we are in default under, or with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debentures issued in 2003, 2005 or 2007, have exercised our right to defer interest payments under the indentures governing these Junior Subordinated Debentures. As a result, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holder of these Junior Subordinated Debentures must be paid in full before any liquidating distributions may be made to the holders of our common and preferred stock. The 2002 debentures mature in December 2012. If we default under the terms of these Junior Subordinated Debentures or utilize our right to defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Debentures issued in 2003, 2005 or 2007, no dividends may be paid to holders of our common and preferred stock for so long as we remain in default or have deferred amounts remaining unpaid. On December 12, 2008, the Company issued $62,158,000 in Series A Preferred Stock and a warrant to the U.S. Treasury as part of the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program or "CPP". This $62.2 million investment from the U.S. Treasury, which is commonly referred to as Troubled Assets Relief Program ("TARP") investment, was part of the government strategy to counter the ongoing financial crisis and the possible prolonged economic downturn. The TARP investment was made to us in exchange for our 62,158 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase initially 949,460 shares of our common stock. The preferred shareholder, the U.S. Treasury, has preference with respect to dividends and liquidation over our common shareholders. Similar to the Junior Subordinated Debentures, if we default the payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock for so long as we remain in default or have deferred amounts remaining unpaid. Because we are substantially dependent on dividends from the Bank in order to make the periodic payments due under the terms of the Junior Subordinated Debentures issued in 2003, 2005 and 2007, and the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock issued in 2008, in the event that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Wilshire Bancorp for any significant period of time, then we may be unable to pay the amounts due to the holders of these Junior Subordinated Debentures and the U.S. Treasury. Currently, the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company without prior regulatory approval. If such approval is withheld, then the Company may not have sufficient funds with which to pay the amounts due to the holders of the Junior Subordinated Debentures and the U.S. Treasury. Income that we recognized and continue to recognize in connection with our 2009 FDIC-assisted Mirae Bank acquisition may be non-recurring or finite in duration. On June 26, 2009, we acquired the banking operations of Mirae Bank from the FDIC. Through the acquisition, we acquired approximately $395.6 million of assets and assumed $374.0 million of liabilities. The Mirae Bank acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and we recorded a bargain purchase gain totaling $21.7 million as a result of the acquisition. This gain was 40 Table of Contents included as a component of noninterest income on our statement of income for 2009. The amount of the gain was equal to the amount by which the fair value of assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities. The bargain purchase gain resulting from the acquisition was a one-time, extraordinary gain that is not expected to be repeated in future periods. In addition, the loans that we acquired from Mirae Bank were acquired at a $54.9 million discount. This discount is amortized and accreted to interest income on a monthly basis. However, as these loans are paid-off, charged-off, sold, or transferred to non-accrual status, the income from the discount accretion is reduced. As the acquired loans are removed from our books, the related discount will no longer be available for accretion into income. During 2010, accretion of $4.0 million on loans purchased at a discount was recorded as interest income. During 2011, accretion of $2.4 million was recorded as interest income. As of December 31, 2011, the balance of the carrying value of our discount on loans was $7.0 million, which declined by $6.6 million from its carrying value of $13.6 million as of December 31, 2010 and by $47.9 million from its initial value of $54.9 million. We expect the continued reduction of discount accretion recorded as interest income in future quarters. Our decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired, including the FDIC loss sharing assets, could be different than initially estimated which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. We acquired significant portfolios of loans in the Mirae Bank acquisition. Although these loans were marked down to their estimated fair value, the acquired loans may suffer further deterioration in value resulting in additional charge-offs. The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of charge-offs in the loan portfolio that we acquired from Mirae Bank and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition, even if other favorable events occur. Although we have entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC which provide that a significant portion of losses related to the assets acquired from Mirae Bank will be borne by the FDIC, we are not protected for all losses resulting from charge-offs with respect to those assets. Additionally, the loss sharing agreements have limited terms. Therefore, any charge-off of related losses that we experience after the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively impact our net income. Our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral. In considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of an appraisal. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the value of collateral backing a loan may be less than supposed, and if a default occurs, we may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan. We are subject to environmental risks associated with owning real estate or collateral. The cost of cleaning up or paying damages and penalties associated with environmental problems could increase our operating expenses. When a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property, the Bank may purchase the property in foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower. We may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. We may also own and lease premises where branches and other facilities are located. While we will have lending, foreclosure and facilities guidelines intended to exclude properties 41 Table of Contents with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the Bank may own, manage or occupy. We face the risk that environmental laws could force us to clean up the properties at the Company's expense. It may cost much more to clean a property than the property is worth. We could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower's operations if the Bank takes a role in managing those operations after a default. The Bank may also find it difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties. Our ability to obtain reimbursement under the loss sharing agreement on covered assets depends on our compliance with the terms of the loss sharing agreement. The Company must certify to the FDIC on a quarterly basis our compliance with the terms of the FDIC loss sharing agreement as a prerequisite to obtaining reimbursement from the FDIC for realized losses on covered assets. The required terms of the agreement are extensive and failure to comply with any of the guidelines could result in a specific asset or group of assets permanently losing their loss sharing coverage. As of June 30, 2009, $235.6 million, or 6.86%, of the Company's assets were covered by the FDIC loss sharing agreement compared to $165.5 million or 6.14% as of December 31, 2011. We may not be able to manage the covered assets in such a way as to always maintain loss share coverage on all such assets, which may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions, especially in California, could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, and profitability. If economic conditions worsen in the domestic or global economy, especially in California, our business, growth and profitability are likely to be materially adversely affected. A substantial number of our clients are geographically concentrated in California, and adverse economic conditions in California, particularly in the Los Angeles area, could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number of our clients. To the extent that our clients' underlying businesses are harmed, they are more likely to default on their loans. The conditions in the California economy and in the economies of other areas where we operate may deteriorate further in the future and such deterioration may adversely affect us. Continuing negative developments in the financial industry and U.S. and global credit markets may affect our operations and results. Negative developments in the U.S. financial market, its real estate section, and the securitization markets for the mortgage loans have resulted in uncertainty in the overall economy both domestically and globally. Commercial as well as consumer loan portfolio performances have deteriorated at many institutions and the competition for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have substantially declined and may continue to further decline. Bank and bank holding company stock prices generally have been negatively affected as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years. 2009 was a record year for bankruptcies and bank failures. As a result, there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders. Negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments could negatively affect our operations by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and adversely affect our financial performance. 42 Table of Contents The effect of the U.S. Government's response to the financial crisis remains uncertain. In response to the turmoil in the financial services sector and the severe recession in the broader economy, the U.S. Government has taken legislative and other action intended to restore financial stability and economic growth. On October 3, 2008, then President Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the "EESA"). Among other things, the EESA established the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Under TARP, the United States Treasury Department (the "Treasury Department") was given the authority, among other things, to purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions and others for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. On October 14, 2008, the Treasury Department announced a program under EESA pursuant to which it would make senior preferred stock investments in qualifying financial institutions (the "TARP Capital Purchase Program"). On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "ARRA"). The ARRA contained, among other things, a further package of economic stimulus measures and amendments to EESA's restrictions on compensation of executives of financial institutions and others participating in the TARP. In addition to legislation, the Federal Reserve Board eased short-term interest rates and implemented a series of emergency programs to furnish liquidity to the financial markets and credit to various participants in those markets. The FDIC created a program to guarantee, on specified conditions, certain indebtedness and noninterest-bearing transaction accounts of participating insured depository institutions for limited periods. After permitting some of its emergency programs to lapse during the first half of the year, in November, 2010, the Federal Reserve Board implemented a further program of quantitative easing involving the purchase of an additional $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011. In addition, on December 17, 2010, President Obama signed the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the "2010 Tax Relief Act") which was intended to stimulate the economy. Among other things, the 2010 Tax Relief Act contained two-year extensions of the Bush era tax cuts and of Alternative Minimum Tax relief, a two-percentage point reduction in employee-paid payroll taxes and self-employment tax for 2011, new incentives for investment in machinery and equipment, estate tax relief, and a significant number of tax breaks for individuals and businesses. In addition, on July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act, the most comprehensive reform of the regulation of the financial services industry since the Great Depression of the 1930's. Among many other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for increased supervision of financial institutions by regulatory agencies, more stringent capital requirements for financial institutions, major changes to deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC, heightened regulation of hedging and derivatives activities, a greater focus on consumer protection issues, in part through the formation of a new Consumer Finance Protection Bureau having powers formerly split among different regulatory agencies, extensive changes to the regulation of mortgage lending, imposition of limits on interchange transaction and network fees for electronic debit transactions, repeal of the existing prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits, the effective winding up of additional expenditures of funds under the TARP, and the imposition of a "sunset date" of December 31, 2012 on expenditures under the ARRA. Many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions have delayed effective dates that have not yet occurred, while others require implementing regulations of Federal agencies that have not yet been adopted. There can be no assurance as to the actual impact of the EESA, the ARRA, the 2010 Tax Relief Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and their respective implementing regulations, the programs of the government agencies, or any further legislation or regulations, on the financial markets or the broader economy. A failure to stabilize the financial markets, and a continuation or worsening of the current financial market conditions, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our common stock. 43 Table of Contents The new CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the "Federal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof," with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are "unfair, deceptive, or abusive" in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service ("UDAP authority"). The potential reach of the CFPB's broad new rulemaking powers and UDAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank is currently unknown. The Bank is subject to federal and state and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties. Federal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to the Bank's performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact the Bank's rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact the Bank's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available or may not be on terms acceptable to us when it is needed. We are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. While we believe our existing capital resources at the Bank are sufficient to satisfy the Bank's capital requirements for the foreseeable future and will be sufficient to offset any problem assets. However, should our asset quality erode and require significant additional provision, resulting in consistent net operating losses at the Bank, our capital levels will decline and we will need to raise capital to support the Bank. In addition, we are subject to separate capital requirements and needs at the holding company. While we are in compliance with capital requirements at the holding company, there may be reasons in the future why we would determine to increase our capital levels at the holding company. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to operate in substantially the same manner as we have before, including the payment of dividends at the bank and holding company levels, could be materially impaired. Maintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer demand. There is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including Internet-based services, could require us to make substantial expenditures to 44 Table of Contents modify or adapt our existing products or services. A failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce, or a failure to introduce products that the market may demand, could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability, or growth prospects. Significant reliance on loans secured by real estate may increase our vulnerability to downturns in the California real estate market and other variables impacting the value of real estate. At December 31, 2011, approximately 85.1% of our loans were secured by real estate, a substantial portion of which consist of loans secured by real estate in California. Conditions in the California real estate market historically have influenced the level of our non-performing assets. A real estate recession in Southern California could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, California has experienced, on occasion, significant natural disasters, including earthquakes, brush fires and flooding attributed to the weather phenomenon known as "El Nino." In addition to these catastrophes, California has experienced a moderate decline in housing prices beginning in late 2006. The decline in housing prices subsequently developed into the current financial crisis, characterized by the further decline in the real estate market in many parts of the country, including California, starting in the second half of 2007, and the failures of many financial institutions between 2008 and 2011. The availability of insurance to compensate for losses resulting from such crises is limited. The occurrence of one or more of such crises could impair the value of the collateral for our real estate secured loans and adversely affect us. If we fail to retain our key employees, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. Our future success depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our key management personnel. If we lose the services of one or more key employees within a short period of time, we could be adversely affected. Our future success is also dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for such employees among financial institutions in California is intense. Our inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could adversely affect us. Following the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer, we promoted our previous Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer; and our prior Executive Vice President and SBA Manager, was promoted to Chief Lending Officer. The Company's Chief Marketing Officer was terminated in December 2010, and the position remains open. Effective February 18, 2011, our President and Chief Executive Officer resigned after which a new President and Chief Executive Officer was immediately appointed to the position on the same day. In September 2011, the Company hired a consultant to ultimately fill the position of Chief Credit Officer who went on to formally become the Company's Chief Credit Officer in October of 2011. For as long as we have shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding in connection with the U.S. Treasury's voluntary TARP Capital Purchase Program, we will be subject to the limitations on compensation included in EESA and ARRA. These restrictions may make it more difficult for us to retain certain of our key officers and employees because competitors who are not subject to the same restrictions may be able to offer more competitive salaries and/or benefits to these individuals. More information about the compensation limitations of EESA and AARA can be found in the section entitled "Supervision and RegulationTARP Capital Purchase Program" in Item 1 of this Report. In addition, the Bank and Company entered into MOUs with their primary regulators during 2011, which requires the Bank and the Company to notify the regulators prior to appointing any new executive officers. 45 Table of Contents We could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services. Fear of security breaches could limit the growth of our online services. We offer various internet-based services to our clients, including online banking services. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential to maintain our clients' confidence in our online services. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction data. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test our security, failure to mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and could harm our business. People generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Our ability to provide financial services over the internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit confidential information online. As a result, our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The market for our common stock is limited, and potentially subject to volatile changes in price. The market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuation in response to numerous factors, including variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors, changes by financial research analysts in their evaluation of our financial results or those of our competitors, or our failure or that of our competitors to meet such estimates, conditions in the economy in general or the banking industry in particular, or unfavorable publicity affecting us or the banking industry. In addition, the equity markets have, on occasion, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies' securities and have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. In addition, the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder's holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Further, the issuance or registration by us of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the effect of increasing the number of outstanding shares or, in the case of registrations, the number of shares of our common stock that are freely tradable; any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly. Any such fluctuations may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. We may experience impairment on goodwill. In light of the overall instability of the economy, the continued volatility in the financial markets, the downward pressure on bank stock prices and expectations of financial performance for the banking industry, including the Company, our estimates of goodwill fair value may be subject to change or adjustment and we may determine that impairment charges are necessary. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test performed in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350. The analysis involves comparing the East Coast branches' estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. To measure fair value under the first step, we use a combination of the "Discounted Cash Flow Method", the "Guideline Public Company Method", and the "Guideline Branch Transaction Method" all of which have management estimates and assumptions used to estimate fair value. If management's estimates and assumptions are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner. Goodwill may be written down in future periods. 46 Table of Contents We face substantial competition in our primary market area. We conduct our banking operations primarily in Southern California. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the same banking services that we offer in our service area. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including without limitation, savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits, and range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. We also face competition from out-of-state financial intermediaries that have opened low-end production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue our loan growth and level of deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be adversely affected. Anti-takeover provisions of our charter documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management. Certain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could discourage unsolicited takeover proposals not approved by the Board of Directors in which shareholders could receive a premium for their shares, thereby potentially limiting the opportunity for our shareholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal or may have the effect of permitting our current management, including the current Board of Directors, to retain its position, and place it in a better position to resist changes that shareholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our business. The anti-takeover measures included in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, include, without limitation, the following: the elimination of cumulative voting, the adoption of a classified Board of Directors, super-majority shareholder voting requirements to modify certain provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and restrictions on certain "business combinations" with third parties who may acquire our securities outside of an action taken by us. We are subject to significant government regulation and legislation that increases the cost of doing business and inhibits our ability to compete. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation, all of which is subject to material change from time to time. These laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and have an adverse impact on our ability to compete efficiently with other financial service providers that are not similarly regulated. Changes in regulatory policies or procedures could result in management's determining that a higher provision for loan losses would be necessary and could cause 47 Table of Contents higher loan charge-offs, thus adversely affecting our net earnings. Future regulation or legislation may impose additional requirements and restrictions on us in a manner that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and prospects. As a participant in the TARP Capital Purchase Program, we have agreed to various requirements and restrictions imposed by the U.S. Treasury on all participants, which included a provision that the U. S. Treasury could change the terms of participation at any time. Further information regarding the current requirements and restrictions imposed on TARP participants can be found under the caption "Regulation and SupervisionThe TARP Capital Purchase Program" in Item 1 of this Report. We could be negatively impacted by downturns in the South Korean economy. Many of our customers are locally based Korean-Americans who also conduct business in South Korea. Although we conduct most of our business with locally-based customers and rely on domestically located assets to collateralize our loans and credit arrangements, we have historically had some exposure to the economy of South Korea in connection with certain portions of our loans and credit transactions with Korean banks. Such exposure has consisted of: discounts of acceptances created by banks in South Korea, advances made against clean documents presented under sight letters of credit issued by banks in South Korea, advances made against clean documents held for later presentation under letters of credit issued by banks in South Korea, and extensions of credit to borrowers in the U.S. secured by letters of credit issued by banks in South Korea. We generally enter into any such loan or credit arrangements, in excess of $200,000 and of longer than 120 days, only with the largest of the Korean banks and spread other lesser or shorter term loan or credit arrangements among a variety of medium-sized Korean banks. Management closely monitors our exposure to the South Korean economy and the activities of Korean banks with which we conduct business. To date, we have not experienced any significant loss attributable to our exposure to South Korea. Nevertheless, our efforts to minimize exposure to downturns in the South Korean economy may not be successful in the future, and another significant downturn in the South Korean economy could possibly result in significant credit losses for us. In addition, due to our customer base being largely made up of Korean-Americans, our deposit base could significantly decrease as a result of deterioration in the Korean economy. For example, some of our customers' businesses may rely on funds from South Korea. Further, our customers may temporarily withdraw deposits in order to transfer funds and benefit from gains on foreign exchange and interest rates, and/or to support their relatives in South Korea during downturns in the Korean economy. A significant decrease in our deposits could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additional shares of our common stock issued in the future could have a dilutive effect. Shares of our common stock eligible for future issuance and sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for our stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 80,000,000 shares of common stock. As of February 29, 2012, there were approximately 71,282,518 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, 1,374,150 shares of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock have been granted and are reserved for issuance under the Wilshire Bancorp, Inc. 2008 Stock Option Plan, or the "2008 Stock Option Plan," 949,460 shares of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon exercise of the warrant that we issued to the U.S. 48 Table of Contents Treasury in connection with our participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program, plus an additional 143,920 shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance to the holders of stock options previously granted and still outstanding under the Wilshire State Bank 1997 Stock Option Plan, or the "1997 Stock Option Plan." Thus, approximately 6,592,416 shares of our common stock remain authorized, not reserved for stock options, and available for future issuance and sale at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Shares of our preferred stock previously issued and preferred stock issued in the future could have dilutive and other effects. On December 12, 2008, we received $62,158,000 from the U.S. Treasury as part of the federal government's Capital Purchase Program. In exchange for the federal funding, we issued 62,158 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, each with a stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per share, to the U.S. Treasury. As of February 29, 2012, there were of 62,158 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding. Shares of our preferred stock eligible for future issuance and sale also could have a dilutive effect on the market for the shares of our common stock, especially because of the fact that the preferred shares would have seniority with respect to our common stock. In addition to 80,000,000 shares of common stock, our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2011, the total outlook:\\Personal Folders\Sent Itemsnumber of shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock was 4,937,842. The Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of such preferred shares at any time in the future. If such shares of preferred stock are made convertible into shares of common stock, there could be a dilutive effect on the shares of common stock then outstanding. In addition, shares of preferred stock may be provided a preference over holders of common stock upon our liquidation or with respect to the payment of dividends, in respect of voting rights or in the redemption of our capital stock. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to any series of preferred stock may be determined by resolution of our Board of Directors without the need for shareholder approval.
