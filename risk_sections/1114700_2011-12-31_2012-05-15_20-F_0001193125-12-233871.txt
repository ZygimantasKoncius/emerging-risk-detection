Risk Factors, and with consideration that the Argentine economy has been historically volatile, which has negatively affected the volume and growth of the financial system. Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources LiquidityHolding Company on an Individual Basis We generate our net earnings/losses from our operating subsidiaries, especially Banco Galicia, our main operating subsidiary. Although, from 2002 to 2010 we did not receive any dividends from Banco Galicia, it is the primary source of funds available to us. On April 27, 2011, Banco Galicias shareholders held a shareholders meeting during which they approved the distribution of cash dividends for a total amount of Ps.100.1 million. During May 2011, according to our participation of 94.84%, we received a cash dividend of Ps.94.9 million. Additionally, during 2011, we received from other subsidiaries cash dividends for Ps.38.9 million and Ps.18.8 million during 2010. Banco Galicias dividend-paying ability had been affected since late 2001 by the effects of the 2001-2002 crisis on its liquidity and income-generation capacity. In addition, there were other restrictions on Banco Galicias ability to pay dividends resulting from applicable Argentine Central Bank rules and the loan agreements entered into by Banco Galicia as part of its foreign debt restructuring. See Item 8. Financial Information-Dividend Policy and Dividends. The extent to which a banking subsidiary may extend credit or otherwise provide funds to a holding company is limited by Argentine Central Bank rules. For a description of these rules, see Item 4. Information on the Company-Argentine Banking Regulation-Lending Limits. According to Grupo Financiero Galicias policy for the distribution of dividends and due to the fact that most of the profits for fiscal year 2011 correspond to income by holdings and just a fraction corresponds to the realized and liquid profits meeting the requirements to be distributed as per Section 68 of the Corporations Law, and taking as well into consideration Grupo Financiero Galicias financial condition at the shareholders meeting held on April 19, 2012, our shareholders approved the payment of dividends in cash for Ps.17.8 million, which represents 1.4% for the 1,241,407,017 class A and B ordinary shares with a face value of Ps.1 each. Pursuant to the section incorporated after Section 25 of Act No. 23,966, Grupo Financiero Galicia will receive the reimbursement of tax withholdings related to the taxes paid on behalf of the shareholders subject to tax on personal assets as of December 31, 2011.As of December 31, 2011, Grupo Financiero Galicia, on an individual basis, had cash and due from banks of Ps.0.9 million and short-term investments of Ps.59.4 million. Grupo Financiero Galicias short-term investments were made up of: (i) special current account deposits of Ps.55.9 million and (ii) investments in mutual funds of Ps.3.5 million. As of December 31, 2010, Grupo Financiero Galicia, on an individual basis, had cash and due from banks of Ps.0.8 million and short-term investments of Ps.26.5 million. Grupo Financiero Galicias short-term investments were made up of: (i) special current account deposits of Ps.24.8 million, (ii) time deposits of Ps.0.5 million, and (iii) investments in mutual funds of Ps.1.2 million. As of December 31, 2009, Grupo Financiero Galicia, on an individual basis, had cash and due from banks of Ps.3.8 million and short-term investments of Ps.28.7 million. Grupo Financiero Galicias short-term investments were made up of: (i) special current account deposits of Ps.3.2 million, (ii) time deposits of Ps.10.6 million, (iii) investments in mutual funds of Ps.1.8 million, (iv) notes issued by companies from abroad of Ps.5.6 million, and (v) ETFs of Ps.7.5 million. In July 2007, in exercise of our preemptive rights, we used US$102.2 million of face value of 2014 Notes and cash to subscribe for 93.6 million shares of Banco Galicia, in the offering carried out by Banco Galicia. To fund such cash subscription we entered into an US$80 million loan agreement in July 2007, the first installment of which was repaid in July 2008, for US$24.3 million (US$18.0 million of principal and US$6.3 million in interest). -135- Table of Contents On January 6, 2009, the remaining outstanding of US$62 million was cancelled in advance, with a single and final payment of US$39.1 million, with our own funds and funds from financing granted by local entities. On March 9, 2009, our shareholders held the general ordinary shareholders meeting during which they approved the creation of a global program for simple notes, not convertible into shares, for a maximum principal amount of US$60.0 million. On June 4, 2009 Series I and Series II notes corresponding to the Class I notes were issued in the amount of US$45.0 million. Series I, with a one-year term, was issued for a principal amount of US$34.4 million and a yield of 8%; Series II, with a two-year term, was issued for a principal amount of US$10.6 million and an annual yield of 10.5%. With the proceeds of these issuances, we proceeded to cancel the funding from local entities. On April 14, 2010, Grupo Financiero Galicias shareholders held the ordinary and extraordinary shareholders meeting during which they approved an extension of US$40 million in the amount of the global program of simple short-, medium- and/or long- term notes. Therefore, the maximum amount of the program, which was originally set at US$60.0 million or its equivalent in any other currency, was increased to US$100.0 million or its equivalent in any other currency. Furthermore, during fiscal year 2010 Grupo Financiero Galicia made an offer of notes for a face value of US$45.0 million. The subscription period for such notes ended on June 4, 2010; the notes were fully subscribed for and Grupo Financiero Galicia decided not to issue the Series I notes, which were planned to be issued at a discount. The cut-off rate for the Series II notes was 101.82%, for a face value of US$18.1 million, equivalent to a 7% annual yield. With respect to the Series III notes, the cut-off rate was 101.28%, for a face value of US$26.9 million, equivalent to an 8.5% annual yield. Accordingly, during fiscal year 2010, Grupo Financiero Galicia repaid, upon maturity, the Class I, Series I notes for US$34.4 million. During 2011, Grupo Financiero Galicia repaid, upon maturity, Class I, Series II notes for US$10.6 million. Each of our subsidiaries is responsible for their own liquidity management.

(2) Revised from its original version as mentioned in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. Under Argentine Banking GAAP, our operating activities include the operating results, the origination of loans and other credits to the private sector, as well as raising customer deposits and entering into sales of government securities under repurchase agreement transactions. Our financing activities include issuing bonds in the local and foreign capital markets and borrowing from foreign and local banks and international credit agencies. Our investing activities primarily consist of the acquisition of equity investments and purchasing of bank premises and equipment. Management believes that cash flows from operations and available cash and cash equivalent balances, will be sufficient to fund our financial commitments and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2012. Cash Flows from Operating Activities In fiscal year 2011, net cash provided by operating activities amounted to Ps.457.7 million, due to a Ps.6,219.3 million increase in deposits, corresponding to: (a) an increase of Ps.3,045.6 million in demand deposits and (b) an increase of Ps.3,173.7 million in time deposits, that was partially offset by the increase of Ps.5,012.3 million in loans mainly attributable to our private-sector loan portfolio origination. In addition, net cash was used by other variations in operating assets and liabilities: (i) Ps.245.5 million increase in government and private securities comprised of an increase of Ps.364.5 million in net repurchase agreement transactions and offset by proceeds of Ps.119.0 million from the sale of Argentine Central Bank debt instruments (Nobac and Lebac) and other securities, (ii) Ps.385.4 million of organization and development expenses, and (iii) Ps.118.4 million due to the increase of net other assets and liabilities. In fiscal year 2010, net cash provided by operating activities amounted to Ps.2,762.9 million. This increase was mainly attributable to the decrease in government and private securities of Ps.2,911.0 related to sales and the collection of amortization and interest on Boden 2012 Bonds for Ps.1,808.6 million, Ps.487.2 million of sales of Discount Bonds, Ps.363.6 million due to the decrease of Argentine Central Bank debt instruments (Nobac and Lebac), Ps.80.7 million of sales of Bonar 2015 Bonds, and a Ps.170.9 million decrease corresponding to other securities. The increase in deposits of Ps.4,181.0 million, corresponding to: (a) an increase of Ps.3,326.9 million in demand deposits and (b) an increase of Ps.854.1 million in time deposits, was offset by the increase of Ps.4,453.4 million in loans mainly attributable to our private-sector loan portfolio origination.

Cash equal to Ps.133.7 million was applied to bank premises and equipment and miscellaneous assets and Ps.347.2 million attributable to investments in other companies mainly related to the acquisition of CFA.

Banco Galicias Liquidity Management Banco Galicia Consolidated Liquidity Gaps Liquidity risk is the risk that liquid assets are not available for Banco Galicia to meet financial commitments at contractual maturity, take advantage of potential investment opportunities and meet demand for credit. To monitor and control liquidity risk, Banco Galicia monitors and systematically calculates the gaps between financial assets and liabilities maturing within set time intervals based on contractual remaining maturity, on a consolidated basis with the Regional Credit Card Companies and CFA. All of the deposits in current accounts and other demand deposits and deposits in savings accounts are included in the first time interval. These figures are used to simulate different liquidity crisis scenarios based on assumptions stemming from historical experience. As of December 31, 2011, the consolidated gaps between maturities of Banco Galicias financial assets and liabilities based on contractual remaining maturity were as follows As of December 31, 2011 (1) Less thanone Year 1 5 Years 5 10 Years Over 10 Years Total (in millions of Pesos, except ratios) Assets Cash and Due from Banks 2,475.3    2,475.3 Argentine Central Bank  Escrow Accounts 4,381.8    4,381.8 Overnight Placements 66.0    66.0 Loans  Public Sector 314.9    314.9 Loans  Private Sector 25,488.1 4,424.5 178.6 10.7 30,101.9 Government Securities 3,294.9 778.1   4,073.0 Notes and Corporate Securities 74.6 34.3 28.3  137.2 Financial Trusts 483.2 558.4 147.1  1,188.7 Special Fund Former Almafuerte Bank  168.0   168.0 Other Financing 132.2    132.2 Receivables from Financial Leases 229.5 376.7 39.4 1.4 647.0 Other 1,504.8    1,504.8 Total Assets 38,445.3 6,340.0 393.4 12.1 45,190.8 Liabilities Savings Accounts 7,800.1    7,800.1 Demand Deposits 7,732.9    7,732.9 Time Deposits 14,367.5 18.3   14,385.8 Notes 535.2 1,838.0 1,565.9  3,939.1 International Banks and Credit Agencies 1,248.1 221.7   1,469.8 Domestic Banks 645.9 198.0 4.8 0.1 848.8 Other Liabilities (1) 6,052.3    6,052.3 Total Liabilities 38,382.0 2,276.0 1,570.7 0.1 42,228.8 Asset / Liability Gap 63.3 4,064.0 (1,177.3 ) 12.0 2,962.0 Cumulative Gap 63.3 4,127.3 2,950.0 2,962.0 2,962.0 Ratio of Cumulative Gap to Cumulative Liabilities 0.2 % 10.2 % 7.0 % 7.0 % Ratio of Cumulative Gap to Total Liabilities 0.2 % 9.8 % 7.0 % 7.0 % Principal plus CER adjustment. Does not include interest. (1) Includes, mainly, debt with retailers due to credit card operations, liabilities in connection with repurchase transactions, debt with domestic credit agencies and collections for third parties. The Less than One Year bucket also includes Ps.7.1 million corresponding to Banco Galicias foreign debt not tendered by its holders in the exchange offered to restructure such foreign debt, which was completed in May 2004. The table above is prepared taking into account contractual maturity. Therefore, all financial assets and liabilities with no maturity date are included in the Less than One Year category. -139- Table of Contents Banco Galicia must comply with a maximum limit set by its board of directors for liquidity mismatches. This limit has been established at -25% (minus 25%) for the ratio of cumulative gap to total liabilities within the first year. As shown in the table above, Banco Galicia complies with the established policy, since such gap was 0.2% as of December 31, 2011. Banco Galicia (Unconsolidated) Liquidity Management The following is a discussion of Banco Galicias liquidity management, excluding the consolidated companies. Banco Galicias policy is to maintain a level of liquid assets that allows it to meet financial commitments at contractual maturity, take advantage of potential investment opportunities, and meet customers credit demand. To set the appropriate level, forecasts are made based on historical experience and on an analysis of possible scenarios. This enables management to project funding needs and alternative funding sources, as well as excess liquidity and placement strategies for such funds. As of December 31, 2011, Banco Galicias unconsolidated liquidity structure was as follows: As of December 31, 2011 (in millions of Pesos) Legal Requirement Ps.6,303.3 Management Liquidity 4,671.4 Total Liquidity (1) Ps.10,974.7 (1) Excludes cash and due from banks of consolidated companies. The legal liquidity requirements in the table above correspond to the Minimum Cash Requirements for Peso- and Dollar-denominated liabilities determined by Argentine Central Bank regulations. For more information on the Argentine Central Bank regulations regarding reserve requirements for liquidity purposes, see Item 4. Information on the Company-Argentine Banking Regulation-Legal Reserve Requirements for Liquidity Purposes. The assets included in this calculation are technical cash, which consists of bills and coins, the balances of Peso- and Dollar-denominated deposit accounts at the Argentine Central Bank and escrow accounts held at the Argentine Central Bank in favor of clearing houses. Management liquidity consists of the following items: (i) 100% of the balance of overnight placements in banks abroad, (ii) the net amount of the margin requirement for short-term loans (call loans) to highly-rated companies, (iii) 90% of the Lebac balance, (iv) 100% of the market value of available government securities, due to the potential liquidity that might be obtained through sales or repurchase transactions, (v) net short-term interbank loans (call loans), and (vi) 100% of the balance at the Argentine Central Bank, including escrow accounts in favor of clearing houses, in excess of the amounts necessary to cover the Minimum Cash Requirements. Capital Our capital management policy is designed to ensure prudent levels of capital. The following table analyzes our capital resources as of the dates indicated. As of December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions of Pesos, except ratios, multiples and percentages) Shareholders Equity Ps.3,551.6 Ps.2,469.5 Ps.2,052.5 Shareholders Equity as a Percentage of Total Assets 6.94 % 6.92 % 7.44 % Total Liabilities as a Multiple of Total Shareholders Equity 13.41 x 13.46 x 12.45 x Tangible Shareholders Equity (1) as a Percentage of Total Assets 5.53 % 5.64 % 5.36 % (1) Tangible shareholders equity represents shareholders equity minus intangible assets. -140- Table of Contents For information on our capital adequacy and that of our operating subsidiaries, see Item 4. Information on the Company-Selected Statistical Information-Regulatory Capital.

Pursuant to Argentine law and to the provisions of Banco Galicias bylaws, Banco Galicias syndics and alternate syndics are responsible of ensuring that all of Banco Galicias actions are in accordance with applicable Argentine law. Syndics and alternate syndics do not participate in business management and cannot have managerial functions of any type. Syndics are responsible for, among other things, the preparation of a report to the shareholders analyzing Banco Galicias financial statements for each year and the recommendation to the shareholders as to whether to approve such financial statements. Syndics and alternate syndics are elected at the ordinary shareholders meeting for a one-year term and they can be re-elected. Alternate syndics act in the temporary or permanent absence of a syndic. The table below shows the composition of Banco Galicias Supervisory Committee as they were re-elected by the annual shareholders meeting held on April 19, 2012.

He obtained a degree in national public accounting at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. He was elected as an alternate syndic on April 19, 2012. Compensation of Banco Galicias Directors and Officers Banco Galicias board of directors establishes the policy for compensation of Banco Galicias personnel. Banco Galicias managers receive a fixed compensation and they may receive a variable compensation, based on their performance. Five directors and an alternate director are employees of Banco Galicia and, therefore, receive a fixed compensation and may also receive a variable compensation based on their performance, provided that these additional payments do not exceed the standard levels of similar entities in the Argentine financial market, a provision that is applicable to managers as well. The compensation regime includes the possibility of acquiring a retirement insurance policy. Banco Galicia does not maintain stock-option plans or pension plans or any other retirement plans for the benefit of its directors and managers. Banco Galicia does not have a policy establishing any termination benefits for its directors. For fiscal year 2011, Banco Galicias ordinary shareholdersmeeting held on April 19, 2012, approved compensation for the independent directors in the total amount of Ps.0.77 million. Annually, provisions are established to cover the variable compensation of Banco Galicias board of directors and employees for the fiscal year. During the first quarter of each year, Banco Galicias board of directors analyzes the possibility of paying employees a variable compensation for the previous fiscal year ended based on the compensation for similar jobs in the labor market in recognition of the performance and professional development of the respective beneficiaries during the fiscal year. -153- Table of Contents Employees The following table shows the composition of our staff: As of December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Grupo Financiero Galicia S.A. 13 13 10 Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires S.A. 5,525 5,185 5,028 Branches 2,756 2,685 2,636 Head Office 2,769 2,500 2,392 Galicia Uruguay 5 7 8 Regional Credit-Card Companies 5,507 4,699 3,936 CFA 1,118 1,160  Sudamericana Consolidated 162 126 116 Other Subsidiaries 46 48 44 Total 12,376 11,238 9.142 Within the current legal framework, membership in an employee union is voluntary and there is only one union of bank employees with national representation. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 16% of Banco Galicias employees were affiliated with the national bank employee union. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 96.5% of the Regional Credit Card Companies work force was party to the merchant unions Collective Bargaining Agreement No. 130/75 applicable to trade employees, 2.6% of which were members of a labor union and 0.03% of which were labor union representatives. As of December 31, 2011, CFAs employees were not affiliated to any union. During the first four months of 2011, 2010 and 2009, the bank employee union and the national commerce employee union renegotiated their respective collective labor agreements in order to establish new minimum wages. As a result, between March and April of each year, salary increases were granted. Banco Galicia has not experienced a strike by its employees since 1973 and the Regional Credit Card Companies and CFA have never experienced any strike event. We believe that our relationship with our employees has developed within normal and satisfactory parameters. We have a human resources policy that aims at providing our employees possibilities for growth and personal and socio-economic achievement. We will continue our current policy of monitoring both wage levels and labor conditions in the financial industry in order to be competitive. Our employees receive fixed compensation and may receive variable compensation according to their level of achievement. We do not maintain any profit-sharing programs for our employees. The Fundación Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires (the Fundación) is an Argentine non-profit organization that provides various services to Banco Galicia employees. The various activities of the Fundación include, among others, purchasing school materials for the children of Banco Galicias employees and making donations to hospitals and other charitable causes, including cultural events. The Fundación is managed by a Council, certain members and alternate members of which are members of our Board of Directors and supervisory committee. Members and alternate members of the Council do not receive remuneration for their services as trustees. Nasdaq Corporate Governance Standards Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5615(a) (3), a foreign private issuer may follow home country corporate governance practices in lieu of the requirements of the Rule 5600 Series, provided that the foreign private issuer complies with certain sections of the Rule 5000 Series, discloses each requirement that it does not follow and describes the home relevant country practice followed in lieu of such requirement. The requirements of the Rule 5000 Series and the Argentine corporate governance practice that we follow in lieu thereof are described below: -154- Table of Contents (i) Rule 5250 (d)Distribution of Annual and Interim Reports. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5250 (d), we follow Argentine law, which requires that companies make public a Spanish language annual report, including annual audited consolidated financial statements, by filing such annual report with the CNV and the BASE, within 70 calendar days of the end of the companys fiscal year. Interim reports must be filed with the CNV and the BASE within 42 calendar days of the end of each fiscal quarter. The BASE publishes the annual reports and interim reports in the BASE bulletin and makes the bulletin available for inspection at its offices. In addition, our shareholders can receive copies of our annual reports and any interim reports upon such shareholders request. English language translations of our annual reports and interim reports are furnished to the SEC. We also post the English language translation of our annual reports and quarterly press releases on our website. Furthermore, under the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated as of June 22, 2000, among us, The Bank of New York, as depositary, and owners of ADSs issued thereunder, we are required to furnish The Bank of New York with, among other things, English language translations of our annual reports and each of our quarterly press releases. Annual reports and quarterly press releases are available for inspection by ADRs holders at the offices of The Bank of New York located at, 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York. Finally, Argentine law requires that 20 calendar days before the date of a shareholders meeting, the board of directors must provide to the shareholders, at the companys executive office or through electronic means, all information relevant to the shareholders meeting, including copies of any documents to be considered by the shareholders (which includes the annual report), as well as proposals of the companys board of directors. (ii) Rule 5605 (b) (1)  Majority of Independent Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (b) (1), we follow Argentine law, which does not require that a majority of the board of directors be comprised of independent directors. Argentine law instead requires that public companies in Argentina such as us must have a sufficient number of independent directors to be able to form an audit committee of at least three members, the majority of which must be independent pursuant to the criteria established by the CNV. In addition, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 5615 (c) (1), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 5615 (c) (2). (iii) Rule 5605 (b) (2)  Executive Sessions of Independent Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (b) (2), we follow Argentine law which does not require independent directors to hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only such independent directors are present (i.e., executive sessions). Our Board of Directors as a whole is responsible for monitoring our affairs. In addition, under Argentine law, the board of directors may approve the delegation of specific responsibilities to designated directors or non-director managers of the company. Also, it is mandatory for public companies to form a supervisory committee (composed of syndics), which is responsible for monitoring the legality of the companys actions under Argentine law and the conformity thereof with its by-laws. (iv) Rule 5605 (d)  Compensation of Officers. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (d), we follow Argentine law, which does not require companies to form a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. It also is not required in Argentine law that the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers be determined by either a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. Under Argentine law, the board of directors is the corporate body responsible for determining the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers, so long as they are not directors. In addition, under Argentine law, the audit committee shall give its opinion about the reasonableness of managements proposals on fees and option plans for directors or managers of the company. Finally, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 5615 (c) (1), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 5615 (c) (2). (v) Rule 5605 (e) (1)  Nomination of Directors. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (e) (1), we follow Argentine law which requires that directors be nominated directly by the shareholders at the shareholders meeting and that they be selected and recommended by the shareholders themselves. Under Argentine law, it is the responsibility of the ordinary shareholders meeting to appoint and remove directors and to set their compensation. In addition, because we are a controlled company as defined in Rule 5615 (c) (1), we are relying on the exemption provided thereby for purposes of complying with Rule 5615 (c) (2). (vi) Rule 5605 (c) (1)  Audit Committee Charter. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5605 (c) (1), we follow Argentine law, which requires that audit committees have a charter but does not require that companies certify as to the adoption of the charter nor does it require an annual review and assessment thereof. Argentine law instead requires that companies prepare a proposed plan or course of action with respect to those matters, which are the responsibility of the companys audit committee. Such plan or course of action could, at the discretion of our audit committee, include a review and assessment of the audit committee charter. -155- Table of Contents (vii) Rule 5605 (c) (2)  Audit Committee Composition. Argentine law does not require, and it is equally not customary business practice in Argentina, that companies have an audit committee comprised solely of independent directors. Argentine law instead requires that companies establish an audit committee with at least three members comprised of a majority of independent directors as defined by Argentine law. Nonetheless, although not required by Argentine law, until April 19, 2012, we had an Audit Committee entirely comprised of three independent directors, pursuant to the definition of independence in Rule 10 A-3 (b) (1), one of which the Board of Directors determined to be a financial expert. Currently, our Audit Committee is comprised of three Directors; two of which meet such independent requirements. In addition, we have a supervisory committee (comisión fiscalizadora) composed of three syndics, which are in charge of monitoring the legality, under Argentine law, of the actions of our Board of Directors and the conformity of such actions with our by-laws. (viii) Rule 5620 (c)  Quorum. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5620 (c), we follow Argentine law and our bylaws, which distinguish between ordinary meetings and extraordinary meetings and require, in connection with ordinary meetings, that a quorum consist of a majority of stock entitled to vote. If no quorum is present at the first meeting, a second meeting may be called at which the shareholders present, whatever their number, constitute a quorum and resolutions may be adopted by an absolute majority of the votes present. Argentine law and our bylaws require, in connection with extraordinary meetings, that a quorum consist of 60% of the stock entitled to vote. However, if such quorum is not present at the first meeting, our bylaws provide that a second meeting may be called which may be held with the number of shareholders present. In both ordinary and extraordinary meetings, decisions are adopted by an absolute majority of votes present at the meeting, except for certain fundamental matters (such as mergers and spin-offs (when we are not the surviving entity and the surviving entity is not listed on any stock exchange), anticipated liquidation, a change in our domicile to outside of Argentina, total or partial recapitalization of our statutory capital following a loss, any transformation in our corporate legal form or a substantial change in our corporate purpose) which require an approval by vote of the majority of all the stock entitled to vote (all stock being entitled to only one vote). (ix) Rule 5620 (b)  Solicitation of Proxies. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5620 (b), we follow Argentine law which requires that notices of shareholders meetings be published, for five consecutive days, in the Official Gazette and in a widely circulated newspaper in Argentina no earlier than 45 calendar days prior to the meeting and at least 20 calendar days prior to such meeting. In order to attend a meeting and be listed on the meeting registry, shareholders are required to submit evidence of their book-entry share account held at Caja de Valores S.A. (Caja de Valores) up to three business days prior to the scheduled meeting date. If entitled to attend the meeting, a shareholder may be represented by proxy (properly executed and delivered with a certified signature) granted to any other person, with the exception of a director, syndic, member of the surveillance committee (consejo de vigilancia), manager or employee of the issuer, which are prohibited by Argentine law from acting as proxies. In addition, our ADRs holders receive, prior to the shareholders meeting, a notice listing the matters on the agenda, a copy of the annual report and a voting card. (x) Rule 5630 (a)  Conflicts of Interest. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 5630 (a), we follow Argentine law which requires that related party transactions be approved by the audit committee when the transaction exceeds one percent (1%) of the corporations net worth, measured pursuant to the last audited balance sheet, so long as the relevant transaction exceeds the equivalent of three hundred thousand Argentine Pesos (Ps.300,000). Directors can contract with the corporation only on terms consistent with prevailing market terms. If the contract is not in accordance with prevailing market terms, such transaction must be pre-approved by the board of directors (excluding the interested director). In addition, under Argentine law, a shareholder is required to abstain from voting on a business transaction in which its interests may be in conflict with the interests of the company. In the event such shareholder votes on such business transaction and such business transaction would not have been approved without such shareholders vote, such shareholder may be liable to the company for damages and the resolution may be declared void. -156- Table of Contents Other than as noted above, we are in full compliance with all other applicable Nasdaq corporate governance standards.

Members of the Escasany family have been on the board of directors of Banco Galicia since 1923. The Ayerza and Braun families have been represented on Banco Galicias board of directors since 1943 and 1947, respectively. Currently, there is one member of these families on Banco Galicias board of directors and five members of these families on our Board of Directors. In addition, there is one alternate director on our Board of Directors that is member of the controlling families. On September 13, 1999, the controlling shareholders of Banco Galicia formed EBA Holding S.A., an Argentine corporation, which is 100% owned by our controlling shareholders. EBA Holding holds 100% of our class A shares. Currently, EBA Holding only has class A shares outstanding. EBA Holdings bylaws provide for certain restrictions on the sale or transfer of its class A shares. While the class A shares of EBA Holding may be transferred to any other class A shareholder of EBA Holding, any transfer of such class A shares to third parties would automatically result in the conversion of the sold shares into class B shares of EBA Holding having one vote per share. In addition, EBA Holdings bylaws contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions and tag-along rights. A public shareholder of Banco Galicia, who indirectly owns approximately 4.5% of the outstanding capital stock of Banco Galicia, has granted a right of first refusal for the purchase of all or part of its shares to certain of our controlling shareholders in the event such public shareholder decides to sell all or part of its Banco Galicia shares.
