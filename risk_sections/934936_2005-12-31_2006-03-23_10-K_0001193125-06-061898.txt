Item 1A. Risk Factors This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our business, operating results, financial performance, and share price may be materially adversely affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to the following risk factors, any one of which could cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results or from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us in this annual report on Form 10-K or in other reports, press releases or other statements issued from time to time. Additional factors that may cause such a difference are set forth elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. We have incurred substantial operating losses since we started doing business and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in the future, which may negatively impact our ability to run our business. We have incurred net losses since 2000, including net losses of $8.9 million in 2005, and $5.7 million in 2004 and $8.7 million in 2003. We have accumulated net losses of approximately $36.3 million from our inception through December 31, 2005, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in the future. We plan to continue the costly process of simultaneously conducting clinical trials and preclinical research for multiple product candidates. Our product development program may not lead to commercial products, either 12 Table of Contents because our product candidates fail to be effective, are not attractive to the market, or because we lack the necessary financial or other resources or relationships to pursue our programs through commercialization. Our net losses are likely to increase significantly as we continue preclinical research and clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals, develop our product candidates, and develop the infrastructure to support commercialization of our potential products. We have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities to investors and may not be able to generate positive cash flow in the future. We expect that we will need to seek additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or other sources of financing during 2006. If we are unable to obtain necessary additional financing, our ability to run our business will be adversely affected and we may be required to reduce the scope of our research and business activity or cease our operations. We do not have sufficient cash to fund the development of our drug delivery operations. If we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future, we will be required to reduce the scope of our business or cease our operations. With the $14.1 million in net proceeds we raised in our private placement of common stock completed in February 2005, we believe that our cash on hand, including our cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our drug delivery business at planned levels through early 2007. We will need to raise additional capital to fund operations, conduct clinical trials, continue research and development projects, and commercialize our product candidates. The timing and amount of our need for additional financing will depend on a number of factors, including:  the structure and timing of collaborations with strategic partners and licensees;  our timetable and costs for the development of marketing operations and other activities related to the commercialization of our product candidates;  the progress of our research and development programs and expansion of such programs;  the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments; and,  the prosecution, defense and enforcement of potential patent claims and other intellectual property rights. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders may result which could decrease the market price of our common stock due to the sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the perception of possible sales, could also impair our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, the terms of any equity financing may adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through strategic alliance, and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us, which could substantially reduce the value of our business. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing, we would be unable to meet our obligations and we would be required to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our business operations, including the pursuit of licensing, strategic alliances and development of drug delivery programs. If our clinical trials are not successful or take longer to complete than we expect, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our products. In order to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of potential products utilizing our CDT platform, we or our collaborators will be required to complete clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy, or in certain cases, the bioequivalence, of the products. However, we or our collaborators may not 13 Table of Contents be able to commence or complete these clinical trials in any specified time period, or at all, either because the appropriate regulatory agency objects or for other reasons, including:  unexpected delays in the initiation of clinical sites;  slower than projected enrollment of eligible patients;  competition with other ongoing clinical trials for clinical investigators or eligible patients;  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians;  limits on manufacturing capacity; and,  the failure of our products to meet required standards. We also rely on academic institutions and clinical research organizations to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates. We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted the monitoring and supervision on our own. Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated scheduled or consistent with a clinical trial protocol. Even if we complete a clinical trial of one of our potential products, the clinical trial may not indicate that our product is safe or effective to the extent required by the FDA or other regulatory agency to approve the product. If clinical trials do not show any potential product to be safe or efficacious, or if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our products in development beyond those that we currently contemplate, we may be delayed in obtaining, or may not obtain, marketing approval for our products. Our product development costs may also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals, which could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and would impair our ability to commercialize our products. We may not obtain regulatory approval for our products, which would materially impair our ability to generate revenue. Each OTC or pharmaceutical product developed by us will require a separate costly and time consuming regulatory approval before we or our collaborators can manufacture and sell it in the United States or internationally. The regulatory process to obtain market approval for a new drug takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. We have had only limited experience in preparing applications and do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approvals. As a result, we believe we will rely primarily on third party contractors to obtain regulatory approval, which means we will have less control over the timing and other aspects of the regulatory process than if we had our own expertise in this area. Third parties may not perform their responsibilities on our anticipated schedule or consistent with our priorities. We may encounter delays or rejections during any stage of the regulatory approval process based upon the failure of clinical data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure of the product to meet the FDAs requirements for safety, efficacy, quality, and/or bioequivalence; and, those requirements may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy or the adoption of new regulations. After submission of a marketing application, in the form of an NDA or ANDA, the FDA may deny the application, may require additional testing or data, and/or may require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. In addition, the terms of approval of any marketing application, including the labeling content, may be more restrictive than we desire and could affect the marketability of products incorporating our controlled release technology. Certain products incorporating our technology will require the filing of an NDA. A full NDA must include complete reports of preclinical, clinical, and other studies to prove adequately that the product is safe and effective, which involves among other things, full clinical testing, and as a result requires the expenditure of 14 Table of Contents substantial resources. In certain cases involving controlled release versions of FDA-approved immediate release products, we may be able to rely on existing publicly available safety and efficacy data to support an NDA for controlled release products under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA when such data exists for an approved immediate release or controlled release version of the same active chemical ingredient. We can provide no assurance, however, that the FDA will accept a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, or that we will be able to obtain publicly available data that is useful. The Section 505(b)(2) NDA process is a highly uncertain avenue to approval because the FDAs policies on Section 505(b)(2) have not yet been fully developed. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve an application submitted under Section 505(b)(2) in a timely manner or at all. Our inability to rely on the 505(b)(2) process would increase the cost and extend the time frame for FDA approvals. We face intense competition in the drug delivery business, and our failure to compete effectively would decrease our ability to generate meaningful revenues from our products. The drug delivery business is highly competitive and is affected by new technologies, governmental regulations, health care legislation, availability of financing, litigation and other factors. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, research and development, marketing and other resources than we do. We are subject to competition from numerous other entities that currently operate or intend to operate in the industry. These include companies that are engaged in the development of controlled-release drug delivery technologies and products as well as other manufacturers that may decide to undertake in-house development of these products. Some of our direct competitors in the drug delivery industry include Alza Corporation, Biovail, Inc., Penwest, Skyepharma PLC, Elan, Flamel, Impax Laboratories, Inc., Labopharm, and KV Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Many of our competitors have more extensive experience than we have in conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Many competitors also have competing products that have already received regulatory approval or are in late-stage development, and may have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective, safer or more affordable products, or obtain more effective patent protection, than we are able to develop, commercialize or obtain. As a result, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we do, which would adversely affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our products will achieve market acceptance, and our ability to generate meaningful revenues from our products. If we fail to comply with extensive government regulations covering the manufacture, distribution and labeling of our products, we may have to withdraw our products from the market, close our facilities or cease our operations. Our products, potential products, and manufacturing and research activities are subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the United States (including the Drug Enforcement Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Environmental Protection Agency) and in other countries. For example, our activities, including preclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing, distribution, and labeling are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable authorities outside the United States. Also, our statements and our customers statements regarding dietary supplement products are subject to regulation by the FTC. The FTC enforces laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices, including false or misleading advertising. In recent years, the FTC has brought a number of actions challenging claims by nutraceutical companies. Each OTC or pharmaceutical product developed by us will require a separate costly and time consuming regulatory approval before we or our collaborators can manufacture and sell it in the United States or internationally. Even if regulatory approval is received, there may be limits imposed by regulators on a products 15 Table of Contents use or it may face subsequent regulatory difficulties. Approved products are subject to continuous review and the facilities that manufacture them are subject to periodic inspections. Furthermore, regulatory agencies may require additional and expensive post-approval studies. If previously unknown problems with a product candidate surface or the manufacturing or laboratory facility is deemed non-compliant with applicable regulatory requirements, an agency may impose restrictions on that product or on us, including requiring us to withdraw the product from the market, close the facility, and/or pay substantial fines. We also may incur significant costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations. We are subject to federal, state, local and other laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of materials and certain waste products. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for any damages that result and these damages could exceed our resources. If we cannot establish collaborative arrangements with leading individuals, companies and research institutions, we may have to discontinue the development and commercialization of our products. We have limited experience in conducting full scale clinical trials, preparing and submitting regulatory applications or manufacturing and selling pharmaceutical products. In addition, we do not have sufficient resources to fund the development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our products. We expect to seek collaborative arrangements and alliances with corporate and academic partners, licensors and licensees to assist with funding research and development, to conduct clinical testing, and to provide manufacturing, marketing, and commercialization of our product candidates. We may rely on collaborative arrangements to obtain the regulatory approvals for our products. For our collaboration efforts to be successful, we must identify partners whose competencies complement ours. We must also enter into collaboration agreements with them on terms that are favorable to us and integrate and coordinate their resources and capabilities with our own. We may be unsuccessful in entering into collaboration agreements with acceptable partners or negotiating favorable terms in these agreements. Factors that may affect the success of our collaborations include the following:  our collaborators may have insufficient economic motivation to continue their funding, research, development, and commercialization activities;  our collaborators may discontinue funding any particular program, which could delay or halt the development or commercialization of any product candidates arising out of the program;  our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies or products, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors;  our collaborators may lack sufficient financial, technical or other capabilities to develop these product candidates;  we may underestimate the length of time that it takes for our collaborators to achieve various clinical development and regulatory approval milestones; and,  our collaborators may be unable to successfully address any regulatory or technical challenges they may encounter. If we cannot establish collaborative relationships, we will be required to find alternative sources of funding and to develop our own capabilities to manufacture, market, and sell our products. If we were not successful in finding funding and developing these capabilities, we would have to terminate the development and commercialization of our products. 16 Table of Contents We have no manufacturing capabilities and will be dependent on third party manufacturers. We do not have commercial scale facilities to manufacture any products we may develop in accordance with requirements prescribed by the FDA. Consequently, we have to rely on third party manufacturers of the products we are evaluating in clinical trials. There can be no assurance that any third parties upon which we rely for our products in clinical development will perform. If there are any failures by these third parties, they may delay development of or the submission of products for regulatory approval, impair our collaborators ability to commercialize products as planned and deliver products on a timely basis, require us or our collaborators to cease distribution or recall some or all batches of our products or otherwise impair our competitive position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property, our business, financial condition and ability to compete would suffer. We principally rely on patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We own or have exclusive rights to several U.S. patents and patent applications and we expect to apply for additional U.S. and foreign patents in the future. The patent positions of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and bio-pharmaceutical firms, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal issues are largely unresolved. The coverage claimed in our patent applications can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and the claims allowed on any patents or trademarks we hold may not be broad enough to protect our technology. In addition, our patents or trademarks may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or the patents of others may impede our collaborators ability to commercialize the technology covered by our owned or licensed patents. Moreover, any current or future issued or licensed patents, or trademarks, or existing or future trade secrets or know-how, may not afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technologies or processes, and the possibility exists that certain of our already issued patents or trademarks may infringe upon third party patents or trademarks or be designed around by others. In addition, there is a risk that others may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as, or substantially equivalent or superior to ours, or become available in the market at a lower price. There is a risk that we have infringed or in the future will infringe patents or trademarks owned by others, that we will need to acquire licenses under patents or trademarks belonging to others for technology potentially useful or necessary to us, and that licenses will not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. We cannot assure you that:  our patents or any future patents will prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents;  any of our future processes or products will be patentable;  any pending or additional patents will be issued in any or all appropriate jurisdictions;  our processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties; or,  we will have the resources to defend against charges of patent infringement by third parties or to protect our own patent rights against infringement by third parties. We may have to litigate to enforce our patents or trademarks or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights. Litigation could be very costly and divert managements attention. An adverse outcome in any litigation could adversely affect our financial results and stock price. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which we seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators. There is a risk that these agreements may be breached, and that the remedies available to us may not be adequate. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known to or be independently discovered by others. 17 Table of Contents Significant expenses in applying for patent protection and prosecuting our patent applications will increase our need for capital and could harm our business and financial condition. We intend to continue our substantial efforts in applying for patent protection and prosecuting pending and future patent applications both in the United States and internationally. These efforts have historically required the expenditure of considerable time and money, and we expect that they will continue to require significant expenditures. If future changes in United States or foreign patent laws complicate or hinder our efforts to obtain patent protection, the costs associated with patent prosecution may increase significantly. If we fail to attract and retain key executive and technical personnel we could experience a negative impact on our ability to develop and commercialize our products and our business will suffer. The success of our operations will depend to a great extent on the collective experience, abilities and continued service of relatively few individuals. We are dependent upon the continued availability of the services of our employees, many of whom are individually key to our future success. For example, if we lose the services of our President and CEO, Daniel O. Wilds, or our Vice President and Chief Technical Officer, Stephen J. Turner, we could experience a negative impact on our ability to develop and commercialize our CDT technology, our financial results and our stock price. We also rely on members of our scientific staff for product research and development. The loss of the services of key members of this staff could substantially impair our ongoing research and development and our ability to obtain additional financing. In addition, we are dependent upon the continued availability of Dr. Reza Fassihi, a member of our board of directors with whom we have a consulting agreement. The agreement expires December 31, 2006, but may be terminated by either party on 30- days notice. If our relationship with Dr. Fassihi is terminated, we could experience a negative impact on our ability to develop and commercialize our CDT technology. Our success also significantly depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We face intense competition for personnel in the drug delivery industry. To compete for personnel, we may need to pay higher salaries and provide other incentives than those paid and provided by more established entities. Our limited financial resources may hinder our ability to provide such salaries and incentives. Our personnel may voluntarily terminate their relationship with us at any time, and the process of locating additional personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy could be lengthy, costly, and disruptive. If we lose the services of key personnel, or fail to replace the services of key personnel who depart, we could experience a severe negative impact on our financial results and stock price. Future laws or regulations may hinder or prohibit the production or sale of our products. We may be subject to additional laws or regulations in the future, such as those administered by the FDA or other federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities. Laws or regulations that we consider favorable, such as the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, DSHEA, may be repealed. Current laws or regulations may be interpreted more stringently. We are unable to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations or interpretations, nor can we predict what effect they may have on our business. Possible effects or requirements could include the following:  The reformulation of certain products to meet new standards;  The recall or discontinuance of certain products unable to be reformulated;  Imposition of additional record keeping requirements;  Expanded documentation of the properties of certain products; or,  Expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. Any such requirement could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 18 Table of Contents If we fail to adequately manage the size of our business, it could have a severe negative impact on our financial results or stock price. Our management believes that, to be successful, we must appropriately manage the size of our business. We have added numerous personnel and have added several new research and development projects. We anticipate that we will experience additional growth in connection with the development, manufacture, and commercialization of our products. If we experience rapid growth of our operations, we will be required to implement operational, financial and information procedures and controls that are efficient and appropriate for the size and scope of our operations. The management skills and systems currently in place may not be adequate and we may not be able to manage any significant growth effectively. Our failure to effectively manage our existing operations or our growth could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance or stock price. A significant number of shares of our common stock are or will be eligible for sale in the open market, which could drive down the market price for our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise capital. As of March 1, 2006, 35,216,506 shares of our common stock were outstanding, and there were 5,629,792 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of outstanding options and warrants. Sales of a large number of shares could materially decrease the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Our stockholders may experience substantial dilution if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities. We will need to seek additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or other sources of financing. The issuance of a large number of additional shares of our common stock upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding options or warrants or in an equity financing transaction could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock due to the sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. The risk of dilution and the resulting downward pressure on our stock price could also encourage investors to engage in short sales of our common stock. By increasing the number of shares offered for sale, material amounts of short selling could further contribute to progressive price declines in our common stock. Certain provisions in our charter documents and otherwise may discourage third parties from attempting to acquire control of our company, which may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Our board of directors has the authority, without obtaining stockholder approval, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also provide for a classified board and special advance notice provisions for proposed business at annual meetings. In addition, Delaware and Washington law contain certain provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a hostile takeover of our company. Further, we have a stockholder rights plan that is designed to cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire our company without approval of our board of directors, and thereby make a hostile takeover attempt prohibitively expensive for a potential acquiror. These provisions, among others, may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of our company, even if stockholders may consider such a change in control to be in their best interests, which may cause the price of our common stock to suffer.
