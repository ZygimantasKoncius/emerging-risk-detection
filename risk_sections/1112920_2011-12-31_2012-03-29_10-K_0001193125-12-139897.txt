Item 1A. Risk Factors We have described below risks that we are aware of that could have a material adverse effect on your stock ownership and our business. 23 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Operations We may not achieve the expected market traction and financial results from our recent solution additions, such as Mail Express, our cloud-based Managed Information Xchange and Hosted Enhanced File Transfer Server solutions, and TappIn, or from future solutions such as appShield. Much of our revenue growth in recent years is attributable to sales of Enhanced File Transfer Server Enterprise software (and from maintenance and support contracts associated with Enhanced File Transfer Server Enterprise) and from delivery of our professional services. While Enhanced File Transfer Server revenues continue to grow, this solution has numerous competitors and new license sales have slowed in recent years. Similarly, we have grown our professional services capabilities, and associated revenues years in recent years. However, the cost of revenues from professional services are significantly higher than for software license sales and a significant part of our services revenue is associated with a single contract (McLane Advanced Technologies), supporting a single U.S. Army customer. For these reasons, we believe improving, and possibly even sustaining, our financial results is dependent on achieving additional market traction with our recent and potential future solution additions. We have announced several new solutions since the beginning of 2010, including our Managed Information Exchange and Hosted Enhanced File Transfer Server cloud-based solutions, the appShield consumer security solution, and a new version of Mail Express. Most recently, in December 2011, we announced the acquisition of TappIn, Inc. Through introduction of these solutions, we have entered the cloud services and secure content mobility markets and, with the new releases of Mail Express, extended our capabilities in the MFT market. In addition, we plan to enter the antivirus segment of the endpoint security market with appShield. We believe the cloud services, secure content mobility, and endpoint security markets potentially provide significant upside to our historical MFT business results. However, entering and gaining traction in such markets will require that we market, sell, and support these solutions effectively. Each of these success factors has inherent risks due to, for example, our limited corporate expertise in the adjacent markets and the possibility that the specific buyers of solutions in these adjacent markets may be different from the buyers with whom we interact throughout our traditional MFT sales cycle. In addition, entering, obtaining traction, and sustaining growth in these markets requires investments in engineering, marketing, sales, customer support, and internal business systems. Because our experience suggests that it takes several quarters, or even longer, to obtain market traction with a new solution and to identify the trends necessary to develop projections of future business performance, it is difficult to determine when, or if, these prior, ongoing, and future solution investments will be offset by increased sales and revenue. Therefore, inability to gain additional sales traction with recent and new solutions in markets like cloud services, secure content mobility, and endpoint security may adversely impact our financial results in the future. Our recent acquisition of TappIn, Inc. and possible future acquisitions give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results. The TappIn acquisition, and acquisitions generally, involve a number of risks and challenges, including:  Complexity, time, and costs associated with integration of the acquired business operations, workforce, products, and technologies into our existing business, sales force, employee base, product lines, marketing and technology. The possibility exists that the integration ultimately may not be successful;  Diversion of management time and attention from our existing business and other business opportunities throughout the integration;  Potential loss or termination of employees, including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees; 24 Table of Contents  Assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business, including any future litigation related to alleged liabilities of the acquired business;  The incurrence of additional acquisition-related debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements;  Potential dilution of earnings per share;  Increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and  Potentially substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses, write-off of in-process research and development, impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense. If the integration of TappIn is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of the acquisition or undergo other adverse effects. To integrate acquired businesses, including TappIn, we must determine and leverage the actual market synergies, sustain and even extend the business performance of the acquired entity, implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. We also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests. Through the TappIn acquisition, we have entered a new adjacent market in which we have limited experience. Secure content mobility market is an emerging market, with a wide range of potential solution approaches. Established cloud-based data repositories and service providers compete for market share with TappIn. Some of these competitors have much stronger market positions than TappIn. The time and expense to market, sell and support the TappIn solution and possible future versions of the solution, introduce additional risk to current operations. Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of financial performance from TappIn or to realize other anticipated benefits of the acquisition. In addition, because acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that our previous, current, or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Our addition of subscription services, such as our cloud-based Managed Information Xchange and Hosted Enhanced File Transfer Server solutions announced in 2010 and early 2011, may adversely impact our prior revenue trends in the near term as some opportunities that otherwise would have materialized as software license sales potentially shift to subscription-based sales. Much of our revenue growth in recent years is attributable to sales of Enhanced File Transfer Server Enterprise software (and from maintenance and support contracts associated with Enhanced File Transfer Server Enterprise) and from delivery of our professional services. Software license sales typically are intended for implementations on customer premises and are recognized into revenue when delivery of the software has occurred and collection of fees from the customer is deemed probable. Because revenue from a subscription is recognized ratably, over the life of the subscription, changes in the proportion of sales from software licenses and from subscriptions may result in substantial changes in our revenue trends and other financial metrics. In practice, software sales typically are recognized into revenue within 30 to 90 days of the sale. Subscription services, on the other hand, are recognized into revenue as the services are delivered (assuming collection is deemed probable), typically on a monthly basis. Therefore, only a fraction of the total value of a subscription services sale is recognizable into revenue each month with the rest being included in deferred revenue. This fraction becomes less as the contract term increases from 12 to 24, or 36 months. 25 Table of Contents The impact of subscription services on prior revenue growth trends depends on several key factors, including the number of customers who may shift from software licenses to subscription services, and rate at which they may do so, the subscription term and fees, and the comparative value of the opportunity had it materialized as a software license sale instead of as a subscription service. Generally, for a fixed number of opportunities (that is, without considering the possibility that a new service offering may result in additional sales opportunities), addition of subscription services reduces revenue growth rates for several quarters for the associated solutions until cumulative subscription revenue increases and, potentially, surpasses comparable software license revenue. The revenue impacts are particularly pronounced early in the introduction of subscription services because there has been only a short time period for accumulation of the recurring revenue stream. Because we announced our subscription services in the second half of 2010, there is little historical basis for quantifying some of these key risk factors or assessing the extent to which availability of our new subscription services may, or may not, increase the total number of sales opportunities. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the impact of our cloud-based subscription services on our prior revenue growth trends. However, revenue derived from sales of our Enhanced File Transfer Server solution, the comparable on-premises software solution in our portfolio, is most subject to ongoing transitory risk from the introduction of these subscription services. Fluctuations in professional services revenue may be greater than experienced in previous reporting periods and have a disproportionate impact on our financial results. For example, increased professional services sales, especially to the government, may result in lower earnings as a percentage of revenue. Our solution portfolio includes software licenses, subscription services, and professional services. Because they are relatively labor intensive, professional services typically have substantially lower margins than software solutions and subscription services. However, these services represent a strategic capability that helps customers plan, implement, and sustain our solutions and also provide us with the demonstrated past performance necessary to participate in certain procurements. Professional services historically have been an immaterial contributor to our revenue and earnings, typically representing much less than five percent of our revenue. However, since the third quarter of 2010 we have added several engineers to the McLane Advanced Technology (MAT) industry team supporting the U.S. Armys Standard Army Maintenance SystemEnhanced (SAMS-E) program. We also may continue to adjust, up or down, our professional services support to the Army, and to other customers within the government and commercial sectors, in a given reporting period. Depending on our mix of software licenses, subscription, and professional services revenue in a given reporting period, our earnings as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from historical norms. For example, if we were to derive a relatively large (compared to historical norms) component of our revenue from professional services in a reporting period, earnings as percentage of revenue may decline in that period due to lower margin contribution from the labor-intensive services as compared to software license and subscription service revenue. If we are unable to develop and deliver new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable to continually improve the performance, features, and reliability of our existing products and services, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products, product upgrades, and services on a timely basis. We have in the past incurred, and we believe that we will continue to incur, significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive. Innovation, new product development, and go-to-market activities involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including:  Developing, sustaining, and appropriately leveraging market intelligence to identify areas of market need that offer potentially high return on investment for solution development; 26 Table of Contents  Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements, which may be longer than originally expected;  Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers;  Extending the operation of our products and services to new platforms and operating systems;  Entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience;  Managing new product and service strategies, including integrating our various security and file replication technologies, management solutions, customer service, and support into unified enterprise security and file replication solutions;  Incorporating acquired products and technologies;  Developing or expanding efficient sales channels; and  Obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products, including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, we could have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenues in return, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. For example, the development cycle for the appShield solution has been considerably longer than originally envisioned and market feedback may result in an extended cycle of further development. We also have experienced longer than expected development and ongoing quality assurance testing cycles for WAFS. Our indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and business operations. At December 31, 2011, we had a total of $7.0 million of indebtedness under our loan agreements. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:  our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes which may be impaired or not available on favorable terms;  covenants contained in our loan agreements require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business, including future business opportunities;  we may need a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and  our level of indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to competitive pressures if there is a downturn in our business or the economy in general, than our competitors with less debt. Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, acquisitions and/or, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to affect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all. 27 Table of Contents A breach of the terms and conditions of our loan agreements, including the inability to comply with the required financial covenants, could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs (after any applicable notice and cure periods), the lender would be entitled to accelerate the repayment of amounts outstanding (including accrued and unpaid interest and fees). Upon a default under the loan agreements, the lender could also foreclose against any collateral securing such obligations, which may be all or substantially all of our assets. If that occurred, we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern. We may not be able to compete effectively with larger, better-positioned companies, resulting in lower margins and loss of market share. We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments, market consolidation, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and product improvements by existing and new competitors. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors take or gain additional market share in any of our markets, our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop in revenues that could adversely affect our business and operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to competitor strategies as such strategies become apparent, and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed, used, and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands, we could experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our financial results. We compete with a variety of companies who have significantly greater revenues and financial resources, partners, resellers and distribution channels than GlobalSCAPE as well as greater personnel and technical resources. For example, the EFT Server solution suite competes with products from Sterling Commerce-IBM, Axway and several other vendors, and WAFS competes with Riverbed Technology and Cisco. Large companies may be able to develop new technologies, across multiple solution spaces, and on more operating systems, more quickly than we can, to offer a broader array of products, and to respond more quickly to new opportunities, industry standards or customer requirements. For example, Sterling Commerce receives substantial maintenance contract revenue annually, providing them with significant resources for product research, development and marketing. Additional competitors may enter the market and also may have significantly greater capabilities and resources than we do. Some existing competitors also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing strategies. For example, Ipswitch provides an older version of its consumer file transfer protocol program for free for non-commercial use, and Microsoft includes file transfer protocol functionality in its Internet browser, which it also distributes for free. Increased competition may result in lower operating margins and loss of market share. We may incur losses as we attempt to expand our business. We intend to expand our business and therefore expect to expend additional resources on continuing research and development, developing our sales force and a more robust reseller program, marketing, gaining traction in newly entered markets such as secure content mobility and cloud services, and potentially entering other new or adjacent markets. If we do not successfully develop and introduce the new solutions to the market, are unable to improve our direct and channel sales results, or are unable to enter expected new markets, we may not be able to achieve the revenue growth associated with the business expansion expenditures and may not be profitable. Maintenance revenue growth could decline. Our revenues derived from maintenance and support services have increased over the last three years as a result of a growing base of installed products and our continued focus on M&S contract renewals. Declines in our 28 Table of Contents license sales, adverse changes in our foreign currency exchange rates, increased discounting in maintenance renewal sales and/or a reduction in the extent to which our customers renew maintenance contracts would lead to declines in our maintenance revenue growth rates. As maintenance revenue makes up a substantial portion of our total revenue, any decline in our maintenance revenue could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations, which could result in errors or product failures. Addressing MFT, WAFS, CDP, Managed E-mail Attachment, cloud services, secure content mobility, and endpoint security market needs typically requires very complex products. Therefore, undetected errors, failures, or bugs may occur, especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products are often installed and used in large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our products. Our customers computing environments also are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us and others, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments. In the past, we have discovered software errors, failures, and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the time required to correct these errors. Errors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position, or claims by customers or others. Many of our end-user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other, less critical, software products. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end-user customers systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays, or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results. For example, it took longer than originally expected to make the necessary improvements to our WAFS solution and therefore WAFS revenues through 2009 were lower than originally anticipated. Turmoil and uncertainty in U.S. and international economic markets could adversely affect our business and operating results. Demand for our products depends in large part upon the level of capital and maintenance expenditures by many of our customers. The economic downturn in recent years has adversely impacted spending on information technology projects as prospects and customers reduce, sometimes greatly, their discretionary spending to focus on preserving mandatory spending budgets. These adverse impacts to customer spending may be directly, and adversely, reflected in our future business and operating results because we believe a substantial part of the MFT spending budget is considered discretionary by our prospects and customers. The perception of MFT solutions spending as discretionary is further reinforced by the existence of low cost, or even free, products that deliver some subset of the capabilities found in our solutions. Given the recent economic downturn, some customers may have decided to defer spending for our solutions or may have elected to obtain low cost or free good enough products as an interim measure. The potential adverse impacts of such decisions may persist for an extended period of time, even well into a period of economic recovery, given that many prospects will not change their IT infrastructure for a considerable period of time once that infrastructure has been installed and is operating adequately. 29 Table of Contents Adverse financial results from another economic downturn and uncertainty could include flat, or even decreasing, sales, lower gross and net margins, and impairment of current or future goodwill and long-lived assets. In addition, some of our customers could delay paying their obligations to us. Potentially reduced sales and margins and customer payment problems could limit our ability to fund research and development, marketing, sales, and other activities necessary to sustain and expand our market position. Finally, like many other companies, our stock price decreased during the onset of the economic downturn. If investors have concerns that our business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted by a continued or worsened worldwide economic downturn, our stock price could decrease again. Regardless of economic conditions, fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors, including competition, product obsolescence, technological change, budget constraints of our actual and potential customers, level of broadband usage, awareness of security threats to IT systems, and other factors. While such factors may, in some periods, increase product sales, fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales. If demand for our products declines, our revenues as well as our gross and net margins could be adversely affected. CuteFTP, in particular, competes in some ways with social media services for image and video sharing. As social media has increased exponentially in popularity, sales of our CuteFTP product line have continued to decline. Sales to the U.S. Government make up a portion of our business and changes in government defense spending could have consequences on our financial position, results of operations and business. In some recent years (2007 and 2009, for example) Government sales have accounted for 10% or more of our total sales. Our revenues from the U.S. Government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various U.S. Government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the Department of Defense (DoD). The funding of our programs is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events and macroeconomic conditions, and are beyond our control. The overall level of U.S. defense spending has increased in recent years for numerous reasons, including increases in funding of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the DoDs modernization initiatives. Looking forward, we expect overall defense spending to remain relatively flat in the near term, given the military withdrawal from Iraq in December 2011 and the expected drawdown of military operations in Afghanistan. However, projected defense spending levels are uncertain and become increasingly difficult to predict for periods beyond the near-term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, funding for ongoing operations in Afghanistan, future priorities of the Administration and the overall health of the U.S. and world economies and the state of governmental finances. Significant changes in defense spending could have long-term consequences for our size and structure. In addition, changes in government priorities and requirements could impact the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Larger government contracts, such as the Army contracts we were awarded in 2007 and 2009, typically have long sales cycles. Therefore, closure of such contracts is difficult to predict, increasing uncertainty in our projections. U.S. Government contracts generally also permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the governments convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor. 30 Table of Contents Finally, because we are a DoD contractor, certain GlobalSCAPE items and/or transactions may be subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) if our software or services are specifically designed or modified for defense purposes. Companies engaged in manufacturing or exporting ITAR-controlled goods and services (even if these companies do not export such items) are required to register with the U.S. State Department. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines and sanctions which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers, our operating results could be adversely affected. We sell our products to customers primarily through our direct sales force and through resellers. Sales through these different channels involve distinct risks, including the following: Direct Sales. Most of our revenue is derived from sales by our direct sales force to end-users. Special risks associated with this sales channel include:  Longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts;  Difficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales force;  Substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive, including regular updates to cover new and revised products; and  Reliance on leads obtained from paid advertising (for example, Google ads) could materially impact direct sales should advertising effectiveness decline due to non-attributable declines in leads, unforeseen search engine algorithm changes, or other occurrences that may adversely impact the lead generation aspects of the direct sales cycle. In addition, increased competition may materially impact the costs associated with such advertising. Indirect Sales Channels. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales through indirect channels, including distributors and partners that sell our products to end-users and other resellers. This channel involves a number of risks, including:  Our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end-users;  Our resellers and distributors currently are not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers;  Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause; and  Our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may, from time to time, place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing, promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors. We cannot be certain that our distribution channel partners will continue to market or sell our products effectively. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues. If we lose key personnel we may not be able to execute our business plan. Our future success depends on the continued services of key members of our management team. These individuals are difficult to replace because of the intense competition for similarly skilled people. In addition, new members of the management team may not be productive for weeks or months as they learn about our solutions, our personnel, and the administrative practices within GlobalSCAPE. 31 Table of Contents Failure to maintain proper and effective internal controls, could affect our ability to produce accurate financial statements, which could result in the restatement of our financial statements or adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our stock price. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we are unable to establish and maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our Common Stock. Our ability to develop our software will be seriously impaired if we are not able to use our foreign subcontractors. We rely on foreign subcontractors to help us develop some aspects of some of our software. If these programmers decided to stop working for us, or if we were unable to continue using them because of political or economic instability, we would have difficulty finding comparably skilled developers in a timely manner. In addition, we would likely have to pay considerably more for the same work, especially if we used U.S. personnel. If we could not replace the contract programmers, it would take us significantly longer to develop certain products and product upgrades. It may be difficult for us to recruit and retain software developers and other technical and management personnel because we are a relatively small company. We compete intensely with other software development and distribution companies internationally and IT departments supporting larger businesses to recruit and hire from a limited pool of qualified personnel. Some qualified candidates prefer to work for larger, better known companies or in another geographic area. In order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. The volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. In addition, we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans. Also, accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equity-based compensation as compensation expense. As a result, we may decide to issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Key personnel have left our Company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future. The loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and the results of our operations. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement sales, engineering, and other personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues. 32 Table of Contents Our operations potentially are vulnerable to security breaches that could harm the quality of our products and services or disrupt our ability to deliver our products and services. Information security is a dynamic discipline that historically has faced a threat that develops and emerges in sometimes-unpredictable ways. Third parties may breach our system and information security and damage our products and services or misappropriate confidential customer information. This might cause us to lose customers, or even cause customers to make claims against us for damages. In addition, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against potential or actual security breaches and/or to address problems caused by such breaches. Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. While we have derived the majority of our historical revenues from on premise delivery of our products, we are increasingly offering our products on third party hosted platforms As we continue to execute our strategy of increasing the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. This environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls. Despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. We believe customers using our subscription services will increasingly want efficient, centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data. Perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could constrain consumer and business adoption of cloud-based solutions. We utilize open source software in some of our products. The open source software community develops software technology for free use by anyone. We incorporate a limited amount of open source code software into our products. For example, we have relied on open source technology for the encryption features in our CuteFTP Pro, EFT Server, and Mail Express solutions. We may use more open source code software in the future. Our use, in some instances, of open source code software may impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions and may subject us to possible intellectual property litigation. Open source code may impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products because, among other reasons, open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our solution, and open source software cannot be protected under trade secret law. In addition, it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. From time to time companies that incorporate open source software into their products have been subject to such claims. Claims of infringement or misappropriation against us could be costly for us to defend and could require us to re-engineer our solution or to seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solution. We also might need to discontinue the sale of our solution in the event re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely or cost-effective basis. If any such claim, attempted remediation, or solution discontinuance occur, our business and operating results could be harmed. 33 Table of Contents Our products may expose customers to invasion of privacy, causing customer dissatisfaction. Our EFT Server suite, Mail Express, and TappIn solutions are intended to facilitate information sharing, sometimes by providing outsiders access to a customers computer. Such access potentially may make the customer vulnerable to security breaches, which could result in the loss of their privacy or property. Similarly, appShield is intended to block execution of malicious software, typically serving as a last line of defense alongside traditional antivirus solutions. Invasions of privacy or other customer harm occurring in an environment where our solutions are operating could result in customer dissatisfaction and possible claims against us for any resulting damages. Increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. We offer technical support services with many of our products. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers. Further customer demand for these services could increase our costs and, without corresponding increasing revenues, adversely affect our operating results. We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets. All products that are exported, re-exported or that are worked on by foreign nationals are subject to export controls. Such controls include prohibitions on end uses, end users and country prohibitions. In addition, incorporation of encryption technology into our products can increase the level of U.S. export controls. The encryptions export controls were modified last year. We are subject to these requirements as certain of our products include the ability for the end user to encrypt data. Therefore, our products may be exported outside the United States or revealed to foreign nations only with the required level of export controls/restrictions. Restrictions applicable to our products may include: the requirement to have a license to export the technology; the requirement to have software licenses approved before export is allowed; and outright bans on the licensing of certain encryption technology to particular end users or to all end users in a particular country. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers ability to implement our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining the licenses and other authorizations required to export our products from applicable government authorities. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the list of countries to which we cannot export, changes in persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Export laws and regulations can be extremely complex in their application. If we are found not to have complied with applicable export control laws, we may be sanctioned, fined or penalized by, among other things, having our ability to obtain export licenses curtailed or eliminated, possibly for an extended period of time. Our failure to receive or maintain any required export licenses or authorizations or our penalization for failure to comply with applicable export control laws would hinder our ability to sell our products, could result in financial 34 Table of Contents penalties, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any failure on our part or the part of our distributors to comply with encryption or other applicable export control requirements which could harm our business and operating results. Finally, import and export regulations of encryption/decryption technology vary from country to country. We may be subject to different statutory or regulatory controls in different foreign jurisdictions, and as such, our technology may not be permitted in these foreign jurisdictions. Violations of foreign regulations or regulation of international transactions could prevent us from being able to sell our products in international markets. Our success depends in large part to having access to international markets. A violation of foreign regulations could limit our access to such markets and have a negative effect on our results of operations. As our international sales grow, we could become increasingly subject to additional risks that could harm our business. We conduct significant sales and customer support, in countries outside of the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 31% of our sales were to purchasers outside the United States. Our continued growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations. To successfully expand international sales, we must establish additional foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers. In addition, there is significant competition for entry into high growth markets, such as China. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, which could cause fluctuations in the results of our international operations. These risks include:  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements;  variability of foreign economic, political and labor conditions;  changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers or by U.S. export laws;  longer accounts receivable payment cycles;  potentially adverse tax consequences;  difficulties in protecting intellectual property;  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws; and  as we generate cash flow in non-U.S. jurisdictions, if required, we may experience difficulty transferring such funds to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner. Risks Related to Stock Ownership Our stock price is/may be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to certain factors, including:  U.S. and global economic conditions leading to general declines in market capitalizations, with such declines not associated with operating performance;  Quarter-to-quarter variations in results of operations;  Our announcements of new products;  Our announcements of acquisitions;  Our announcements of significant new customers or contracts;  Our competitors announcements of new products; 35 Table of Contents  Our product development or release schedule;  General conditions in the software industry; and  Investor perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic position and those of our competitors and customers. In addition, the public stock markets experience extreme price and trading volume volatility particularly in high-technology sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. The broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our annual or quarterly financial results. Our financial results may be affected by non-cash and other accounting charges, including:  Amortization of intangible assets, including acquired technology and product rights;  Acquisition expenses;  Impairment of goodwill and intangibles;  Stock-based compensation expense;  Restructuring charges; and  Impairment of long-lived assets Anti-takeover provisions in our charter and Delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us. Some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in Delaware law could, together or separately:  Discourage potential acquisition proposals;  Delay or prevent a change in control; and  Limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws prohibit stockholders from voting by written consent or calling meetings of the stockholders. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in the statute, for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Our directors and executive officers continue to have substantial control over us. Our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 44% of our outstanding common stock at December 31, 2011. As a result, these stockholders would have the ability to control GlobalSCAPE and direct its policies including the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, such as the election of directors and any acquisition or merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for our Board of Directors to be divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms. As a result, approximately one-third of our Board of Directors will be elected each year. 36 Table of Contents Stockholders ownership of our stock may be significantly diluted, affecting the value of the stock. There were options for 4,490,895 shares outstanding under our employee and director stock option plans as of March 1, 2012, of which 2,407,029 were vested. We have filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, covering stock issued upon the exercise of options by non-affiliates, and we may file a registration statement covering options held by affiliates as well. If we do not file a registration statement covering affiliates, affiliates who exercise their options may choose to sell the stock under an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The exercise of these options and sale of the resulting stock could depress the value of our stock. Risks Related to Intellectual Property We are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third-party intellectual property rights particularly because our products are partially developed by independent parties. From time to time we experience claims that our products infringe third-party intellectual property rights. We may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that some of the code in our products is developed by independent parties or licensed from third parties over whom we have less control than we exercise over internal developers. In addition, we expect that infringement claims against software developers will become more prevalent as the number of products and developers grows and the functionality of software programs in the market increasingly overlaps. Companies in the technology industry, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Responding to and defending against such claims may cause us to incur significant expense and divert the time and efforts of our management and employees. Successful assertion of such claims could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from selling our products and services, damage our reputation, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms, any of which could materially harm our business. In addition, we may decide to pay substantial settlement costs in connection with any claim or litigation, whether or not successfully asserted. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incident to our business, defense costs may be significant and we believe the costs associated with this litigation or other claims of infringement could generally have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. For any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, we may have to pay damages and indemnify our customers against damages. Claims of infringement could require us to re-engineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering its products. In addition, an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property, or the use of significant resources to defend against this type of claim could place a significant strain on our financial resources and harm our reputation. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. Our software code, and trade and service marks are some of our most valuable assets. Given the global nature of the internet and our business, we are vulnerable to the misappropriation of this intellectual property, particularly in foreign markets, such as China and Eastern Europe, where laws or law enforcement practices are less developed. The global nature of the internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security 37 Table of Contents of our software making it more likely that unauthorized third parties will copy certain portions of our proprietary information or reverse engineer the proprietary information used in its programs. If our proprietary rights were infringed by a third-party, and we did not have adequate legal recourse, our ability to earn profits, which are highly dependent on those rights, would be severely diminished. Other companies may own, obtain or claim trademarks that could prevent, limit or interfere with our use of our trademarks. Our various trademarks are important to our business. If we were to lose the use of any of our trademarks, our business would be harmed and we would have to devote substantial resources towards developing an independent brand identity. Defending or enforcing our trademark rights at a local and international level could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Item 1B.
