ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with the SEC, before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could change. Under these circumstances, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities. THE DEBTORS EXPECT TO FILE A PROPOSED PLAN TO RESOLVE THEIR PRESENT AND FUTURE ASBESTOS PERSONAL INJURY LIABILITIES PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF ASBESTOS PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMANTS (OR ACC) AND THE FUTURES REPRESENTATIVE. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE PROPOSED PLAN WILL BE CONFIRMED. IF THE PROPOSED PLAN, OR A SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PLAN, IS NOT CONFIRMED, THE INTERESTS OF THE DEBTORS' CREDITORS AND STOCKHOLDERS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY PLAN OF REORGANIZATION ULTIMATELY CONFIRMED, AND THE INTERESTS OF THE CORPORATION'S STOCKHOLDERS MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED OR CANCELLED IN WHOLE OR IN PART. EVEN IF THE PROPOSED PLAN IS CONFIRMED, THE CORPORATION'S PAYMENTS TO THE ASBESTOS PERSONAL INJURY TRUST WILL VARY SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDING UPON WHETHER FEDERAL ASBESTOS TRUST FUND LEGISLATION IS ENACTED, OR IS ENACTED BUT FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. PASSAGE OF SUCH LEGISLATION IS EXTREMELY SPECULATIVE AND NOT WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION. Pursuant to the Asbestos Agreement with the ACC and the Futures Representative, the Debtors expect to file a Proposed Plan in February 2006 pursuant to which the Debtors propose to resolve their present and future asbestos personal injury liabilities through the creation and funding of an asbestos personal injury trust under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. If the Proposed Plan is confirmed, all present and future asbestos personal injury claims against the Debtors would be channeled to the trust, and no individual or entity may thereafter bring an asbestos personal injury claim against Debtors. The amount that the Debtors must pay to the Section 524(g) asbestos personal injury trust would depend upon whether national legislation creating a trust for payment of asbestos personal injury claims is enacted into law by the 10th day after final adjournment of the 109th Congress. If the legislation is enacted by that date, the Debtors' funding obligation to the Section 524(g) trust would be $900 million. If such legislation is not enacted before that date, or is enacted but held unconstitutional, the Debtors' funding obligation to the Section 524(g) trust would total $3.95 billion. The Asbestos Agreement is subject to numerous conditions. One of the conditions of the Asbestos Agreement is that the Proposed Plan be confirmed and effective no later than August 1, 2006. There is no guarantee that the Proposed Plan will be confirmed or become effective. If the Proposed Plan is not confirmed, the Debtors will remain in chapter 11, the amount of Debtors' present and future asbestos personal injury liabilities will be unresolved, and the terms and timing of any plan of reorganization 8 ultimately confirmed in the Debtors' Chapter 11 Cases are unknown. In such a situation, it cannot be known what amount will be necessary to resolve Debtors' present and future asbestos personal injury liabilities, how the plan of reorganization ultimately approved will treat other pre-petition claims, whether there will be sufficient assets to satisfy Debtors' pre-petition liabilities, and what impact any plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed may have on the value of the shares of the Corporation's common stock or other securities. The interests of the Corporation's stockholders may be substantially diluted or cancelled in whole or in part. The Asbestos Agreement does not resolve asbestos property damage claims. Currently, approximately 900 proofs of claim alleging asbestos property damage are pending. Under the Proposed Plan, asbestos property damage claims would be separately resolved in the bankruptcy proceedings or other forum, where appropriate. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11, and Note 18, Litigation, for additional information on the bankruptcy proceeding, including the potential impacts of asbestos litigation on those proceedings. AS A RESULT OF THE CHAPTER 11 CASES, OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE INDICATIVE OF OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our capital structure may be significantly changed by any plan of reorganization. Under fresh start accounting rules that may, or may not, apply to us upon the effective date of any plan of reorganization, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and retained earnings would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh start accounting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Corporation will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11, there is significant uncertainty as to the resolution of our asbestos litigation, which, among other things, may lead to possible changes in the composition of our business portfolio, as well as changes in the ownership of the Corporation. This uncertainty raises substantial doubt about the Corporation's ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans concerning this matter also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our historical financial information will not be indicative of our financial performance following approval of any plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court. Under American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code," all of our outstanding debt is classified as liabilities subject to compromise, and interest expense on this debt has not been accrued or recorded since June 25, 2001 (the "Petition Date"). From the Petition Date through December 31, 2005, contractual interest expense not accrued or recorded on pre-petition debt totaled $337 million. This calculation excludes the impact of any compounding of interest on unpaid interest that may be payable under the relevant contractual obligations, as well as any interest that may be payable under a plan of reorganization to trade or other creditors that are not otherwise entitled to interest under the express terms of their claims. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of any plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and similar charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the Corporation in any given period. DEBTOR U.S. GYPSUM HAS SIGNIFICANT ASBESTOS PERSONAL INJURY LIABILITIES, AND THE ACC AND FUTURES REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM THAT OTHER DEBTORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASBESTOS PERSONAL INJURY LIABILITIES AS WELL. THE PROPOSED PLAN WILL ESTABLISH THE POSSIBLE AMOUNT THAT DEBTORS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY INTO A SECTION 524(g) ASBESTOS PERSONAL INJURY TRUST TO SATISFY ALL LIABILITIES FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE ASBESTOS PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST DEBTORS, INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST DEBTORS RELATING TO A.P. GREEN REFRACTORIES, INC., A FORMER SUBSIDIARY OF U.S. GYPSUM AND THE CORPORATION. HOWEVER, IF THE PROPOSED PLAN IS NOT CONFIRMED, THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBTORS' ASBESTOS PERSONAL INJURY LIABILITIES WILL NOT BE RESOLVED AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL DISPUTE AND UNCERTAINTY. 9 As a result of the Asbestos Agreement and Proposed Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2005, the Corporation recorded a pretax charge of $3.1 billion ($1.935 billion, or $44.36 per share, after tax) for all asbestos-related claims, increasing the reserve for all asbestos-related claims to $4.161 billion. This reserve includes the Debtors' obligations to fund asbestos personal injury claims as will be set forth in the Proposed Plan (recorded at $3.95 billion on the assumption that the Proposed Plan is confirmed but that the FAIR Act or substantially similar legislation is not enacted as set forth in the Proposed Plan). This reserve also includes the Debtors' estimate of the cost of resolving asbestos property damage claims filed in its chapter 11 proceedings, including estimated legal fees associated with those claims; and the Debtors' estimate of resolving other asbestos-related claims and legal expenses associated with those claims. If the Proposed Plan is not confirmed, the amount of Debtors' asbestos personal injury liabilities will not be resolved and will likely be subject to substantial dispute and uncertainty. In that event, if the amount of such liabilities is not resolved through negotiation or through federal asbestos legislation, such liabilities likely will be determined by the Court through an estimation proceeding in the Chapter 11 Cases. The ACC and the Futures Representative have stated in a court filing that they estimate that the net present value of the Debtors' liability for present and future asbestos personal injury liabilities is approximately $5.5 billion and that the Debtors are insolvent. The Debtors have stated that they believe they are solvent if their asbestos liabilities are fairly and appropriately valued. If the Proposed Plan is not confirmed, the amount of Debtors' asbestos personal injury liabilities could ultimately be determined to be significantly different from the currently accrued reserve. This difference could be material to the Corporation's financial position, cash flows and results of operations in the period recorded. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11, and Note 18, Litigation, for additional information on the bankruptcy proceeding and litigation matters. OUR FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. The optimum level of future indebtedness will be contingent on the capital structure of the Corporation under a plan of reorganization or in connection with developments thereafter. Our indebtedness could have significant adverse effects on our business. Such adverse effects could include, but are not limited to, the following: - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt service obligations; - increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general operating requirements; - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with stronger liquidity positions, thereby hurting our results of operations and ability to meet our debt service obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and - limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our outstanding indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds. OUR BUSINESSES ARE CYCLICAL IN NATURE, AND PROLONGED PERIODS OF WEAK DEMAND OR EXCESS SUPPLY MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. Our businesses are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including, in particular, conditions in the housing and construction-based markets. Prices for our products and services are affected by overall supply and demand in the market for our products and for our competitors' products. In particular, market prices of building 10 products historically have been volatile and cyclical, and we, like other producers, may have limited ability to control the timing and amount of pricing changes for our products. Prolonged periods of weak demand or excess supply in any of our businesses could negatively affect our revenues and margins and harm our liquidity, financial condition and operating results. The markets that we serve, including, in particular, the housing and construction-based markets, are significantly affected by the movement of interest rates. Significantly higher interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our business is also affected by a variety of other factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, employment levels, foreign currency exchange rates, office vacancy rates, unforeseen inflationary pressures and consumer confidence. Since our operations occur in a variety of geographic markets, our businesses are subject to the economic conditions in each such geographic market. General economic downturns or localized downturns in the regions where we have operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. THE SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS. A majority of our business is seasonal with peak sales typically occurring from spring through the middle of autumn. Quarterly results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. Such variations could have a negative impact on our financial performance and the trading prices of our common stock or our other securities. WE FACE COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES. IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We face competition in each of our operating segments. Principal methods of competition include quality of products, service, location, pricing, compatibility of systems, range of products and product design features. Aggressive actions by our competitors could lead to lower pricing by us in order to compete. To achieve and/or maintain leadership positions in key product categories, we must continue to develop brand recognition and loyalty, enhance product quality and performance, and develop our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We also compete through our use of information technology and expect to continue to improve our systems. We need to provide customers with timely, accurate, easy-to-access information about product availability, orders and delivery status using state-of-the-art systems in order to maintain our market share. While we may use manual processes for short-term failures and disaster recovery capability, a prolonged disruption of systems or other failure to meet customers' expectations for the capabilities and reliability of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations, particularly during any prolonged period of disruption. We intend to continue making investments in research and development to develop new and improved products and more-efficient production methods. We believe we need to continue to develop new products and improve our existing products and production efficiency in order to maintain our market leadership position. A failure to continue making such investments could restrain our revenue growth and harm our operating results and market share. In addition, even if we are able to invest sufficient resources in research and development, these investments may not generate net sales that exceed our expenses, generate any net sales at all or result in any commercially acceptable products. IF COSTS OF KEY RAW MATERIALS OR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS INCREASE, OR THE AVAILABILITY OF KEY RAW MATERIALS DECREASES, OUR COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD WILL INCREASE, AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. The cost and availability of raw materials and energy are critical to our operations. For example, we use substantial quantities of gypsum, wastepaper, mineral fiber, steel, perlite, starch and high pressure laminates. The cost of these items has been volatile, and availability has sometimes been limited. We source some of these materials from a limited number of suppliers, which increases the risk of unavailability. Furthermore, we may not be able to pass increased raw materials prices on to our customers if the market or existing agreements with our clients do not allow us to raise the prices of our finished products. If price adjustments significantly trail the increase in raw materials prices or if we cannot effectively hedge 11 against price increases, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. Wastepaper prices are affected by market conditions, principally supply. We buy various grades of wastepaper, and shortages occur periodically in one or more grades and may vary among geographic regions. As a result, we have experienced, and expect in the future to experience, volatility in wastepaper availability and its cost, affecting the mix of products manufactured at particular locations or the cost of producing them. Energy costs also are affected by various market factors, including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices, and local and national regulatory decisions. Prices for natural gas and electrical power, which are significant components of the costs associated with our gypsum and interior systems products, have increased significantly in recent years. Transportation costs associated with our gypsum and interior systems products are a significant portion of the variable cost of the North American Gypsum, Worldwide Ceilings and Building Products Distribution segments. Significant increases in the cost of fuel or energy can result in material increases in the cost of transportation, which could materially and adversely affect our operating profits. There can be no assurance that there will not be substantial increases in the price or a decline in the availability of energy in the future, especially in light of recent instability in some energy markets, or, as is the case with raw materials, that we can pass on any such increases through increases in the price of our products. About 26% of the gypsum used in our plants is synthetic gypsum, which is a byproduct resulting primarily from flue gas desulphurization carried out by electric generation or industrial plants burning coal as a fuel. The suppliers of this kind of gypsum are primarily power companies, which are required to operate scrubbing equipment for their coal-fired generating plants under federal environmental regulations. Environmental regulatory changes or other factors affecting the operations of the plants could have an impact on the price and availability of synthetic gypsum. In addition, our profit margins are affected by costs related to maintaining our employee benefit plans (pension and medical insurance for active employees and retirees). The recognition of costs and liabilities associated with these plans for financial reporting purposes is affected by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the annual expense recognized for these plans. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates primarily include discount rates, expected return on plan assets for the funded plans, compensation increase rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and, for postretirement benefits, health-care-cost trend rates. Economic factors and conditions could affect multiple assumptions and may affect our estimated and actual employee benefit plan costs and our business, financial condition and operating results. WE ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE RISK FROM FIXED-PRICE SUPPLY AGREEMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS IF THE MARKET PRICE DROPS, PUTTING US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. We seek to reduce the impact of fluctuations in natural gas prices through use of hedging instruments or fixed-price contracts. The principal risk is that we might pay more than market price if the market price drops below the hedged price and our costs might increase relative to our competitors. We may determine at any time to discontinue fixed-price arrangements if necessary. Alternatively, if the market increases, this is a benefit. Over time, our costs could be greater than or less than the prevailing market price. THE LOSS OF SALES TO ONE OR MORE OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. We face strong competition for our major customers. If one or more of our major customers reduces, delays or cancels substantial orders for any reason, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected, particularly for the quarter in which the delay or cancellation occurs. CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN EXPANDING AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPAND THROUGH CONSOLIDATION AND INTERNAL GROWTH, THEREBY POSSIBLY DEVELOPING INCREASED BUYING POWER OVER US, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Certain of our important customers are large companies with significant buying power over suppliers. In addition, potential further consolidation in the distribution channels could enhance the ability of 12 certain of our customers to seek more favorable terms, including pricing, for the products that they purchase from us. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or raise prices in the future may be limited, including during periods of raw material and other costs increases. If we are forced to reduce prices or to maintain prices during periods of increased costs, or if we lose customers because of pricing or other methods of competition, our revenues and results of operations could be negatively affected. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY REGULATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND COULD CAUSE US TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO HOW WE MANUFACTURE AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating air emissions, wastewater discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. If we were to violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could incur fines, penalties or other sanctions. In addition, we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials. Environmental laws tend to become more stringent over time, and we could incur material expenses in the future relating to compliance with future environmental laws. In addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use, including synthetic gypsum, may vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting certain of our suppliers. An increase in the price of our raw materials, a decline in their availability or future costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws could negatively affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. WE DEPEND ON OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM FOR THEIR EXPERTISE AND LEADERSHIP, AND THE LOSS OF ANY MEMBER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. Our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team. The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy. Although the Corporation has a retention program as an incentive for management to stay with the Corporation during its Chapter 11 proceedings, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain all our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. No dividends are being paid on the common stock of the Corporation during the pendency of our bankruptcy proceedings. Further, our ability to pay cash dividends on the common stock may be restricted under our financing arrangements following our emergence from bankruptcy. NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Future disasters caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terrorist attacks or other events, and any potential response by the U.S. government or military, could have a significant adverse effect on the general economic, market and political conditions, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.
