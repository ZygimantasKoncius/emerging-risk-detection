RISK FACTORS For information on risk factors, reference is made to our Annual Report 2012 Risk overview on page 43. In addition to the risks included in the Risk overview in our Annual Report 2012, we may be subject to other material risks that as of the date of this report are not currently known to us or that we deem less material at this time. Such risks include the risk that our IT security system may not prevent all forms of unauthorized access to our computer network systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, trade secrets or sensitive information, and the risks arising from current macro-economic conditions including the impact of fiscal austerity measures on our customers. PCAOB INSPECTION OF OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS With Novo Nordisk being a public company listed in the U.S, our independent public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and therefore required to undergo regular PCAOB inspections to assess the registered accounting firms compliance with U.S. law and professional standards in connection with its audits of financial statements filed with the SEC. The PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of Danish auditors audit work and procedures without the approval of the Danish authorities, which prevents it from regularly evaluating our auditors audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, investors who rely on our auditors audit report are deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections of our auditor. 4 Back to Contents
