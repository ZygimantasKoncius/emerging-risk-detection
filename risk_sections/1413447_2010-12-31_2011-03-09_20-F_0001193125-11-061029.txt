We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements and disclaim any obligation to update our view of any risks or uncertainties described herein or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to the forward-looking statements made in this annual report, except as required by law. In addition, this annual report contains information concerning the semiconductor industry and business segments generally, which is forward-looking in nature and is based on a variety of assumptions regarding the ways in which the semiconductor industry, our market and business segments will develop. We have based these assumptions on information currently available to us, including through the market research and industry reports referred to in this annual report. Although we believe that this information is reliable, we have not independently verified and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. If any one or more of these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, actual market results may differ from those predicted. While we do not know what impact any such differences may have on our business, if there are such differences, they could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock. Subsequent events Potential Secondary Offering of Common Stock On or about March 9, 2011, we will file a registration statement with the SEC for a potential secondary offering of our shares of common stock. Share Based Compensation Plans On or about March 9, 2011, we will file a registration statement with the SEC in relation to the Management Equity Stock Option Plan, the Global Equity Incentive Program and the Long Term Incentive plan 2010, which we introduced in November 2010. Following the filing of such registration statement, pursuant to our Management Equity Stock Option Plan, members of our management team and certain other executives will be allowed to exercise, from time to time, their vested options. The proportion of options available for exercise cannot exceed the proportion of the aggregate number of shares of common stock sold by our co-investors, including the Private Equity Consortium, to the total number of shares of common stock owned by such co-investors. We expect that following the completion of this offering, up to 15% of the vested options under the Management Equity Stock Option Plan will become exercisable, subject to the applicable laws and regulations. Term Loan On March 4, 2011, we entered into a $500 million Term Loan to finance general corporate purposes (including refinancing or repaying indebtedness). Utilization of the Term Loan is subject to satisfaction of 81 customary closing conditions. Loans under the Term Loan are denominated in U.S. dollars and bear interest at a rate per annum (calculated on a 360 day basis or, in respect of Alternate Base Rate (ABR) loans calculated on the basis of the prime rate, a 365 day basis) (i) in the case of LIBOR loans, equal to LIBOR plus 3.25% (provided that LIBOR shall be deemed not to be less than 1.25%) and (ii) in the case of Alternate Base Rate (ABR) loans, equal to ABR (the higher of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus 2.25%. The Term Loan will amortize in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the aggregate initial principal amount with the balance payable on the final maturity date. The Term Loan has substantially the same covenants as our existing Secured Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the Term Loan, on March 7, 2011 we issued redemption notices for all $362 million outstanding of our 2014 Dollar Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2014, together with $100 million of our Dollar Floating Rate Secured Notes and 143 million of our Euro Floating Rate Secured Notes. The redemptions will be conditional on the receipt of proceeds from the new term loan facility. Item 6. Management A.

B. Compensation. In accordance with Dutch law, our stockholders have adopted a compensation policy for the board of directors. The remuneration of our executive directors is resolved upon by our board of directors, with due observance of our compensation policy. The respective executive director does not participate in the discussions of our board of directors on his compensation, nor does the chief executive officer vote on such a matter. Our chief executive officer is our only executive director. The remuneration of the non-executive directors has been resolved upon by our stockholders at a stockholder meeting at the proposal of our board of directors, prior to the consummation of the initial public offering in August 2010. To the extent the stockholders at a future stockholder meeting do not adopt the proposal of the board, the board must prepare a new proposal. After adoption of a proposal, only subsequent amendments will require stockholder approval. Furthermore, any proposed share or option-based director compensation (including any performance conditions relating to such compensation) must be submitted by our board to the general meeting of stockholders for its approval, detailing the number of shares or options over shares that may be awarded to the directors and the criteria that apply to such award or any modification of such rights. Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering in August 2010, our stockholders have approved such equity-based director compensation. Compensation Policy and Objectives The objective in establishing the compensation policies for our chief executive officer, the other members of our management team and our other executives, will be to provide a compensation package that is aligned with our strategic goals and that enables us to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified professionals. We believe that the best way to achieve this is by linking executive compensation to individual performance targets, on the one hand, and to NXPs performance, on the other hand. Our executive compensation package will therefore include a significant variable part, consisting of an annual cash incentive and depositary receipts for shares and stock options. Executive performance targets will be determined annually, at the beginning of the year, and assessed at the end of the year by, respectively, our nominating and compensation committee, our executive officers or the other members of our management team. The compensation package for our chief executive officer, the other members of our management team and our NXP executives is benchmarked on a regular basis against other companies in the high-tech and semiconductors industry. 86 Base Salary We currently pay our chief executive officer an annual base salary of 1,142,000, the chairman of our board of directors an annual fixed fee of 275,000 and the other members of our board of directors an annual fixed fee of $85,000 gross. Members of our Audit Committee and the Nominating & Compensation Committee receive an additional annual fixed fee of $6,000 gross and the chairmen of both committees receive an additional annual fixed fee of $10,000 and $8,000 gross, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the members of our management team as a group received a total aggregate compensation of 6,200,000, compared to a total aggregate compensation of 6,680,000 in 2009. Our chief executive officer, the other members of our management team and most of our executives have a contract of employment for an indefinite term. The main elements of any new employment contract that we will enter into with a member of the board of directors will be made public no later than the date of the public notice convening the general meeting of stockholders at which the appointment of such member of the board of directors will be proposed. Annual Incentive Each year, our chief executive officer, the other members of our management team and our other executives can qualify to earn a variable cash incentive, subject to whether certain specific and challenging performance targets have been met. For our chief executive officer, the on-target cash incentive percentage was set at 100% of the base salary, with the maximum cash incentive set at 200% of the annual base salary. The cash incentive pay-out in any year relates to the achievements of the preceding financial year in relation to agreed targets. In 2010, an amount of 2,284,000 has been paid to our chief executive officer as annual incentive bonus for our performance in 2009. The total annual incentive bonus amount paid in 2010 to members of our management team, including our chief executive officer, is 9,830,000. In 2009, no annual incentive bonuses were paid to our board members, management team or to the executives due to the economic and financial crisis during the course of 2008 and early 2009, as well as our performance and the continuing future uncertainty in economic developments. Share Based Compensation Plans The purpose of our share based compensation plans, including the Management Equity Stock Option Plan implemented prior to the consummation of our initial public offering in August 2010 and the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2010 introduced in November 2010, is to align the interests of management with those of our stockholders by providing additional incentives to improve our medium and long term performance, by offering the participants an opportunity to share in the success of NXP. We granted stock options to the members of our management team and to approximately 135 of our other executives in 2007 and 2008 under the Management Equity Stock Option Plan. In May 2009, we executed a stock option exchange program, under which stock options, with new exercise prices, different volumes andin certain casesrevised vesting schedules, were granted to eligible individuals, in exchange for their owned stock options. By accepting the new stock options all previously granted stock options (vested and unvested) owned by the eligible individual were cancelled. As of May 2009, when the stock options exchange program was consummated, stock options have been granted to eligible individuals under the revised Management Equity Stock Option Plan. Under this stock option plan the participants acquire the right to purchase a certain number of shares of common stock at a predetermined price, i.e. exercise price, provided that certain conditions are met. The stock options have a vesting schedule as specified upon the grant to the individuals. Following the filing of such registration statement, pursuant to our Management Equity Stock Option Plan, members of our management team and certain other executives will be allowed to exercise, from time to time, their vested options. The proportion of options available for exercise cannot exceed the proportion of the aggregate number of shares of common stock sold by our co-investors, including the Private Equity Consortium, to the total number of shares of common stock owned by such co-investors. We expect that following the completion of this offering, up to 15% of the vested options under the Management Equity Stock Option Plan will become exercisable, subject to the 87 applicable laws and regulations. In the event of a change of control, participants may exercise (in particular, the Private Equity Consortium no longer jointly holding 30% of our common stock). As of December 31, 2010, a total of 18 million stock options were granted under the Management Equity Stock Option Plan to a group of approximately 125 (current and former) NXP executives (which includes our chief executive officer and the other members of the management team and our chairman of the board of directors). These stock options can be exercised at exercise prices which vary from 2.00 to 50.00 per stock option. In November 2010, we introduced a new Long Term Incentive Plan 2010, under which performance stock, restricted stock and stock options may be granted to the members of our board of directors, management team, our other executives, selected other key employees/talents of the NXP group and selected new hires. Under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2010, equity incentives may be granted on the dates NXP publishes its quarterly financials, beginning on November 2, 2010. Performance stock and restricted stock vest over a period of three years, subject to relevant performance criteria being met, and stock options vest over four years. The size of the annual equity pool available for Long Term Incentive Plan 2010 awards from November 2, 2010 up to the fourth quarter of 2011 is for an aggregate of up to 7,200,000 common shares in our share capital. On December 31, 2010, grants were made to 980 participants, in total representing 5,880,000 shares of common stock, consisting of 847,000 performance stock, 1,283,000 restricted shares and 3,750,000 stock options. Shares to be delivered under any equity program may be newly issued, for up to 10% of our share capital, or they may come out of treasury stock or be purchased from time to time upon the decision of our board of directors. As of December 31, 2010, the following stock options, restricted stock, performance stock, shares of common stock, depositary receipts for shares of common stock were outstanding with members of our board of directors: Richard L. Clemmer, CEO and president As of December 31, 2010, our chief executive officer held 76,125 depositary receipts and had been granted the following stock options and performance stock units, which were outstanding.

These additional arrangements, such as expense compensation and relocation allowances, medical insurance, accident insurance, school fee compensation and company car arrangements are broadly in line with those for the NXP executives globally. In the event of disablement, our chief executive officer and other members of the management team are entitled to benefits in line with those for other NXP executives. In line with regulatory requirements, the Companys policy forbids personal loans, guarantees or similar arrangements to members of our board, and consequently no loans, guarantees or similar arrangements were granted to such members in 2009 or in 2010, nor were such loans outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Unless the law provides otherwise, the members of our board of directors are expected to be reimbursed by us for various costs and expenses, such as reasonable costs of defending claims, as formalized in the articles of association. Under certain circumstances, described in the articles of association, such as an act or failure to act by a member of our board of directors that can be characterized as intentional (opzettelijk), intentionally reckless (bewust roekeloos) or seriously culpable (ernstig verwijtbaar), there will be no entitlement to this reimbursement. 89 Summary Compensation Table The following table sets forth the annual compensation paid to the members of our board of directors on an individual basis for services in all capacities during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Board practices. Management Structure We have a one-tier board structure, consisting of an executive director and non-executive directors. Powers, Composition and Function The number of executive and non-executive directors is determined by the board of directors. The board of directors will consist of one executive director and ten non-executive directors. The executive director, Mr.Clemmer, has been appointed as our chief executive officer. The appointment of the directors will be made by our general meeting of stockholders upon a binding nomination of the board of directors. A resolution to appoint a director nominated by the board of directors shall be adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast. The board of directors shall make a list of candidates containing the names of at least the number of persons prescribed by law, which is currently two, for each vacancy to be filled. The nomination shall state whether the director is proposed to be an executive or non-executive director. The general meeting of stockholders may at all times overrule the binding nature of such a nomination by a resolution adopted by at least a two thirds majority of the votes cast, provided such majority represents more than half of our issued share capital. The board of directors may then make a new nomination, containing at least the number of persons prescribed by law, which currently is two. If a nomination has not been made or has not been made in due time, this shall be stated in the notice and the general meeting of stockholders shall be free to appoint a director at its discretion. The latter resolution of the general meeting of stockholders must also be adopted by at least two thirds majority of the votes cast, provided such majority represents more than half of our issued share capital. As the holder of more than 50% of our common stock, the Private Equity Consortium has the ability to elect our entire board, subject to any limitations in our shareholders agreement. 90 In addition, the Private Equity Consortium and Philips have entered into an amended and restated shareholders agreement that provides Philips with certain rights, including with respect to board representation, and requires the Private Equity Consortium to vote their shares in a manner that implements such rights. See Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsShareholders Agreement. Under our articles of association and Dutch corporate law, the members of the board of directors are collectively responsible for the management, general and financial affairs and policy and strategy of our company. Our executive director will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company and for the preparation and execution of board resolutions, to the extent these tasks are not delegated to a committee of the board of directors. Our chief executive officer or all directors acting jointly may represent our company with third parties. A conflict of interest between the Company and one or more of our directors is not expected to have any impact on the authority of directors to represent the Company. Under our board regulations, a conflict needs to be reported to the board of directors and the board of directors shall resolve on the consequences, if any. Under current Dutch law, in case of a conflict, the general meeting of stockholders may at any time resolve to designate a person to represent the Company. Although current Dutch law allows our directors to participate in deliberations and to vote on matters on which the respective director is conflicted, the Dutch corporate governance code and our board regulations do not allow directors to participate in discussions or vote on such matters. Our non-executive directors will supervise the executive director and our general affairs and provide general advice to the executive director. Furthermore the non-executive directors will perform such acts that are delegated to them pursuant to our articles of association or by our board regulation. One of the non-executive directors has been appointed as chairman of the board and another non-executive director has been appointed as vice-chairman of the board of directors. Each director owes a duty to us to properly perform the duties assigned to him and to act in the corporate interest of our company. Under Dutch law, the corporate interest extends to the interests of all corporate stakeholders, such as stockholders, creditors, employees, customers and suppliers. Our directors are appointed for one year and will be re-electable each year at the general meeting of stockholders. The members of our board of directors may be suspended or dismissed at any time by the general meeting of stockholders. A resolution to suspend or dismiss a director will have to be adopted by at least a two thirds majority of the votes cast, provided such majority represents more than half of our issued share capital and unless the proposal to suspend or dismiss a member of the board of directors is made by the board of directors itself, in which case resolutions shall be adopted by a simple majority of votes cast. Currently, Dutch law does not allow executive directors to be suspended by the board of directors; however, Dutch law is expected to be amended in mid 2011 to facilitate the suspension of executive directors by the board. In the event that one or more directors are prevented from acting or in the case of a vacancy or vacancies for one or more directors, the board of directors remains properly constituted. The board of directors is expected to have the power, without prejudice to its responsibility, to cause our company to be represented by one or more attorneys. These attorneys shall have such powers as shall be assigned to them on or after their appointment and in conformity with our articles of association, by the board of directors. The board of directors has adopted board regulations governing its performance, its decision making, its composition, the tasks and working procedure of the committees and other matters relating to the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the non-executive directors and the committees established by the board of directors. In accordance with our board regulations, resolutions of our board of directors will be adopted by a simple majority of votes cast in a meeting at which at least the majority of its members is present or represented. Each member of the board of directors has the right to cast one vote. In a tie vote, the proposal will be rejected. 91 Board Committees While retaining overall responsibility, our board of directors has assigned certain of its tasks to permanent committees. Members of the permanent committees will be appointed by the board of directors. The board of directors will also determine the tasks of each committee. Our board of directors has established an audit committee and a nominating and compensation committee, each of which will have the responsibilities and composition described below:  Audit Committee. Our audit committee consists of three independent non-executive directors, Messrs. Goldman, Kaeser and Sir Peter Bonfield. Mr. Goldman, who is appointed as chairman of the audit committee, will qualify as an audit committee financial expert as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and as determined by our board of directors. Our audit committee will assist the board of directors in supervising, monitoring and advising the board of directors on financial reporting, risk management, compliance with relevant legislation and regulations and our business code of conduct. It will oversee the preparation of our financial statements, our financial reporting process, our system of internal business controls and risk management, our internal and external audit process and our internal and external auditors qualifications, independence and performance. Our audit committee also will review our annual and interim financial statements and other public disclosures, prior to publication. At least once per year, the non-executive directors who are part of the audit committee will report their findings to the plenary board of directors. Our audit committee also recommends to our stockholders the appointment of external auditors. The external auditor will attend most meetings of the audit committee. The findings of the external auditor, the audit approach and the risk analysis are also discussed at these meetings.  Nominating and Compensation Committee. Our nominating and compensation committee consists of three non-executive directors, Messrs. Huth and Plantevin and Sir Peter Bonfield, who is also an independent director. Mr. Plantevin is appointed as chairman of this committee. The nominating & compensation committee will determine selection criteria and appointment procedures for members of our board of directors, to periodically assess the scope and composition of our board of directors and to evaluate the performance of its individual members. It will be responsible for recommending to the board of directors the compensation package for our executive directors, with due observance of the remuneration policy adopted by the general meeting of stockholders. It will review employment contracts entered into with our executive directors, make recommendations to our board of directors with respect to major employment-related policies and oversee compliance with our employment and compensation-related disclosure obligations under applicable laws. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification Matters Unless prohibited by law in a particular circumstance, our articles of association require us to reimburse the members of the board of directors and the former members of the board of directors for damages and various costs and expenses related to claims brought against them in connection with the exercise of their duties. However, there shall be no entitlement to reimbursement if and to the extent that (i) a Dutch court has established in a final and conclusive decision that the act or failure to act of the person concerned may be characterized as willful (opzettelijk), intentionally reckless (bewust roekeloos) or seriously culpable (ernstig verwijtbaar) conduct, unless Dutch law provides otherwise or this would, in view of the circumstances of the case, be unacceptable according to standards of reasonableness and fairness, or (ii) the costs or financial loss of the person concerned are covered by an insurance and the insurer has paid out the costs or financial loss. We may enter into indemnification agreements with the members of the board of directors and our officers to provide for further details on these matters. We expect to purchase directors and officers liability insurance for the members of the board of directors and certain other officers, substantially in line with that purchased by similarly situated companies. 92 At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any member of the board of directors, officer, employee or agent where indemnification will be required or permitted. We are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceedings that might result in a claim for such indemnification. Insofar as indemnification of liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to members of the board of directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and is therefore unenforceable. D. Employees.

B. Related party transactions. Private Equity Consortium, Philips and Philips Pension Trustees Advisory Services Agreements The members of the Private Equity Consortium will provide certain advisory services to us. We have entered into separate agreements in this regard with the respective parties, under which each of the various legal entities will receive an annual advisory fee of $25,000 (with an aggregate total amount of $125,000 annually). Shareholders Agreement Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering in August 2010, the members of the Private Equity Consortium restructured their indirect shareholding in our common stock such that each of them holds directly, or indirectly through a separate Luxembourg holding company, shares of our common stock. At the same time, KASLION Holding B.V. ceased to hold shares of our common stock. In connection with this restructuring, the members of the Private Equity Consortium, Philips and the Management Foundation (together, the Existing Shareholders) entered into a new shareholders agreement among themselves, which replaced the shareholders agreement entered into on September 29, 2006. We are not a party to the new shareholders agreement. Under the terms of the new shareholders agreement, the Existing Shareholders and any affiliate to which the Existing Shareholders transfer common stock are only allowed to sell shares of our common stock after having received approval from an investors committee consisting of representatives of the Private Equity Consortium. These restrictions will terminate upon the Existing Shareholders collectively ceasing to hold a percentage of shares of our common stock equal to at least (i) 25% of their shareholding immediately prior to the initial public offering and (ii) 10% (or, with respect to restrictions on sales by Philips, its affiliate transferees and transferees pursuant to clause (ii) of the following paragraph (collectively, the Philips Parties), 20%) of the shares of our common stock outstanding at any time, whichever occurs earlier. Any approved sale, other than sales by any Philips Party, will also be subject to pro rata tag-along rights for other Existing Shareholders. The transfer restrictions do not apply to (i) transfers of shares of our common stock by the Existing Shareholders to their respective affiliates, (ii) transfers of shares of our common stock held by Philips to affiliated entities or one or more pension funds operated for the benefit of Philips current and former employees, provided such persons enter into the new shareholders agreement, and (iii) transfers of shares in our common stock held by Philips Parties, provided that the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that can be sold by Philips Parties may not exceed (a) 4% of the Outstanding Share Amount during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date of the consummation of the relevant transfer or (b) 2% of the Outstanding Share Amount during the three-month period immediately preceding the date of the consummation of the relevant transfer. For purposes of these restrictions, Outstanding Share Amount shall mean (i) with respect to any transfer in respect of which a Form 144 has been filed with the SEC, the number of shares of common stock outstanding as shown on such form and (ii) with respect to any other transfer, that number of shares of common stock outstanding that we shall have most recently disclosed in our public filings with the SEC. Existing Shareholders proposing to sell at least 40% of the shares of our common stock outstanding at any time to a third party purchaser can also require the other Existing Shareholders to sell to such third party purchaser. The new shareholders agreement also contains voting agreements among the Existing Shareholders with respect to, among other matters, the election of certain non-executive members to our board of directors. The 97 shareholders agreement provides that our board of directors shall be comprised of, among others, seven non-executive members and that certain stockholders have the right to designate such non-executive members, subject to their election by our general meeting of stockholders. So long as Philips, or entities affiliated with Philips or operated for the benefit of Philips current and former employees, beneficially owns at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, Philips will have the right to designate one member to our board of directors. So long as any fund advised by KKR, Bain, Silver Lake, Apax or AlpInvest beneficially owns at least 2.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, such fund shall have the right to designate either one or two members to our board of directors. The funds advised by KKR and Bain each have the right to designate two members of our board of directors and the funds advised by Silver Lake and Apax each have the right to designate one member to our board of directors. If any partys shareholding falls below the relevant threshold, it will cause the board member(s) nominated by it to promptly resign from the board of directors, unless otherwise agreed. The new shareholders agreement will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including: (i) with respect to the individual parties to the agreement, upon such party ceasing to hold shares of common stock, (ii) with respect to Philips, upon the date that is three years after the consummation of the initial public offering in August 2010 and (iii) with respect to all parties, upon certain parties collective shareholdings falling below specified thresholds. Registration Rights Agreement In connection with the restructuring, the Existing Shareholders and certain other investors have entered into a registration rights agreement with us. In accordance with the registration rights agreement, we have agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC immediately following the first anniversary of the date of the initial public offering on August 5, 2010 for that purpose. In addition, the registration rights agreement provides the Existing Shareholders with an unlimited number of demand registration rights and with piggyback registration rights, with a right to participate for certain other investors, which, in either case if exercised, would impose on us an obligation to register for public resale with the SEC shares of our common stock that are held by the Existing Shareholders or such other investors. The demand registration rights can be exercised at any time after the expiration of the lockup period. The piggyback registration rights may be exercised whenever we propose to register any of our securities under the Securities Act or equivalent non-U.S. securities laws, other than the initial public offering on August 5, 2010 or a registration pursuant to demand registration rights, on Form F-4 or S-4 or any successor form or solely relating to an offering and sale to our employees or directors pursuant to any employee stock option plan or any other benefit plan arrangement. In each such event, we are required to pay the registration expenses. Philips, Philips Pension Trustees Limited and PPTL Investment LP On September 7, 2010, Philips Pension Trustees Limited purchased Philips 42,715,650 shares of common stock in the Company (Transfer Shares) in a private transaction. In a subsequent private transaction, on October 29, 2010, PPTL Investment LP purchased the Transfer Shares from Philips Pension Trustees Limited by way of a transfer agreement, to which also Philips is a party (Amended Transfer Agreement). PPTL Investment LP acquired the Transfer Shares for the purpose of owning and managing such assets as may be contributed to Philips Pension Trustees Limited. In connection with this transaction, PPTL Investment LP was required to join the new shareholders agreement, to which Philips and Philips Pension Trustees Limited were already a party. Under the terms of the new shareholders agreement, PPTL Investment LP is required to vote the Transfer Shares in favor of certain other parties nominees to the Companys board of directors. In addition, PPTL Investment LP may be required in the future to sell the Transfer Shares and to vote in favor of a sale of control of the Company pursuant to drag-along provisions contained in the new shareholders agreement, and may, if joining together with other parties thereto to form the percentage of common stock required to trigger such drag-along provisions, similarly require the other parties thereto to sell common stock and vote in favor of a sale of control of the Issuer. Philips may appoint the majority of the board of directors of Philips Pension Trustees Limited. In 98 addition, the Amended Transfer Agreement limits the ability of PPTL Investment LP as the holder of the Transfer Shares to dispose of the Transfer Shares without the consent of Philips. Furthermore, the shareholders agreement grants Philips the right to nominate one non-executive member of the Issuers board of directors and requires PPTL Investment LP to vote the Transfer Shares in favor of such nominee. Intellectual Property Transfer and License Agreement The Intellectual Property Transfer and License Agreement dated September 28, 2006, which we refer to as the IP Agreement, governs the licensing of certain intellectual property from Philips to us and from us to Philips. Under the terms of this agreement, Philips assigned to us approximately 5,300 patent families. The IP Agreement also provides for certain design and processing requirements with respect to a very limited number of patents, the so-called phase change memory patents, which provide that if we fail to exploit these patents within five years, we must reassign them to Philips. If we are required to re-assign patents, we will receive a non-transferable, royalty-free irrevocable license to use such patents following the re-assignment. In addition to assigning patents to us, Philips has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free and irrevocable license to all patents that Philips held but did not assign to us, to the extent that they were entitled to the benefit of a filing date prior to the separation between us and Philips and for which Philips was free to grant licenses to third parties without the consent of or accounting to any third party other than an entity owned or controlled by Philips or us and to certain know-how that was available to us, where such patents and know-how relate: (1) to our products and technologies, as of September 29, 2006, as well as successor products and technologies, (2) to technology that was developed for us prior to the separation between us and Philips, and (3) to technology developed pursuant to contract research work co-funded by us. Philips has also granted us a non exclusive, royalty free and irrevocable license (1) under certain patents for use in giant magneto-resistive devices outside the field of healthcare and bio applications, and (2) under certain patents relevant to polymer electronics resulting from contract research work cofounded by us in the field of radio frequency identification tags. This license is subject to exclusions. The license does not cover (1) patents which are necessary for the implementation of an adopted standard, (2) patents which as of September 29, 2006, were used or will be used by Philips in industry-wide licensing programs of which Philips has informed us in writing, (3) patents and know-how relating to 3D applications, or (4) unless originating from work co-funded by us or generated by our employees, patents for solid state lighting applications. The license is non-transferable (although divested companies will have an option, under certain circumstances, to enter into a new license agreement with Philips) but includes certain rights to grant sublicenses and to have products made by third party manufacturers (have-made rights). The license is subject to certain prior commitments and prior undertakings. In return, we granted Philips a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under all patents and know-how that Philips assigned and transferred to us under the IP Agreement. This license is non-transferable and includes specified sub-license and have-made rights. In particular Philips has been granted the right to have products made by third party manufacturers, solely for the account of, and use or resale by, Philips. Philips also has the right to grant sub-licenses for (a) integrated circuits and discretes, miniature loudspeakers, kits or RF front-end solutions and other products, (b) for features that are designed by or exclusively for Philips, (c) to third party manufacturers, that have obtained a right to make products for Philips for the duration of such manufacturer delivering such products to Philips, enabling such manufacturer to supply such products to third parties for the same applications as used by Philips after expiration of the lead times as agreed between Philips and the supplier. Philips is furthermore entitled to grant sub-licenses (1) to third parties insofar as necessary to enable primarily technology co-operations and to license software to third parties other than customers, (2) to third parties, with whom Philips or any of its associated companies has entered or will enter into cross-license agreements and to which we or any of our associated companies become a party and (3) insofar as necessary for the sale or licensing, directly or indirectly, of services, software and/or IP blocks by Philips. Philips has granted us a non-transferable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use any software retained by it within the scope of our business to the extent such software was available to us at the closing of our separation and to the extent necessary for the sale of existing products supplied by us at the time of 99 the separation. This license includes the right to modify and create derivative works and the right to grant sublicenses in the context of, and to the extent necessary for, the marketing or supplying certain products supplied by us on the date of the closing of our separation. In return, we have granted Philips a cross-license with respect to all software rights that Philips has assigned or transferred to us. Under the IP Agreement, Philips has also assigned to us certain copyrights, know-how, trademarks and domain names as well as certain patent license and patent ownership agreements. The copyrights assigned include all copyrights relating to integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors, miniature loudspeakers, kits and radio frequency front-end solutions that historically have been marketed by or developed by, or exclusively for, our business and any drawings and documentation relating to such products. The business know-how assigned includes know-how that originated within Philips but is used or intended to be used primarily within our business. The trademarks and domain names assigned include Nexperia® and TriMedia®. In accordance with the IP Agreement, we have ceased using the term Philips as a brand name or trade name without Philips consent. This includes the use of the Philips trademark and logo, and any derivative or combination mark. We are, however, permitted under certain circumstances to use the tag founded by Philips in accordance with Philips guidelines for a period of five years after our separation from Philips. Private Equity Consortium and Certain Co-investors We have been advised by the Private Equity Consortium that it has entered into an agreement relating to shares of our common stock with certain co-investors that participated with the Private Equity Consortium in connection with its purchase from Philips of 80.1% of its semiconductor business in 2006. Pursuant to this agreement, without the approval of an investors committee consisting of representatives of the Private Equity Consortium, the co-investors are generally prohibited from selling the shares of our common stock held by them as of the date of the initial public offering on August 5, 2010 for a period of first six months from the date we completed the initial public offering on August 5, 2010 and, thereafter, may only sell those shares in accordance with certain volume and other limitations. These volume and other limitations terminate 15 months after the initial public offering on August 5, 2010, after which time the co-investors may freely sell their shares without restriction under the agreement. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate number of shares our common stock beneficially owned by these co-investors was 12,337,577, representing approximately 4.9% of our outstanding shares. Other We have a number of strategic alliances and joint ventures. We have relationships with certain of our alliance partners in the ordinary course of business whereby we enter into various sale and purchase transactions, generally on terms comparable to transactions with third parties. The only material alliance partner with whom we have entered into transactions is Trident. C. Interests of experts and counsel. Not applicable. Item 8. Financial Information A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information. Consolidated Statements See Part IIIItem 18. Financial Statements. 100 Dividend Policy Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by the covenants of our Secured Revolving Credit Facility or the Forward Start Revolving Credit Facility, as the case may be, the Term Loan and the Indentures and may be limited by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities. As a result, we currently expect to retain future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of our debt, and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Whether or not dividends will be paid in the future will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors and our stockholders may deem relevant. If, in the future, our board of directors decides not to allocate profits to our reserves (making such profits available to be distributed as dividends), any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our stockholders. B. Significant Changes. No significant changes have occurred since the date of our consolidated financial statements. Item 9. The Offer and Listing. A. Offer and listing details.

E. Taxation. Certain tax considerationsholder of common stock For purposes of this section, all references herein to we, our and us are to NXP Semiconductors N.V. Summary of Dutch Tax Considerations The following summary describes the material Dutch tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our shares of common stock as of the date hereof and is intended as general information only. This summary 102 does not contain a detailed description of all the Dutch tax law consequences to you as a holder of shares of common stock in the Company in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the effects of any non-Dutch tax laws. For Dutch tax purposes, a holder of our shares may include an individual or entity who does not have the legal title of the shares, but to whom nevertheless the shares are attributed based either on such individual or entity holding a beneficial interest in the shares or based on specific statutory provisions, including statutory provisions pursuant to which shares are attributed to an individual who is, or who has directly or indirectly inherited from a person who was, the settlor, grantor or similar originator of a trust, foundation or similar entity that holds the shares. If you are considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of our shares, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the Dutch tax consequences to you in light of your particular situation as well as any consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. The following summary is based on the Dutch tax law as applied and interpreted by Dutch tax courts and as published and in effect on the date hereof, without prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect. For the purpose of this paragraph, Dutch taxes means taxes of whatever nature levied by or on behalf of the Netherlands or any of its subdivisions or taxing authorities and a resident of the Netherlands does not include residents of the islands of Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba. Any reference hereafter made to a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation concluded by the Netherlands, includes the Tax Regulation for the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Belastingregeling voor het Koninkrijk). Withholding Tax A stockholder is generally subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15 percent on dividends distributed by us. Generally, we are responsible for the withholding of such dividend withholding tax at source; the dividend withholding tax is for the account of the stockholder. Dividends distributed by us include, but are not limited to: (i) distributions of profits in cash or in kind, whatever they be named or in whatever form; (ii) proceeds from the liquidation of the Company, or proceeds from the repurchase of shares by the Company, in excess of the average paidin capital recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes; (iii) the par value of shares issued to a stockholder or an increase in the par value of shares, to the extent that no contribution, recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, has been made or will be made; and (iv) partial repayment of paidin capital, that is not recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, or recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, to the extent that we have net profits (zuivere winst) and unless (a) the general meeting of stockholders has resolved in advance to make such repayment, and (b) the par value of the shares concerned has been reduced with an equal amount by way of an amendment to our articles of association. Notwithstanding the above, no withholding is required in the event of a repurchase of shares, if certain conditions are fulfilled. Furthermore, subject to certain exceptions under Dutch domestic law, we may not be required to transfer to the Dutch tax authorities the full amount of Dutch dividend withholding tax withheld in respect of dividends distributed by us, if we have received a profit distribution from a qualifying foreign subsidiary (including a subsidiary resident on Aruba, Curaçao, St. Maarten, Bonaire, St. Eustatius or Saba), which distribution is exempt from Dutch corporate income tax and has been subject to a foreign withholding tax of at least 5 percent. The amount that does not have to be transferred to the Dutch tax authorities can generally not exceed the lesser of 103 (i) 3 percent of the dividends distributed by us and (ii) 3 percent of the profit distributions that we received from qualifying foreign subsidiaries in the calendar year in which we distribute the dividends (up to the moment of such dividend distribution) and in the two previous calendar years. Further limitations and conditions apply. We will, upon request, provide stockholders with information regarding the Dutch dividend withholding tax that was retained by us. If a stockholder is resident in a country other than the Netherlands under the provisions of a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation between the Netherlands and such country, such stockholder may, depending on the terms of such treaty, be entitled to an exemption from, reduction in or refund of Dutch dividend withholding tax on dividends distributed by us. If a stockholder is subject to Dutch corporate income tax and is entitled to the participation exemption in relation to the benefits derived from its shares and such shares are attributable to an enterprise carried out in the Netherlands, such stockholder will generally be entitled to an exemption from Dutch dividend withholding tax on dividends distributed by us. If a stockholder (i) is resident in another member state of the European Union or an appointed state of the European Economic Area, i.e. Iceland and Norway, according to the tax laws of that state and, under the terms of a double taxation agreement concluded by that state with a third state, is not considered to be resident for tax purposes outside the European Union, Norway or Iceland; and (ii) owns an interest in us to which the Dutch participation exemption would be applicable if the stockholder were resident in the Netherlands; such stockholder will generally be eligible for an exemption from Dutch dividend withholding tax on dividends distributed by us. Furthermore, if a stockholder: (a) is an entity which is resident for Dutch tax purposes in a member state of the European Union, Norway or Iceland; (b) is not subject to a tax levied by reference to profits by that member state; and (c) would not have been subject to Dutch corporate income tax had the stockholder been resident in the Netherlands for corporate income tax purposes; such stockholder will generally be eligible for a full refund of Dutch dividend withholding tax on dividends distributed by us, unless such stockholder carries out duties or activities similar to an exempt investment institution (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) or fiscal investment institution (fiscale beleggingsinstelling), as defined respectively in article 6a and 28 of the Dutch corporate income tax act (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969). A stockholder who is considered to be resident in the United States and is entitled to the benefits of the convention between the United States and the Netherlands for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, dated December 18, 1992, as amended most recently by the Protocol signed March 8, 2004 (the Treaty), will be entitled to a reduction in the Dutch withholding tax by way of an exemption, reduction or refund, as follows:  if the U.S. stockholder is an exempt pension trust, as described in article 35 of the Treaty, or an exempt organization, as described in article 36 of the Treaty, the U.S. stockholder will be exempt from Dutch dividend withholding tax;  if the U.S. stockholder is a company which holds directly at least 10 percent of the voting power in the company, the U.S. stockholder will be subject to Dutch withholding tax at a rate not exceeding 5 percent;  if the U.S. stockholder is a company which holds directly at least 80 percent of the voting power in the company and certain other conditions are met, the U.S. stockholder will be exempt from Dutch dividend withholding tax; and 104  in all other cases, the U.S. stockholder will be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate not exceeding 15 percent. According to Dutch domestic anti-dividend stripping rules, no credit against Dutch (corporate) income tax, exemption from, reduction in or refund of, Dutch dividend withholding tax will be granted if the recipient of the dividend paid by us is not considered to be the beneficial owner (uiteindelijk gerechtigde) of such dividends as meant in these rules. Taxes on Income and Capital Gains The description of taxation set out in this section of the prospectus does not apply to any stockholder who is an individual for whom the income or capital gains derived from our shares of common stock are attributable to employment activities, the income from which is taxable in the Netherlands. A stockholder will not be subject to Dutch taxes on income or capital gains in respect of the ownership and disposal of our shares, other than Dutch dividend withholding tax as described above, except if: (i) the stockholder is, or is deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands for Dutch (corporate) income tax purposes; (ii) the stockholder is an individual and the stockholder has opted to be treated as resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch income tax; (iii) the stockholder derives profits from an enterprise, whether as entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a coentitlement to the net worth of such enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or a stockholder, which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands, to which the shares are attributable; (iv) the stockholder is an individual and derives benefits from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden) carried out in the Netherlands in respect of the shares, including, without limitation, activities which are beyond the scope of active portfolio investment activities; (v) the stockholder is entitled, other than by way of the holding of securities, to a share in the profits of an enterprise effectively managed in the Netherlands to which the shares are attributable; or (vi) the stockholder has a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or a fictitious substantial interest (fictief aanmerkelijk belang) in the company, which is not attributable to the assets of an enterprise. Generally, a stockholder has a substantial interest if such stockholder, alone or together with its partner, directly or indirectly (a) owns, or holds certain rights on, shares representing five percent or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of the company, or of the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of the company; (b) holds rights to acquire shares, whether or not already issued, representing five percent or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of the company, or of the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of the company; or (c) owns, or holds certain rights on, profit participating certificates that relate to five percent or more of the annual profit of the company or to five percent or more of the liquidation proceeds of the company. A stockholder will also have a substantial interest if its partner or one of certain relatives of the stockholder or of its partner has a substantial interest. Generally, a stockholder has a fictitious substantial interest (fictief aanmerkelijk belang) in the company if, without having an actual substantial interest in the company (i) an enterprise has been contributed to the company in exchange for shares on an elective non-recognition basis; (ii) the shares have been obtained under inheritance law or matrimonial law, on a non-recognition basis, while the disposing stockholder had a substantial interest in the company; (iii) the shares have been acquired pursuant to a share merger, legal merger or legal demerger, on an elective non-recognition basis, while the stockholder prior to this transaction had a substantial interest in an entity that was party thereto; or (iv) the shares held by the stockholder, prior to dilution, qualified as a substantial interest and, by election, no gain was recognized upon disqualification of these shares. 105 Gift Tax and Inheritance Tax No Dutch gift or inheritance tax is due in respect of any gift of the shares by, or inheritance of the shares on the death of, a stockholder, except if: (i) at the time of the gift or death of the stockholder, the stockholder is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands; (ii) the stockholder passes away within 180 days after the date of the gift of the shares and is not, or not deemed to be, at the time of the gift, but is, or deemed to be, at the time of its death, resident in the Netherlands; or (iii) the gift of the shares is made under a condition precedent and the stockholder is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled. For purposes of Dutch gift or inheritance tax, an individual who is of Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or its death. For purposes of Dutch gift tax, any individual, irrespective of its nationality, will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the 12 months preceding the date of the gift. Other Taxes and Duties No other Dutch Taxes, including turnover tax and taxes of a documentary nature, such as capital tax, stamp or registration tax or duty, are payable by or on behalf of a stockholder by reason only of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the shares. Residency A stockholder will not become resident, or deemed resident in the Netherlands for tax purposes by reason only of holding the shares. United States Federal Income Tax Considerations The following summary describes the material United States federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our shares as of the date hereof. The discussion set forth below is applicable to United States Holders (as defined below) (i) who are residents of the United States for purposes of the Treaty, (ii) whose shares do not, for purposes of the Treaty, form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, or pertain to a fixed base, in the Netherlands, and (iii) who otherwise qualify for the full benefits of the Treaty. Except where noted, this summary deals only with shares held as capital assets. As used herein, the term United States Holder means a beneficial owner of a share that is for United States federal income tax purposes:  an individual citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. 106 This summary does not describe all of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are:  a dealer in securities or currencies;  a financial institution;  a regulated investment company;  a real estate investment trust;  an insurance company;  a tax-exempt organization;  a person holding our shares as part of a hedging, integrated or conversion transaction, a constructive sale or a straddle;  a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;  a person liable for alternative minimum tax;  a person who owns or is deemed to own 10% or more of our voting stock;  a person holding our shares in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United States;  a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes; or  a person whose functional currency is not the United States dollar. The discussion below is based upon the provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and regulations (including proposed regulations), rulings and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be replaced, revoked or modified so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. If a partnership holds our shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our shares, you should consult your tax advisors. This discussion does not contain a detailed description of all the United States federal income tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. If you are considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of our shares, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the United States federal income tax consequences to you in light of your particular situation as well as any consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. Taxation of Dividends The gross amount of distributions on the shares (including amounts withheld to reflect Dutch withholding taxes to the extent such amounts are actually transferred to the Dutch tax authorities, as described in Certain Tax ConsiderationsHolders of Common StockSummary of Dutch Tax ConsiderationsWithholding Tax) will be taxable as dividends to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Such income (including withheld taxes paid over to the Dutch tax authorities) will be includable in your gross income as ordinary income on the day actually received by you or on the day received by your nominee or agent that holds the shares on your behalf. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations under the Code. 107 With respect to non-corporate United States investors, certain dividends received in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013 from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A qualified foreign corporation includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States which the United States Treasury Department determines to be satisfactory for these purposes and which includes an exchange of information provision. The United States Treasury Department has determined that the Treaty meets these requirements. We believe we are currently eligible for the benefits of the Treaty. A foreign corporation is also treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid by that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. United States Treasury Department guidance indicates that our shares, which are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, are considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. There can be no assurance that our shares will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in later years. Non-corporate holders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which they are not protected from a risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to Section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. For this purpose, the minimum holding period requirement will not be met if a share has been held by a holder for 60 days or less during the 121-day period beginning on the date which is 60 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend, appropriately reduced by any period in which such holder is protected from risk of loss. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of this legislation to your particular circumstances. The maximum rate of withholding tax on dividends paid to you pursuant to the Treaty is 15 percent. You may be required to properly demonstrate to the Company and the Dutch tax authorities your entitlement to the reduced rate of withholding under the Treaty. Subject to certain conditions and limitations imposed by the United States federal income tax rules relating to the availability of the foreign tax credit, Dutch withholding taxes on dividends will be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against your United States federal income tax liability. However, amounts withheld to reflect Dutch withholding taxes will not be creditable to the extent that we are allowed to reduce the amount of the withholding tax that is actually transferred to the Dutch tax authorities, as described in Certain Tax ConsiderationsHolders of Common StockSummary of Dutch Tax ConsiderationsWithholding Tax. For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends paid on the shares will be treated as income from sources outside the United States and will generally constitute passive category income. Further, in certain circumstances, you will not be allowed a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed on dividends paid on the shares if you:  have held shares for less than a specified minimum period during which you are not protected from risk of loss, or  are obligated to make payments related to the dividends. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits for a taxable year, as determined under United States federal income tax principles, the distribution will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital, causing a reduction in the adjusted basis of the shares, and the balance in excess of adjusted basis will be taxed as capital gain recognized on a sale or exchange. However, we do not expect to keep earnings and profits in accordance with United States federal income tax principles. Therefore, you should expect that a distribution will generally be treated as a dividend (as discussed above). 108 Passive Foreign Investment Company Based on the composition of our income and valuation of our assets, including goodwill, we do not believe we were a passive foreign investment company (a PFIC) for the 2010 taxable year, and we do not expect to become one in the future, although there can be no assurance in this regard. In general, a foreign corporation will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which:  at least 75% of its gross income is passive income, or  at least 50% of the value (determined based on a quarterly average) of its assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties and rents (other than royalties and rents derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and not derived from a related person). If we own at least 25% (by value) of the stock of another corporation, we will be treated, for purposes of the PFIC tests, as owning our proportionate share of the other corporations assets and receiving our proportionate share of the other corporations income. The determination of whether we are a PFIC is made annually. Accordingly, it is possible that we may become a PFIC in the current or any future taxable year due to changes in our asset or income composition. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which you hold our shares, you will be subject to special tax rules discussed below. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which you hold our shares, you will be subject to special tax rules with respect to any excess distribution received and any gain realized from a sale or other disposition, including a pledge, of shares. Distributions received in a taxable year that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received during the shorter of the three preceding taxable years or your holding period for the shares will be treated as excess distributions. Under these special tax rules:  the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over your holding period for the shares,  the amount allocated to the current taxable year, and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC, will be treated as ordinary income, and  the amount allocated to each other year will be subject to tax at the highest applicable tax rate in effect for that year and the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the resulting tax attributable to each such year. In addition, non-corporate United States Holders will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividends received from us in taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2013 if we are a PFIC in our taxable year in which such dividends are paid or in the preceding taxable year. You will be required to file an annual report if you hold our shares in any year in which we are classified as a PFIC. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which you hold our shares and any of our non-United States subsidiaries is also a PFIC, a United States Holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC for purposes of the application of these rules. You are urged to consult your tax advisors about the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, in lieu of being subject to the excess distribution rules discussed above, you may make an election to include gain on the stock of a PFIC as ordinary income under a mark-to-market method, provided that such stock is regularly traded on a qualified exchange. Our shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which is a qualified exchange for purposes of the mark-to-market election. However, no assurance can be given that the shares will be regularly traded for purposes of the mark-to-market election. 109 If you make an effective mark-to-market election, you will include in each year that we are a PFIC as ordinary income the excess of the fair market value of your shares at the end of the year over your adjusted tax basis in the shares. You will be entitled to deduct as an ordinary loss in each such year the excess of your adjusted tax basis in the shares over their fair market value at the end of the year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. If you make an effective mark-to-market election, any gain you recognize upon the sale or other disposition of your shares in a year in which we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income. Any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election. Your adjusted tax basis in the shares will be increased by the amount of any income inclusion and decreased by the amount of any deductions under the mark-to-market rules. If you make a mark-to-market election, it will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless the shares are no longer regularly traded on a qualified exchange or the Internal Revenue Service consents to the revocation of the election. You are urged to consult your tax advisor about the availability of the mark-to-market election, and whether making the election would be advisable in your particular circumstances. Alternatively, holders of PFIC shares can sometimes avoid the rules described above by electing to treat such PFIC as a qualified electing fund under Section 1295 of the Code. However, this option is not available to you because we do not intend to comply with the requirements, or furnish you with the information, necessary to permit you to make this election. You are urged to consult your tax advisors concerning the United States federal income tax consequences of holding shares if we are considered a PFIC in any taxable year. Taxation of Capital Gains For United States federal income tax purposes, you will recognize taxable gain or loss on any sale or exchange of a share in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized for the share and your tax basis in the share. Subject to the discussion above under Passive Foreign Investment Company, such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of individuals derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss recognized by you will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding In general, information reporting will apply to dividends in respect of our shares and the proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of our shares that are paid to you within the United States (and in certain cases, outside the United States), unless you are an exempt recipient. Backup withholding may apply to such payments if you fail to provide a taxpayer identification number or certification of other exempt status or if you have previously failed to report in full dividend and interest income. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. Certain tax considerationsholder of notes For purposes of this section only, all references herein to the Issuer refer to NXP B.V. and all references to the notes herein refer to the notes issued by NXP B.V. 110 Summary of Dutch Tax Considerations The following is intended as general information only and it does not purport to present any comprehensive or complete description of all aspects of Dutch tax law which could be of relevance to a holder of notes (a Noteholder). For Dutch tax purposes, a Noteholder may include an individual or entity who does not have the legal title to the notes, but to whom nevertheless the notes are attributed based either on such individual or entity owning a beneficial interest in the notes or based on specific statutory provisions, including statutory provisions pursuant to which notes are attributed to an individual who is, or who has directly or indirectly inherited from a person who was, the settlor, grantor or similar originator of a trust, foundation or similar entity that holds the notes. Prospective Noteholders should therefore consult their tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of any purchase, ownership or disposal of notes. The following summary is based on the Dutch tax law as applied and interpreted by Dutch tax courts and as published and in effect on the date hereof, without prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect. For the purpose of this paragraph, Dutch Taxes shall mean taxes of whatever nature levied by the Netherlands or any of its subdivisions or taxing authorities and a resident of the Netherlands shall not include residents of the islands of Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba. Withholding Tax Any payments made under the notes will not be subject to withholding or deduction for any Dutch Taxes. Taxes on Income and Capital Gains This section does not purport to describe the possible Dutch tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant to a Noteholder who has a (fictitious) substantial interest in the Issuer, or to Noteholders that are individuals for whom the income and capital gains derived from the Notes are attributable to employment activities the income from which is taxable in the Netherlands. Generally, a Noteholder has a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) if such Noteholder, alone or together with his partner, directly or indirectly: (i) owns, or holds certain rights on, shares representing five percent or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of the Issuer, or of the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of the Issuer; (ii) holds rights to acquire shares, whether or not already issued, representing five percent or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of the Issuer, or of the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of the Issuer; or (iii) owns, or holds certain rights on, profit participating certificates that relate to five percent or more of the annual profit of the Issuer or to five percent or more of the liquidation proceeds of the Issuer. A Noteholder who owns shares of the Issuer will also have a substantial interest if his partner or one of certain relatives of the Noteholder or of his partner has a substantial interest. Generally, a Noteholder has a fictitious substantial interest (fictief aanmerkelijk belang) if, without having an actual substantial interest in the Issuer: (i) an enterprise has been contributed to the Issuer in exchange for shares on an elective non-recognition basis; 111 (ii) the shares have been obtained under gift law, inheritance law or matrimonial law, on a non-recognition basis, while the disposing Noteholder had a substantial interest in the Issuer; (iii) the shares have been acquired pursuant to a share merger, legal merger or legal demerger, on an elective non-recognition basis, while the Noteholder prior to this transaction had a substantial interest in an entity that was party thereto; or (iv) the shares held by the Noteholder, prior to dilution, qualified as a substantial interest and, by election, no gain was recognized upon disqualification of these shares. Residents in the Netherlands The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following Noteholders: (i) individuals who are resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands; (ii) individuals who opt to be treated as if resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation ((i) and (ii) jointly Dutch Individuals); and (iii) entities that are subject to the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (CITA) and are resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for the purposes of the CITA, excluding:  pension funds (pensioenfondsen) and other entities, that are, in whole or in part, exempt from Dutch corporate income tax; and  Investment institutions (beleggingsinstellingen); (Dutch Corporate Entities). Dutch Individuals not engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise or in miscellaneous activities Generally, a Dutch Individual who holds notes (i) that are not attributable to an enterprise from which he derives profits as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder, or (ii) from which he derives benefits which are not taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities (overige werkzaamheden), which include the performance of activities with respect to the notes that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal actief vermogensbeheer), will be subject annually to an income tax imposed on a fictitious yield on such notes. The notes held by such Dutch Individual will be taxed under the regime for savings and investments (inkomen uit sparen en beleggen). Irrespective of the actual income or capital gains realized, the annual taxable benefit of all the assets and liabilities of a Dutch Individual that are taxed under this regime, including the notes, is set at a fixed amount. The fixed amount equals 4 percent of the fair market value of these assets and liabilities measured, in general, exclusively at the beginning of every calendar year. The current tax rate under the regime for savings and investments is a flat rate of 30 percent. Dutch Individuals engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise or in miscellaneous activities Dutch Individuals are generally subject to income tax at progressive rates with a maximum of 52 percent with respect to any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from notes (including any capital gains realized on the disposal thereof) that are either attributable to an enterprise from which a Dutch Individual derives profits, whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder), or attributable to miscellaneous activities (overige werkzaamheden), which include the performance of activities with respect to the notes that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal actief vermogensbeheer). Dutch Corporate Entities Dutch Corporate Entities are generally subject to corporate income tax at statutory rates up to 25 percent with respect to any benefits derived or deemed to be derived (including any capital gains realized on the disposal thereof) of notes. A reduced rate of 20% applies to the first EUR 200,000 of taxable profits. 112 Non-Residents A Noteholder other than a Dutch Individual or Dutch Corporate Entity will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains in respect of the ownership and disposal of the notes, except if: (i) the Noteholder derives profits from an enterprise, whether as entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder, which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands, to which notes are attributable; or (ii) the Noteholder is an individual and derives benefits from miscellaneous activities (overige werkzaamheden), which include the performance of activities with respect to the notes that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal actief vermogensbeheer), performed in the Netherlands in respect of notes, including, without limitation, activities which are beyond the scope of active portfolio investment activities; or (iii) the Noteholder is entitled to a share in the profits or is entitled to the net worth of an enterprise effectively managed in the Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities or in case of an individual, through an employment contract, to which enterprise the notes are attributable. Gift Tax or Inheritance Tax No Dutch gift or inheritance tax is due in respect of any gift of the notes by, or inheritance of the notes on the death of, a Noteholder, except if (i) at the time of the gift or death of the Noteholder, the Noteholder is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands; (ii) the Noteholder passes away within 180 days after the date of the gift of the notes and is not, or not deemed to be, at the time of the gift, but is, or deemed to be, at the time of his death, resident in the Netherlands; (iii) the gift of the notes is made under a condition precedent and the Noteholder is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled. For purposes of Dutch gift or inheritance tax, an individual who is of Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his death. For purposes of Dutch gift tax, any individual, irrespective of his nationality, will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the 12 months preceding the date of the gift. Other Taxes and Duties No other Dutch Taxes, including turnover tax and taxes of a documentary nature, such as capital tax, stamp or registration tax or duty, are payable by or on behalf of a Noteholder by reason only of the issue, acquisition or transfer of the notes. Residency Subject to the exceptions above, a Noteholder will not become resident, or a deemed resident, in the Netherlands for tax purposes solely by reason of the Noteholders acquisition, holding and/or disposal of the notes. EC Council Directive Based on Directive 2003/48/EC (the EC Savings Directive), the tax authorities of the EU Member States provide each other with details of payments of interest and similar income made to individuals who are the 113 beneficial owner of those payments, but permits Austria and Luxembourg instead to impose a withholding tax on the payments concerned for a transitional period (i.e. 20% until June 30, 2011, and 35% from July 1, 2011 onwards). We will not pay any additional amounts if withholding tax is imposed pursuant to the EC Savings Directive. The EC Savings Directive also provides that no such withholding tax should be levied where the beneficial owner of the payment authorizes an exchange of information and/or where the beneficial owner presents a certificate from the tax authority of the EU Member State in which the beneficial owner is resident. A number of non-EU countries and certain dependent or associated territories, including Switzerland, have agreed to adopt similar measures (in certain cases on a reciprocal basis). The EC Savings Directive does not preclude EU Member States from levying other types of withholding tax. On April 24, 2009, the European Parliament approved an amended version of certain changes proposed by the European Commission to these provisions, which would, if implemented, cause them to apply in a wider range of circumstances. United States Federal Income Tax Considerations The following discussion is a summary of the material United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes as of the date hereof. Except where noted, this summary deals only with notes that are held as capital assets by a U.S. holder. As used herein, a U.S. holder means a beneficial owner of notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes any of the following:  an individual citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxes and does not deal with foreign, state, or local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to holders in light of their personal circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address:  tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, certain financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;  tax consequences to persons holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle;  tax consequences to holders of the notes whose functional currency is not the United States dollar; or  alternative minimum tax consequences, if any. 114 If a partnership holds notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our notes, you should consult your tax advisor. If you purchase or have purchased notes at a price other than the initial offering price, which for this purpose will equal the first price to the public (not including bond houses, brokers or similar person or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money, the rules regarding the taxation of amortizable bond premium or market discount may also apply to you. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this possibility. You should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the ownership of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. Payments of Interest Interest on a note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes. If you are a taxpayer that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes and you receive an interest payment that is denominated in, or determined by reference to, euro, you must recognize income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether you actually convert the payment into U.S. dollars. If you are a taxpayer that uses an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income that you recognize with respect to an interest payment denominated in, or determined by reference to, euro by using one of two methods. Under the first method, you will determine the amount of income accrued based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, that part of the period within the taxable year. If you elect the second method, you would determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period, or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year. Additionally, under this second method, if you receive a payment of interest within five business days of the last day of your accrual period or taxable year, you may instead translate the interest accrued into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day that you actually receive the interest payment. If you elect the second method it will apply to all debt instruments that you hold at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies and to all debt instruments that you subsequently acquire. You may not revoke this election without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service. When you actually receive an interest payment, including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or retirement of your note, denominated in, or determined by reference to, euro for which you accrued an amount of income, you will recognize ordinary income or loss measured by the difference, if any, between the exchange rate that you used to accrue interest income and the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether you actually convert the payment into U.S. dollars. Although interest payments on the notes are currently exempt from Dutch taxation, if there is a change in law requiring any Dutch tax to be withheld from interest payments, you will be required to include in income any such tax and any additional amounts in respect thereof. You may be entitled to deduct or credit this tax, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any Dutch taxes withheld and any additional amounts in respect thereof) on a note generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. 115 Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Disposition of Notes Your tax basis in a note will, in general, be your U.S. dollar cost for that note. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount you realize upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and your adjusted tax basis of the note. Except as discussed below, such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. Capital gains of individuals derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you purchase your note with euro, the U.S. dollar cost of your note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase. However, if you are a cash basis taxpayer, or an electing accrual basis taxpayer, and your note is traded on an established securities market, as defined in the applicable Treasury regulations, the U.S. dollar cost of your note will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the settlement date of your purchase. If your note is sold, exchanged or retired for an amount in euro, the amount you realize will be the U.S. dollar value of such amount on the date the note is sold, exchanged or retired, except that in the case of a note that is traded on an established securities market, as defined in the applicable Treasury regulations, a cash basis taxpayer, or an electing accrual basis taxpayer, will determine the amount realized based on the U.S. dollar value of the euro on the settlement date of the sale. You must treat any portion of the gain or loss that you recognize on the sale, exchange or retirement of a note as ordinary income or loss to the extent attributable to changes in U.S. dollar/euro exchange rates. The amount of exchange gain or loss will be limited to the overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. Exchange Gain or Loss with Respect to Euro If you receive euro as interest on your note or on the sale or retirement of your note, your tax basis in the euro will equal its U.S. dollar value when the interest is received or at the time of the sale or retirement. If you purchase euro, you generally will have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro on the date of your purchase. If you sell or dispose of euro, including if you use it to purchase notes or exchange it for U.S. dollars, any gain or loss recognized generally will be ordinary income or loss. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting Generally, information reporting requirements may apply to payments of principal and interest on a note and the proceeds from a sale of a note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient. Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments, have previously failed either to report in full dividend and interest income or fail to make certain certifications, you may be subject to backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through fixed and variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies. Changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. By using derivative instruments, we are subject to credit and market risk. The fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves, as well as foreign exchange and commodity spot and forward rates, and reflects the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting period. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, thus creating a receivable risk for us. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. We minimize counterparty credit (or repayment) risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. Our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow. Interest Rate Risk Given the leveraged nature of our Company, we have inherent exposure to changes in interest rates. Our Secured Revolving Credit Facility has a floating rate interest and so will our Forward Start Revolving Credit Facility. From time to time, we may execute a variety of interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. Consistent with our risk management objective and strategy, we have no interest rate risk hedging transactions in place. NXP has issued several series of notes with maturities ranging from 4 to 9 years and a mix of floating and fixed rates. The euro and U.S. dollar denominated notes represent 29% and 71% respectively of the total notes outstanding. 117 The following table summarizes the outstanding notes per December 31, 2010: Principalamount* Fixed/floating Current couponrate Maturity date Senior Priority Notes  29 Fixed 10.0 % 2013 Senior Priority Notes $ 221 Fixed 10.0 % 2013 Senior Secured Notes  637 Floating 3.74 % 2013 Senior Secured Notes $ 766 Floating 3.04 % 2013 Senior Secured Notes $ 362 Fixed 7.875 % 2014 Senior Notes  235 Fixed 8.625 % 2015 Senior Notes $ 606 Fixed 9.5 % 2015 Senior Secured Notes $ 1,000 Fixed 9.75 % 2018 * amount in millions A sensitivity analysis in relation to our long-term debt shows that if interest rates were to increase/decrease instantaneously by 1% from the level of December 31, 2010, all other variables held constant, the annualized interest expense would increase/decrease by $16 million. This impact is based on the outstanding net debt position as of December 31, 2010. We intend to draw on our new Term Loan on April 6, 2011 and use the proceeds together with cash on hand and the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, to retire all $362 million of outstanding 2014 Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, together with $100 million of Dollar Floating Rate Secured Notes, 143 million of Euro Floating Rate Secured Notes. Our Term Loan has a principal amount of $500 million, matures on March 4, 2017, and bears interest at a floating rate of 3.25% above LIBOR, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.25%. Foreign Currency Risks We are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could affect operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows. We monitor our exposures to these market risks and generally employ operating and financing activities to offset these exposures where appropriate. If we do not have operating or financing activities to sufficiently offset these exposures, from time to time, we may employ derivative financial instruments such as swaps, collars, forwards, options or other instruments to limit the volatility to earnings and cash flows generated by these exposures. Derivative financial instruments are only used for hedging purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes. The Company measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values derived from market prices of the instruments or from option pricing models, as appropriate and record these as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair values are recognized in the statement of operations immediately unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied. Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. However, our foreign currency exposures also relate, but are not limited, to the Chinese Yuan, the Japanese Yen, the Pound Sterling, the Malaysian Ringit, the Singapore Dollar, the Taiwan Dollar and the Thailand Baht. It is our policy that transaction exposures are hedged. Accordingly, our organizations identify and measure their exposures from transactions denominated in other than their own functional currency. We calculate our net exposure on a cash flow basis considering balance sheet items, actual orders received or made and anticipated revenues and expenses.

Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds. None Item 15. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and included controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Prior Period We are a newly listed public company and, as such, for the year ended December 31, 2010, we are not yet required to perform an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting. However, as we are a holding company whose only material assets are the direct ownership of 100% of the shares of NXP B.V., which has been an SEC registrant for a number of years, and has been required to assess and report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, we therefore decided to include the outcome of such assessment for the year ended December 31, 2010. In connection with our assessment of the internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2009, NXP B.V. identified and reported a material weakness related to the accounting and disclosure for income taxes, specifically relating to the execution of the procedures surrounding the preparation and review of our income tax provision. The execution of our controls did not ensure the accuracy and validity of our acquisition accounting adjustments and the determination of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Part of the identified issue was caused by the complexity that resulted from the fact that step-ups from acquisitions are accounted for centrally. We have implemented controls designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness described above. The following steps were taken:  We analyzed and improved our tax accounting process including the design and execution of our controls, involving our own staff as well as external subject matter experts;  We implemented structural measures to improve the knowledge and expertise in the field of tax accounting;  We hired a senior tax accountant to help ensure that tax accounting takes place in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  We rolled out tax accounting training sessions throughout the year 2010. 120 Based on our evaluation of these enhanced controls and increased staffing levels, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, we have remediated the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we identified as of December 31, 2009. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance, regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as at December 31, 2010. It should be noted that any control system, regardless of how well it is designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Control systems can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. In addition, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm This annual report does not include an attestation report regarding internal control over financial reporting of the Companys registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly listed public companies. Item 16A. Audit committee financial expert. Mr. Goldman, chairman of our audit committee, qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and as determined by our board of directors. Item 16B. Code of Ethics. The NXP business code of conduct outlines our general commitment to be a responsible social partner and the way in which we attempt to interact with our stakeholders, including stockholders, suppliers, customers, employees and the market. The business code of conduct expresses our commitment to an economically, socially and ethically sustainable way of working. It covers our policy on a diverse array of subjects, including corporate gifts, child labor, ILO conventions, working hours, sexual harassment, free-market competition, bribery and the integrity of financial reporting. We have also adopted a Financial Code of Ethics applicable to certain of our senior employees, which constitutes a code of ethics as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both the NXP Business Code of Conduct and our Financial Code of Ethics are available on our website at www.nxp.com/investor/governance. The information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website neither constitutes part of this annual report on form 20-F nor is incorporated by reference herein. 121 Item 16C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services. The Company has instituted a comprehensive auditor independence policy that regulates the relation between the Company and its external auditors and is available on our website (www.nxp.com/investor/governance). The policy includes rules for the pre-approval by the audit committee of all services to be provided by the external auditor. The policy also describes the prohibited services that may never be provided. Proposed services may be pre-approved at the beginning of the year by the audit committee (annual pre-approval) or may be pre-approved during the year by the audit committee in respect of a particular engagement (specific pre-approval). The annual pre-approval is based on a detailed, itemized list of services to be provided, designed to ensure that there is no management discretion in determining whether a service has been approved and to ensure the audit committee is informed of each service it is pre-approving. Unless pre-approval with respect to a specific service has been given at the beginning of the year, each proposed service requires specific pre-approval during the year. Any annually pre-approved services where the fee for the engagement is expected to exceed pre-approved cost levels or budgeted amounts will also require specific pre-approval. The term of any annual pre-approval is 12 months from the date of the pre-approval unless the audit committee states otherwise. During 2010, there were no services provided to the Company by the external auditors which were not pre-approved by the audit committee. The external auditor attends, in principle, all meetings of the audit committee. The findings of the external auditor, the audit approach and the risk analysis are also discussed at these meetings. The external auditor attends the meeting of the board of directors at which the report of the external auditor with respect to the audit of the annual accounts is discussed, and at which the annual accounts are approved. In its audit report on the annual accounts to the board of directors, the external auditor refers to the financial reporting risks and issues that were identified during the audit, internal control matters, and any other matters, as appropriate, requiring communication under the auditing standards generally accepted in the Netherlands and the United States. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, included in this annual report, have been audited by KPMG Accountants N.V., an independent registered public accounting firm. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2008, included in this annual report, has been audited by Deloitte Accountants B.V., an independent registered public accounting firm. All of these financial statements have been approved by the relevant boards. The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for the fiscal periods 2008 until 2010 were as follows: Aggregate fees KPMG 2008 2009 2010 ($ in millions) Audit fees  2.0 3.7 Audit-related fees  2.2 1.9 Tax fees  0.1 0.1 Other fees     4.3 5.7 122 Aggregate fees Deloitte 2008 2009 2010 ($ in millions) Audit fees 4.2 1.2  Audit-related fees 0.7 0.1  Tax fees 0.7   Other fees 0.2   5.8 1.3  Audit fees consist of fees for the examination of both the consolidated and statutory financial statements and, in 2007, audit fees related to the start-up of NXP as a new company, separated from Philips. Audit-related fees consist of fees in connection with audits of acquisitions and divestments. Tax fees consist of fees for professional services in relation to tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. Item 16D. Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committees. Not applicable. Item 16E. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers. Not applicable. Item 16F. Change in Registrants Certifying Accountant. Not applicable. Item 16G. Corporate Governance. The Dutch Corporate Governance Code Since our initial public offering in August 2010, we have been required to comply with the Dutch corporate governance code. The Dutch corporate governance code, as revised, became effective on January 1, 2009, and applies to all Dutch companies listed on a government-recognized stock exchange, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere. The code is based on a comply or explain principle. Accordingly, companies are required to disclose in their annual reports filed in the Netherlands whether or not they are complying with the various rules of the Dutch corporate governance code that are addressed to the board of directors or, if any, the supervisory board of the company and, if they do not apply those provisions, to give the reasons for such non-application. The code contains principles and best practice provisions for managing boards, supervisory boards, stockholders and general meetings of stockholders, financial reporting, auditors, disclosure, compliance and enforcement standards. We expect to take various actions towards compliance with the provisions of the Dutch corporate governance code. The Dutch corporate governance code provides that if a company indicates to what extent it applies the best practice provisions, such company will deemed to have applied the Dutch corporate governance code. The following discussion summarizes the primary differences between our corporate governance structure and best practice provisions of the Dutch corporate governance code:  Best practice provisions II.2.4 and II.2.5 state that stock options granted to members of our board shall, in any event, not be exercised in the first three years after the date of granting and shares granted to 123 board members without financial consideration shall be retained for a period of at least five years or until at least the end of the employment, if this period is shorter. Under our equity incentive schemes, part of the stock options granted to our chief executive officer in November 2010 are exercisable one year after the date of grant, and members of our board who received restrictive shares and performance shares in November 2010 are not required to retain these shares for at least five years. Although a deviation from the Corporate Governance Code, we hold the view that the combination of equity incentives granted to our chief executive officer, in relation to his obligation to invest in the Company and the applicable strict vesting and performance criteria, as well as the limited exercise possibility for pre-IPO MEP stock options granted to him, will enhance the goal of promoting long-term investments in the Company. The same is true for the equity grants made to other members of our board, which also have very strict vesting criteria with the purpose of creating long-term commitment to the Company.  Best practice provision III.8.4 states that the majority of the members of the board shall be independent. In our board of directors, three non-executive members are independent. It is our view that given the nature of our business and the practice in our industry and considering our stockholder structure, it is justified that only three non-executive directors are independent.  Pursuant to best practice provision IV.1.1, a general meeting of stockholders is empowered to cancel binding nominations of candidates for the board, and to dismiss members of the board by a simple majority of votes of those in attendance, although the company may require a quorum of at least one third of the voting rights outstanding. If such quorum is not represented, but a majority of those in attendance vote in favor of the proposal, a second meeting may be convened and its vote will be binding, even without a one-third quorum. Our articles of association currently state that the general meeting of stockholders may at all times overrule a binding nomination by a resolution adopted by at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, if such majority represents more than half of the issued share capital. Although a deviation from provision IV.1.1 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, we hold the view that these provisions will enhance the continuity of the Companys management and policies. Although Dutch law currently allows for directors to vote on matters with regard to which they have an interest, this is expected to change in the near future. The Dutch corporate governance code, as well as our board rules, does not allow directors to vote on a matter with regard to which they have an interest. The NASDAQ Global Select Market Corporate Governance Rules NASDAQ rules provide that NASDAQ may provide exemptions from its corporate governance standards to a foreign issuer when those standards are contrary to a law, rule or regulation of any public authority exercising jurisdiction over such issuer or contrary to generally accepted business practices in the issuers country of domicile. We are exempt from certain NASDAQ corporate governance standards that are contrary to the laws, rules, regulations or generally accepted business practices of the Netherlands. These exemptions and the practices followed by our company are described below:  We are exempt from NASDAQs quorum requirements applicable to meetings of stockholders. Pursuant to Dutch corporate law, the validity of a resolution by the general meeting of stockholders does not depend on the proportion of the capital or stockholders represented at the meeting (i.e. quorum), unless the law or articles of association of a company provide otherwise. Our articles of association provide that a resolution proposed to the general meeting of stockholders by the board of directors shall be adopted by a simple majority of votes cast, unless an other majority of votes or quorum is required under Dutch law or our articles of association. All other resolutions shall be adopted by a two thirds majority of the votes cast, provided such majority represents at least half of the issued share capital, unless an other majority of votes or quorum is required under Dutch law. To this extent, our practice varies from the requirement of Listing Rule 5620(c), which requires an issuer to provide in its bylaws for a quorum, and that such quorum may not be less than one-third of the outstanding voting stock. 124  We are exempt from NASDAQs requirements regarding the solicitation of proxies and provision of proxy statements for meetings of stockholders. We inform stockholders of meetings in a public notice. We prepare a proxy statement and solicit proxies from the holders of our listed stock. Our practice in this regard, however, differs from the typical practice of U.S. corporate issuers in that the advance record date for determining the holders of record entitled to attend and vote at our stockholder meetings is determined by Dutch law (currently 28 days prior to the meeting). As an administrative necessity, we establish a mailing record date in advance of each meeting of stockholders for purposes of determining the stockholders to which the proxy statement and form of proxy will be sent. However, only stockholders of record on the specified record date are entitled to attend and vote, directly or by proxy, at the meeting.  NASDAQ requires stockholder approval prior to the issuance of securities when a stock option or purchase plan is to be established or materially amended or other equity compensation arrangement made or materially amended, pursuant to which stock may be acquired by officers, directors, employees or consultants. Under Dutch law and the Dutch corporate governance code, stockholder approval is only required for equity compensation plans (or changes thereto) for members of the board, and not for equity compensation plans for other groups of employees. However, we note that under Dutch law, the stockholders have the power to issue shares or rights to subscribe for shares at the general meeting of the stockholders unless such power has been delegated to the board. Our board is designated for a period of five years from the date of the public offering in August 2010 to issue shares and rights to subscribe for shares.  NASDAQ requires the majority of the board of directors to be comprised of independent directors. Although the Dutch corporate governance code provides that the majority of the members of the board be independent, it also provides that if a company expressly indicates the reasons and the extent to which it does not apply the provisions of the Dutch corporate governance code, such company will deemed to have applied the code. As described under Corporate GovernanceThe Dutch Corporate Governance Code above, three to four non-executive members of our board of directors will be independent. It is our view that given the nature of our business and the practice in our industry and considering our stockholder structure, it is justified that only three to four non-executive directors will be independent.  We are exempt from NASDAQs requirement to have independent director oversight of executive officer compensation. Under Dutch law and the Dutch corporate governance code, the general meeting of stockholders must adopt a policy in respect of the remuneration of the board. In accordance with our articles of association and our board rules, the remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the board of directors upon the recommendation of our nominating and compensation committee.  We are exempt from NASDAQs requirement to have independent director oversight of director nominations. In accordance with Dutch law, our articles of association require that our directors will be appointed by the general meeting of stockholders upon the binding nomination of the board. In accordance with our board rules, the nominating and compensation committee will recommend the nomination of directors to our board.  NASDAQ requires us to adopt a nominations committee charter or a board resolution addressing the nominations process. In accordance with the Dutch corporate governance code, we have adopted the committees charter. However, the nominations process has been set out in our articles of association and board rules. Moreover, we will not distribute annual reports to all of our stockholders in accordance with NASDAQ rules. Dutch law requires that the external auditors be appointed at the general meeting of stockholders and not by the audit committee. Our audit committee, which consists of members of our board of directors, shall only make a recommendation to the stockholders through the board of directors for the appointment and compensation of the independent registered public accounting firm and shall oversee and evaluate the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. 125 PART III Item 17.

All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated 1 Introduction The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NXP Semiconductors N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including NXP B.V. NXP Semiconductors N.V. (the Company or NXP) is a holding company, whose only material assets are the direct ownership of 100% of the shares of NXP B.V., which provides leading High-Performance Mixed-Signal and Standard Products solutions that leverages application insight and technology and manufacturing expertise in radio frequency, analog, power management, interface, security and digital processing products. NXPs product solutions are used in a wide range of automotive, identification, wireless infrastructure, lighting, industrial, mobile, consumer and computing applications. The Company headquarters are in the Netherlands. In its current form, NXP was established on September 29, 2006, when Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. (Philips) sold 80.1% of its semiconductor business (with over 50 years of innovation and operating history) to a consortium of private equity investors (the Private Equity Consortium) in a multi-step transaction. In order to carry out this transaction, Philips transferred 100% of its semiconductor business to a separate legal entity, being NXP B.V., on September 28, 2006. Subsequently, on September 29, 2006, all of the issued and outstanding shares of NXP B.V. were then acquired by the Company. We refer to this multi-step transaction as the Formation. At the time of the Formation, the Company was called KASLION Acquisition B.V., a Dutch private company with limited liability. On May 21, 2010, the Company converted into a public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap) and changed its name to NXP Semiconductors N.V. In August 2010, the Company completed its initial public offering and since then has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol NXPI. Reverse stock split In connection with the IPO, the Company amended its Articles of Association on August 2, 2010 in order to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its shares of common stock. As a consequence, the number of shares outstanding has been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the reverse stock-split in all periods presented. Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the reverse stock split in all periods presented. Also, the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable under the Companys share based compensation plans were proportionately adjusted retrospectively to reflect the reverse stock split. In addition, authorized and issued share capital has been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the reverse stock split. The effect of the 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our shares of common stock is reflected in the table below: Before stock split After stock split December 31,2009 December 31,2009 December 31,2010 Number of common shares outstanding before issuance of new shares 4,305,030,000 215,251,500 215,251,500 Issuance of new shares from IPO   34,000,000 Issuance of new shares for equity incentive plan   1,500,000 Number of common shares outstanding at the end of the period 4,305,030,000 215,251,500 250,751,500 Conversion In addition to the reverse stock split, the Company has also amended its Articles of Association in order to convert a certain percentage of previously authorized common stock to preferred stock. Including the shares F-10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated issued upon the public offering in August 2010 and the shares of common stock issued in view of a new equity incentive plan in November 2010, the final result is that the stock capital of the Company as of December 31, 2010 consists of 1,076,257,500 authorized shares, including 430,503,000 authorized shares of common stock (of which 250,751,500 are issued), as well as 645,754,500 authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. Accounting policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP). Historical cost is used as the measurement basis unless otherwise indicated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reporting currency Effective January 1, 2008, the Company changed its reporting currency from Euro to U.S. dollars in order to better align with the rest of the semiconductor market and to permit easier comparison with the financial results of its peers. The financial statements have been restated for all periods prior to 2008 to reflect the change in reporting currency on a consistent basis. For restating the historical financial statements from euro to U.S. dollars, the Company has applied the process described in the accounting policies. The functional currency of the Company and the various entities within the NXP Group were not changed as a result of the change in reporting currency. Segment reporting In compliance with FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting, as from January 1, 2010 four segments are distinguished as business segments. The Company is structured in two market-oriented business segments: High-Performance Mixed-Signal and Standard Products, which each represent a reportable operating segment. The two other reportable segments are Manufacturing Operations and Corporate and Other. Adjustments to previously reported financial statements Amounts previously reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 have been adjusted to correct immaterial errors in the application of functional currency to certain intangible assets and goodwill recorded in conjunction with certain business combinations. These adjustments affecting the consolidated balance sheet are set out in the table hereafter.

As a result, the following line items affecting the consolidated statements of operations have been corrected for these immaterial errors: Consolidated statement of operations: 2009 ($ in millions) As originallyreported Adjustments As reportedbeforediscontinuedoperations Discontinuedoperations As currentlyreported General and administrative expense (803 ) 8 (795 ) 14 (781 ) Provision for income taxes (17 )  (17 ) 7 (10 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (161 ) 8 (153 ) (32 ) (185 ) Basic earnings per share data: Income (loss) from continuing operations (0.75 ) 0.04 (0.71 ) (0.15 ) (0.86 ) 2008 ($ in millions) As originallyreported Adjustments As reportedbeforediscontinuedoperations Discontinuedoperations As currentlyreported General and administrative expense (1,875 ) 43 (1,832 ) 15 (1,817 ) Provision for income taxes (46 )  (46 ) 4 (42 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (3,574 ) 43 (3,531 ) (36 ) (3,567 ) Basic earnings per share data: Income (loss) from continuing operations (19.83 ) 0.24 (19.59 ) (0.20 ) (19.79 ) The per share data of income (loss) from discontinued operations of 2008 and 2009 is not affected by the prior period adjustments. F-12 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated 2 Significant accounting policies and new standards after 2010 Principles for consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company together with its consolidated subsidiaries and all entities in which the Company holds a direct or indirect controlling interest, in such a way that the Company would have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity that could be potentially significant to the Company. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Net income (loss) includes the portion of the earnings of subsidiaries applicable to non-controlling interests. The income (loss) and equity attributable to non-controlling interests are disclosed separately in the consolidated statements of operations and in the consolidated balance sheets under noncontrolling interests. Investments in equity-accounted investees Investments in companies in which the Company does not have the ability to directly or indirectly control the financial and operating decisions, but does possess the ability to exert significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. Generally, in the absence of demonstrable proof of significant influence, it is presumed to exist if at least 20% of the voting stock is owned. The Companys share of the net income of these companies is included in results relating to equity-accounted investees in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an investment occurs. When its share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of an investment accounted for by the equity method, the carrying amount of that investment is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued unless the Company has guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support for the investee. Accounting for capital transactions of a subsidiary or an equity-accounted investee Until 2009 the Companys policy was to recognize in income dilution gains or losses arising from the sale or issuance of stock by a subsidiary that is included in the consolidated financial statements or an unconsolidated entity which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting in the consolidated statement of operations, unless the Company or the subsidiary either has reacquired or plans to reacquire such shares. In such instances, the result of the transaction was recorded directly in equity. Following the adoption on January 1, 2009 of SFAS No. 160 Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements: an amendment of ARB No. 51 which has subsequently been included in ASC 810, the Company recognizes for transactions occurring after December 31, 2008 dilution gains or losses related to changes in ownership of consolidated entities directly in equity. In case of loss of control of the subsidiary following such transaction the dilution gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. In accordance with ASC 323-10, paragraph 40-1, any dilution gain or loss related to entities in which the Company has a non-controlling interest is recognized in the statement of operations. Dilution gains or losses are presented in the consolidated statement of operations in the line item other income and expense upon loss of control of subsidiaries in accordance with ASC 810. Dilution gains and losses related to equity-accounted investees are presented in the line item results relating to equity-accounted investees. F-13 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated Foreign currencies The Company uses the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency. For consolidation purposes, the financial statements of the entities within the Company with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rates on the applicable balance sheet dates. Income and expense items in the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at monthly exchange rates in the periods involved. The effects of translating the financial position and results of operations from functional currencies are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity. Cumulative translation adjustments are recognized as income or expense upon partial or complete disposal or substantially complete liquidation of a foreign entity. The following table sets out the exchange rates for euros into US dollars applicable for translation of NXPs financial statements for the periods specified. $1 per  period end average(1) high low 2008 1.4061 1.4768 1.2749 1.5801 2009 1.4402 1.3978 1.2683 1.4916 2010 1.3370 1.3326 1.2183 1.4402 (1) The average rates are the accumulated average rates based on monthly quotations. The functional currency of foreign entities is generally the local currency, unless the primary economic environment requires the use of another currency. When foreign entities conduct their business in economies considered to be highly inflationary, they record transactions in the Companys reporting currency instead of their local currency. Gains and losses arising from the translation or settlement of non-functional currency-denominated transactions, monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recognized in income in the period in which they arise. However, currency differences on intercompany loans that have the nature of a permanent investment are accounted for as translation differences as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments principally in the management of its foreign currency risks. The Company measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values derived from market prices of the instruments or from option pricing models, as appropriate, and records these as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair values are immediately recognized in the statement of operations unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. The Company formally assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions and for which cash flow hedge accounting is applied, are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. When it is established that a derivative is not highly F-14 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur within a period of two months from the originally forecasted transaction date, the Company continues to carry the derivative on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings. In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the Company continues to carry the derivative at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, and recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings. The application of cash flow hedge accounting for foreign currency risks is limited to transactions that represent a substantial currency risk that could materially affect the financial position of the Company. Consequently, the application of cash flow hedge accounting seldom occurs. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at acquisition that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. It also includes cash balances that cannot be freely repatriated. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at face value. Receivables Receivables are carried at face value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts. As soon as trade accounts receivable can no longer be collected in the normal way and are expected to result in a loss, they are designated as doubtful trade accounts receivable and valued at the expected collectible amounts. They are written off when they are deemed to be uncollectible because of bankruptcy or other forms of receivership of the debtors. The allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable takes into account objective evidence about credit-risk concentration, collective debt risk based on average historical losses, and specific circumstances such as serious adverse economic conditions in a specific country or region. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, less advance payments on work in progress. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The costs of conversion of inventories include direct labor and fixed and variable production overheads, taking into account the stage of completion. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. An allowance is made for the estimated losses due to obsolescence. This allowance is determined for groups of products based on purchases in the recent past and/or expected future demand. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expense and waste are not capitalized in inventory. The allocation of fixed production overheads to the inventory cost is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Other non-current financial assets Other non-current financial assets include available-for-sale securities and cost-method investments. The Company classifies its investment in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values based on quoted market prices as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in other comprehensive income in equity. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a F-15 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated separate component of other comprehensive income until realized. Fair value measurement is based on quoted market prices for the assets. If these are not available, the Company uses other observable inputs, such as quoted market prices for similar assets. Lacking also that information, the Company uses unobservable inputs such as discounted projected cash flows. Available-for-sale securities that are contractually restricted from sale for a period longer than 1 year are accounted for by the cost method without changes in fair value being reflected in their measurement unless they are other than temporarily impaired in which case the impairment loss is charged to earnings. Similarly, restricted equity securities obtained as payment from the acquirer upon disposal of product lines are accounted for under the cost method. NXP recognizes in nonmonetary transactions initially the fair value of the assets surrendered or received, whichever is more reliably determinable, as consideration for acquired equity securities, as its interest in the acquirer at transaction date, which is the new cost basis going forward. Impairments of financial assets A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. The Company assesses its long-term investments accounted for as available-for-sale on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other-than-temporary, in which case the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss realized in the period in which it occurs. When the decline is determined to be temporary, the unrealized loses are included in other comprehensive income. If objective evidence indicates that cost-method investments need to be tested for impairment, calculations are based on information derived from business plans and other information available for estimating their fair value. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Assets constructed by the Company include direct costs, overheads and interest charges incurred during the construction period. Government investment grants are deducted from the cost of the related asset. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected economic life of the asset. Depreciation of special tooling is also based on the straight-line method unless a depreciation method other than the straight-line method better represents the consumption pattern. Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in other income and expense. Costs related to repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the period in which they are incurred unless leading to an extension of the original lifetime or capacity. Plant and equipment under capital leases are initially recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments. These assets and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company recognizes the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred based on discounted projected cash flows in the absence of other observable inputs such as quoted prices, while an equal amount is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and subsequently depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Leases The Company leases various office space and equipment. Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. F-16 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated Leases in which the Company has substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the leases commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation. The lease obligations are included in other current and other non-current liabilities. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the assets and the lease term. Goodwill The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805-30. Accordingly, goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever impairment indicators require so. Previously, the Company carried out the annual impairment test in the third quarter. Due to changes in the Companys internal forecasting process in 2010, it was determined to be preferable to move the annual test to the fourth quarter. In order to comply with the ASC 805 requirement of testing goodwill for impairment at least once in every 12 month period, the goodwill impairment test was initially carried out in the third quarter of 2010. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, the impairment test is annually executed in the fourth quarter of each financial year. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the assets implied fair value. This determination is made at the business operating segment level, which is for the Company the reporting unit level in accordance with ASC 805, and consists of two steps. First, the Company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the goodwill and intangible assets, to the reporting units. Furthermore, the Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit and compares it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company performs the second step of the impairment test. In the second step, the Company compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to acquisition accounting in a business combination. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair value of the reporting units based on discounted projected cash flows in the absence of other observable inputs such as quoted prices. Intangible assets Intangible assets (other than goodwill) arising from acquisitions are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated economic lives. Remaining useful lives are evaluated every year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The Company considers renewal and extension options in determining the useful life. However, based on experience the Company concluded that these assets have no extension or renewal possibilities. There are currently no intangible assets with indefinite lives. Until 2009, in-process research and development with no alternative use was written off immediately upon acquisition. As from 2009 upon adoption of SFAS 141(R) Business CombinationsRevised as per January 1, 2009, which has been codified in ASC 350-30, in-process R&D is capitalized and indefinitely lived until completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. The indefinitely lived assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment until the completion or abandonment, upon which the assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives. Patents, trademarks and other intangible assets acquired from third parties are capitalized at cost and amortized over their remaining useful lives. F-17 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated Certain costs relating to the development and purchase of software for internal use are capitalized and subsequently amortized over the estimated useful life of the software in conformity with ASC 350-40. Impairment or disposal of intangible assets other than goodwill and tangible fixed assets The Company accounts for intangible and tangible fixed assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company determines the fair value based on discounted projected cash flows. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where discrete cash flows occur that are largely independent of other cash flows in the absence of other observable inputs such as quoted prices. For the Manufacturing Operations segment, the review of impairment of long-lived assets is carried out on a Company-wide basis, as Manufacturing Operations is the shared manufacturing base for the other business segments with, for this purpose, no discrete cash flows that are largely independent of other cash flows. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable. For the sale to be highly probable, (i) the appropriate level of management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset, (ii) an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan must be initiated, (iii) the asset must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, (iv) the sale should generally be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification and (v) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the assets carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. The Company determines the fair value based on discounted projected cash flows in the absence of other observable inputs such as quoted prices. Depreciation or amortization of an asset ceases when it is classified as held for sale, or included within a disposal group that is classified as held for sale. Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Company that either has been disposed of, or that is classified as held for sale, and: (i) represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Company in terms of operations and cash flows or (ii) is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Generally, a major line of business is a segment or business unit. Discontinued operations are carried at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. The Company determines the fair value based on discounted projected cash flows in the absence of other observable inputs such as quoted prices. Results from discontinued operations until the date of disposal are presented separately as a single amount in the consolidated statements of operations together with any gain or loss from disposal. Results from operations qualifying as discontinued F-18 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated operations as of the balance sheet date for the latest period presented, that have previously been presented as results from continuing operations, are re-presented as results from discontinued operations for all periods presented. The financial information of discontinued operations is excluded from the respective captions in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for all years presented. Research and development Costs of research and development are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for In-process research and development assets acquired in a business combinations since 2009, which are capitalized and after completion are amortized over their useful lives. Advertising Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Provisions and accruals The Company recognizes provisions for liabilities and probable losses that have been incurred as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and for which the amount is uncertain but can be reasonably estimated. Provisions of a long-term nature are stated at present value when the amount and timing of related cash payments are fixed or reliably determinable unless discounting is prohibited under US GAAP. Short-term provisions are stated at face value. The Company accrues for losses associated with environmental obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the Company accrues for certain costs such as compensation and benefits for employees directly involved in the remediation activities. Measurement of liabilities is based on current legal requirements and existing technology. Liabilities and expected insurance recoveries, if any, are recorded separately. The carrying amount of liabilities is regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts or changes in law or technology. Restructuring The provision for restructuring relates to the estimated costs of initiated reorganizations that have been approved by the Management Team, and which involve the realignment of certain parts of the industrial and commercial organization. When such reorganizations require discontinuance and/or closure of lines of activities, the anticipated costs of closure or discontinuance are included in restructuring provisions only when the liability is incurred in accordance with ASC 420-10-25. The liability is initially measured at fair value. The Company determines the fair value based on discounted projected cash flows in the absence of other observable inputs such as quoted prices. These liabilities, in as far as related to one-time employee termination benefits are recognized, in accordance with ASC 420-10-25, ratably over the future service period when those employees are required to render services to the Company, if that period exceeds 60 days or a longer legal notification period. However, generally employee termination benefits are covered by a contract or an ongoing benefit arrangement and are recognized in accordance with ASC 712-10-15 when it is probable that the employees will be entitled to the benefits and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. F-19 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated Guarantees The Company complies with ASC 460-10-55. In accordance with this ASC Guarantees, the Company recognizes, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability at the fair value of the obligation incurred, for guarantees within the scope of the recognition criteria. The Company determines the fair value based on either quoted prices for similar guarantees or discounted projected cash flows, whichever is available. Debt and other liabilities Debt and other liabilities, other than provisions, are stated at amortized cost. Debt issue costs are not expensed immediately but are reported as deferred charges and subsequently amortized over the term of the debt using the effective interest rate method. Unless the exchange would meet the criteria for troubled debt restructuring, debt that has been exchanged for other debt is initially measured at fair value in accordance with the provisions of ASC 470-50. Any gain or loss resulting from the exchange and adjusted for the unamortized portion of debt issue costs for the exchanged debt is immediately recognized in the statement of operations on the line item Financial income (expense). The Company determines the fair value based on quoted prices for the instruments or quoted prices for similar instruments. In the rare cases that such observable inputs are not available the Company determines the fair value based on discounted projected cash flows. Loans that are hedged under a fair value hedge are remeasured for the changes in the fair value that are attributable to the risk that is being hedged. Revenue recognition The Companys revenues are primarily derived from made-to-order sales to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and similar customers. The Companys revenues are also derived from sales to distributors. The Company applies the guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 13 Revenue Recognition and recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the service has been provided, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured, based on the terms and conditions of the sales contract. For made-to-order sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped and delivered to the customer and title and risk have passed to the customer. Examples of delivery conditions typically meeting these criteria are Free on board point of delivery and Costs, insurance paid point of delivery. Generally, the point of delivery is the customers warehouse. Acceptance of the product by the customer is generally not contractually required, since, for made-to-order customers, design approval occurs before manufacturing and subsequently delivery follows without further acceptance protocols. Payment terms used are those that are customary in the particular geographic market. When management has established that all aforementioned conditions for revenue recognition have been met and no further post-shipment obligations exist, revenue is recognized. For sales to distributors, the same recognition principles apply and similar terms and conditions as for sales to other customers are applied. However, for some distributors contractual arrangements are in place, which allow these distributors to return products if certain conditions are met. These conditions generally relate to the time period during which return is allowed and reflect customary conditions in the particular geographic market. Other return conditions relate to circumstances arising at the end of a product life cycle, when certain distributors are permitted to return products purchased during a pre-defined period after the Company has announced a products pending discontinuance. Long notice periods associated with these announcements prevent significant amounts of product from being returned, however. Repurchase agreements with OEMs or distributors are not entered into by the Company. F-20 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated For sales where return rights exist, the Company has determined, based on historical data, that only a very small percentage of the sales to this type of distributors is actually returned. In accordance with these historical data, a pro rata portion of the sales to these distributors is not recognized but deferred until the return period has lapsed or the other return conditions no longer apply. Revenues are recorded net of sales taxes, customer discounts, rebates and similar charges. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recognized as revenues. Expenses incurred for shipping and handling costs of internal movements of goods are recorded as cost of revenues. Shipping and handling costs related to revenues to third parties are reported as selling expenses. A provision for product warranty is made at the time of revenues recognition and reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by the Company with respect to the sold products. In cases where the warranty period is extended and the customer has the option to purchase such an extension, which is subsequently billed separately to the customer, revenues recognition related to the warranty extension occurs on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Royalty income, which is generally earned based upon a percentage of revenues or a fixed amount per product sold, is recognized on an accrual basis. Royalty income, other license income or other income related to R&D arrangements and that is received in the form of non-refundable upfront payments is recognized as income pro rata over the term of the contract unless a separate earnings process has been completed. Government grants, other than those relating to purchases of assets, are recognized as income as qualified expenditures are made. Software revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 985-605-25 Software Revenue Recognition when the 4 criteria of SAB Topic 13 are met. Income taxes Income taxes in the consolidated financial statements are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Income tax is recognized in the statement of operations except to the extent that it relates to an item that is initially recognized directly within equity, including other comprehensive income (loss), in which case the related tax effect is also recognized there. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using the applicable tax rates for the years, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Income tax payable includes amounts payable to tax authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the change. Deferred tax assets, including assets arising from loss carryforwards, are recognized, net of a valuation allowance, if it is more likely than not that the asset or a portion thereof will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. Deferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes are recognized for subsidiaries in situations where the income is to be paid out as dividends in the foreseeable future, to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable and deductible. Income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The income tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits including related interest F-21 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated and penalties is recorded under provisions in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on the timing of the expected payment. Penalties are recorded as income tax expense, whereas interest is reported as financial expense in the statement of operations. Benefit accounting The Company accounts for the cost of pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions in accordance with ASC 715 Compensation-Retirement Benefits. The Company employees participate in pension and other postretirement benefit plans in many countries. The costs of pension and other postretirement benefits and related assets and liabilities with respect to the Companys employees participating in defined-benefit plans have been allocated to the Company based upon actuarial valuations. Some of the Companys defined-benefit pension plans are funded with plan assets that have been segregated and restricted in a trust, foundation or insurance company to provide for the pension benefits to which the Company has committed itself. The net pension liability or asset recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the projected defined-benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date. Most of our plans result in a pension provision (no assets for the plan) or a net pension liability. The projected defined-benefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Pension costs in respect of defined-benefit pension plans primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for pension benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of the expected return on plan assets and net of employee contributions. Actuarial gains and losses arise mainly from changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. They are recognized in the statement of operations, over the expected average remaining service periods of the employees with applying the corridor. Events which invoke a curtailment or a settlement of a benefit plan will be recognized in our statement of operations if such event has a material impact on our results. Unrecognized prior-service costs related to pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions are being amortized by assigning a proportional amount to the statements of operations of a number of years, reflecting the average remaining service period of the active employees. Obligations for contributions to defined-contribution and multi-employer pension plans are recognized as an expense in the statements of operations as incurred. In accordance with the requirements of ASC 715, if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, we recognize in the consolidated balance sheet a liability that equals the excess. If the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation, we shall recognize in its statement of financial position an asset that equals the excess. The Company determines the fair value based on quoted prices for the plan assets or comparable prices for non-quoted assets. For a defined-benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement defined benefit plan it is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. F-22 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated The Company recognizes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs that arise during the year but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to ASC 715. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, including the gains or losses and the prior services costs are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to the recognition provisions of ASC 715. For all of the Companys defined pension benefit plans, the measurement date on which it determines the funded status is year-end. Share-based compensation Share-based payment plans were first introduced by NXP Semiconductors N.V. for NXP employees in 2007 and new plans were introduced in 2010 after NXP Semiconductors initial public offering of common shares in the United States. All plans are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation at the estimated fair value of the equity instruments measured at the grant date. For the grants issued up to August 2010 under the 2007 plans, the Company used a binomial option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of the options and determines the fair value of the equity rights on the basis of the estimated fair value of the Company, using a discounted cash flow technique. For the grants issued since August 2010 under the 2010 plans the Company used the Black-Scholes-Merton method. The estimated fair value of the equity instruments is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis taking into account estimated forfeitures. The share-based compensation plans that the Companys employees participate in contain contingent cash settlement features upon an exit or change in control in combination with a termination of employment. The Company has concluded that the likelihood of these events occurring is remote and therefore not probable. Also, upon death or disablement the Company may offer cash settlement, but the employee or his dependents must consent. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the requirement in ASC 718 that share options and restricted shares that have contingent cash settlement features that are outside the control of the employee, such as a change in control or the death or disability of an employee, to be accounted for as liabilities rather than equity if the contingent event is probable of occurring, is not applicable to the Company. However, in the case that for certain employees the vested share-based payment rights have been declared to become cash settled such instruments will be recorded as liabilities at fair value as from the date of such event. During 2009, NXP Semiconductors N.V. executed an option exchange program for options granted in 2007, 2008 and 2009, and which were estimated to be deeply out of the money. Under this option exchange program, options with new exercise prices, different volumes andin certain casesrevised vesting schedules were granted to eligible individuals, in exchange for their owned options. By accepting the new options, all options (vested and unvested) owned by the eligible individuals were cancelled. As of May 2009 until August 2010, options have been granted to eligible individuals under the revised stock option program. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 the unrecognized portion of the compensation costs of the cancelled options continues to be recognized over their remaining requisite vesting period. For the replacement options the compensation costs are determined as the difference between the fair value of the cancelled options immediately before the grant date of the replacement option and the fair value of these replacement options at the grant date. This compensation cost will be recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule over the remaining vesting period. In November 2010, following NXP Semiconductors N.V. becoming a listed company, a new option program and share program was launched in addition to the existing option program and equity rights program. Cash flow statements Cash flow statements have been prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated into U.S. dollar using the weighted average rates of exchange for the periods involved. F-23 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated Cash flows from derivative instruments that are accounted for as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. Cash flows from other derivative instruments are classified consistent with the nature of the instrument. Concentration of risk The Companys revenues are for a large part dependent on a limited number of customers, none of which individually exceeds 10% of total revenues. Furthermore, the Company is using outside suppliers of foundries for a portion of its manufacturing capacity. Accounting standards adopted in 2010 Following accounting pronouncements that are of relevance to the Company became effective in 2010 and were adopted by the Company.  ASU 2009-16. Transfer and Servicing (ASU Topic 860) On 12 June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2009-16. The most significant amendments resulting from ASU 2009-16 consist of the removal of the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) from Statement 140, and the elimination of the exception for QSPEs from the consolidation guidance of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)). In addition, ASU 2009-16 amends and clarifies sale accounting and requires among others that a transferor recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained and liabilities incurred as a result of a sale while eliminating the practicability exception for the measurement at fair value. ASU 2009-16 is effective as of 1 January 2010 and has been codified in ASC 860. The Company adopted the accounting guidance as of its effective date. The Company has evaluated the consequences of ASU 2009-16 and concluded since it is currently not involved with any QSPE, this element of the ASU does not affect the Company. With regard to the transfer of assets guidance, the ASU had no impact in 2010 but may affect future transactions, if any.  ASU No. 2010-06. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) On January 21, 2010 the FASB issued ASU 2010-06. The ASU amends ASC 820 to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. It also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The impact for NXP is limited to disclosures about transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3, which, however, seldom occur.  ASU 2009-17. Consolidation (ASC Topic 810) On 12 June 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-17, which (1) addresses the effects of eliminating the qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) concept from FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities and (2) modifies some provisions about the application of certain key provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)). ASU 2009-17 has been codified in ASC 810 and became effective for NXP as of 2010. It requires among other things a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) and amends certain guidance for determining F-24 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated whether an entity is a VIE, which may change an enterprises assessment of which entities with which it is involved are VIEs. Furthermore, it requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The Company has reconsidered its consolidation conclusions for all entities with which it is involved and concluded that the new guidance will not result in the consolidation of new entities or deconsolidation of entities.  ASU No. 2010-20 Receivables (ASC 310). Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses The ASU was issued by the FASB in July 2010. Extended disclosures are required for trade accounts receivable with a contractual maturity exceeding 1 year and resulting from delivering of goods or rendering services. In the exceptional cases where this occurs, the amounts are insignificant and therefore this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact for the Company. The new rules are effective for NXP as of 2010. New standards to be adopted after 2010 The FASB issued several pronouncements, of which the following are to various degrees of relevance to the Company and which were not yet effective in 2010.  Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements; a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ASU 2009-13, issued in October 2009, changes the guidance regarding revenues recognition for multiple-element arrangement and relaxes some of the earlier requirements. Since NXP is rarely involved in these types of arrangements the impact is expected to be infrequent and preliminarily estimated to be insignificant. The new guidance becomes effective prospectively for the Company for arrangements entered into or materially modified after December 31, 2010.  ASU No. 2010-17 Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method (ASC 605). A consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force The ASU specifically affects vendors that provide research or development deliverables in an arrangement in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving uncertain future events or circumstances. NXP is rarely involved in these types of arrangements although the Company has collaborative development contracts with third parties. Generally, these take the form of upfront payments and subsequent cost-sharing arrangements but do not contain milestones as defined in the Master Glossary of the ASC. The current accounting policies applied to these arrangements do vary with the type of contractual provisions. We either use a milestone method for the majority of the contractual amounts or a pro rata basis. The Company does not foresee to change its current accounting policy. Therefore we have concluded that this ASU will not have a significant effect on the Companys financial statements and is also not expected to have in the foreseeable future. The ASU becomes effective for NXP as of July, 2010. 3 Discontinued operations On December 22, 2010, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement whereby Knowles Electronics, an affiliate of Dover Corporation, will acquire the Companys Sound Solutions business, the leading provider of speaker and receiver components for the mobile handset market. Under the terms of the agreement, Knowles will acquire Sound Solutions for $855 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close on or about the end of the first quarter of 2011. F-25 Notes to the consolidated financial statements of NXP Semiconductors N.V.(Continued) All amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated The financial results attributable to the Companys interest in Sound Solutions (formerly included in the Companys Standard Products segment) have been presented as discontinued operations. The following table summarizes the results of the Sound Solutions business included in the consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations for 2008, 2009 and 2010: 2008 2009 2010 Revenues 339 324 354 Costs and expenses (299 ) (285 ) (283 ) Operating income (loss) 40 39 71 Income (loss) before taxes 40 39 71 Provision for income taxes (4 ) (7 ) (12 ) Net income (loss) from discontinued operations 36 32 59 The following table presents the assets and liabilities held for sale of the Sound Solutions business, classified as discontinued operations, in the consolidated balance sheets as at December 31, 2009 and 2010: December 31, 2009 2010 Cash and cash equivalents 15 10 Amounts receivables 66 78 Inventories 20 19 Property, plant and equipment 33 27 Intangible assets including goodwill 255 231 Other assets 11 11 Assets of discontinued operations 400 376 Accounts payable 26 30 Provisions 16 9 Deferred tax liabilities 15 12 Other liabilities 37 29 Liabilities of discontinued operations 94 80
