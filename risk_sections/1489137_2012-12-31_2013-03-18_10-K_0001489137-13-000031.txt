ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the more material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively affected.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe production of rare earth products is a capital-intensive business and our ongoing modernization and expansion efforts at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility will require the commitment of substantial resources. Any unanticipated costs or delays associated with our ongoing modernization and expansion efforts at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our ongoing modernization and expansion efforts at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility require the commitment of substantial resources for operating expenses and capital expenditures. We currently expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $1.45 billion for the modernization, expansion and other capital projects at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, including for engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC, preliminary engineering, insurance, permitting, legal, start-up, commissioning and other costs. This estimate does not include capitalized interest.We have encountered cost pressures during the modernization and expansion efforts at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility that have led to significantly higher costs than previously expected. We are continuing to re-evaluate the impact of cost pressures on the budget, and we will incur additional costs if our mitigation measures are not successful. To date, our mitigation measures have not been successful in offsetting all additional costs. In addition, our estimated expenses may increase as consultants, personnel and equipment associated with advancing development and commercial production are added. The progress of our modernization and expansion efforts at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility and the amounts and timing of expenditures will depend in part on the following:•the replacement of a significant portion of the existing process, plant and equipment that consists of aging or outdated facilities and equipment, retooling and development and the preparation of the mine pit for renewed production of ore;•maintaining required federal, state and local permits; •the results of consultants’ analysis and recommendations; •negotiating contracts for equipment, earthwork, construction, equipment installation, labor and completing infrastructure and construction work; •negotiating sales and off-take contracts for our planned production; •the execution of any joint venture agreements or similar arrangements with strategic partners; and •other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Most of these activities require significant lead times and must be advanced concurrently. In addition, we have experienced delays associated with our modernization and expansion efforts at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. We had expected that our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility would be operational during the fourth quarter of 2012 to a level that would have allowed us to achieve an annualized run rate of 19,050 mt beginning in 2013. However, we have recently decided to ramp up operations at Molycorp Mountain Pass in the beginning of 2013 in order to achieve a full run rate by mid-year. As a result, our production in the first half of 2013 will be substantially lower than expected, leading to reduced revenues and cash flows, as well as higher costs for our other operations that must continue to purchase raw materials from third parties rather than accepting delivery of lower cost products from our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. In addition, our chloralkali plant has not yet been completed and it is essential to allowing us to realize lower production costs. Any unanticipated costs or other delays associated with our ongoing modernization and expansion efforts at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and could require us to seek additional capital, which may not 19Table of Contentsbe available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.We may be unsuccessful in generating, securing and raising the necessary capital to execute our current business plan. Under our current business plan, we expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $1.45 billion for modernization, expansion and other capital projects at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, as well as EPC, preliminary engineering, insurance, permitting, legal, start-up, commissioning and other costs. This estimate does not include capitalized interest.While we have initiated measures to mitigate certain adverse cost trends and are continuing to re-evaluate the impact of cost pressures on the budget, we will incur additional costs if our mitigation measures are not successful. We expect to finance the remaining capital expenditures and other capital expenditures related to operations at the Molycorp Mountain Pass facility and all other operating facilities, our selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as our working capital requirements with the net proceeds to us from our issuance of convertible notes and common stock in January 2013, cash on hand, anticipated cash flows from operations at certain segments and potential proceeds from revolving credit facilities or certain equipment financing. We have no firm commitments for any revolving credit facilities or equipment financing and can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain any commitments on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, the full funding of our current business plan continues to be dependent on (i) our cost estimates for capital expenditures being accurate, (ii) our ability to ramp up run rates at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility pursuant to our expectations without delays, (iii) market conditions remaining the same as we are currently experiencing without deterioration (we estimate that a 15% drop in market prices for all REEs would reduce our estimated consolidated cash balance as of December 31, 2013 by approximately $80 million and that a 15% drop in volumes would reduce our estimated consolidated cash balance as of December 31, 2013 by approximately $90 million) and that we are able to sell all our production at such prices (we may not be able to obtain such prices), (iv) our anticipated production increases at our facilities beginning later in the first quarter of 2013 based on seasonality, (v) our ability to sell our entire production of REO and (vi) the absence of payments on current and future contingent liabilities. If these assumptions prove incorrect, or the other factors described in this "Risk Factors" section occur, our estimates could prove incorrect and we may need additional financing. We believe the net proceeds from our January 2013 debt and equity offerings provide sufficient liquidity under our current business plan, but such proceeds may not be adequate should our estimates change.In the event that we are unable to obtain additional financing or we are not successful in curtailing and/or deferring capital expenditures we would have a liquidity shortfall and would be unable to execute our current business plan.The actual amount of capital required for the expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility may vary materially from our current estimates, in which case we would need to raise additional funds, which may delay completion and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The anticipated funding required to complete the expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility is based on certain estimates and assumptions we have made about the additional facilities, equipment, labor, permits and other factors required to complete the project. If any of these estimates or assumptions change, the actual timing and amount of capital required to complete the expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, including any future expansions, may vary materially from what we anticipate. Additional funds may be required in the event of significant departures from our current expansion and modernization plan, unforeseen delays, cost overruns, engineering design changes or other unanticipated expenses. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it can be obtained on a timely basis and on commercially acceptable terms. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement the expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility within our current timetable, that the actual costs of the capacity expansion will not exceed our current estimated costs or that we will be able to secure off-take agreements for the incremental production capacity, and we cannot provide any assurance as to the actual operating costs once we have completed the capacity expansion. Our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility is the foundation for our vertical integration strategy and is the largest, most fully developed rare earth mine outside of China. It has been producing rare earth products for approximately 60 years. Upon reaching a planned annual run rate of 19,050 mt of REO and upon completion of our chloralkali plant (expected later in 2013), we expect our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility to have production cash costs lower than those publicly reported by Chinese government officials and those reported for other non-Chinese rare earth projects. Although the expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility was planned to allow an expanded annual run rate of up to 40,000 mt of REO, we will not expand production beyond the initial planned run rate unless market demand, product pricing, capital availability and financial returns justify such production. In certain cases, including the separation process and power generation, we will need to install 20Table of Contentsadditional capacity. We do not believe we will need to obtain additional permits for the future expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, other than air and certain building permits and the modification of existing permits after 2021 in connection with the expansion of the pit boundary at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. However there is no assurance that we will not, in the future, learn of permits that we will be required to obtain or existing permits that we will be required to modify. We may not be able to realize the benefits of the expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility or be able to produce at the costs we are expecting. Any failure to successfully implement the expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility due to insufficient funding, delays or unanticipated costs, or to realize the anticipated benefits of the expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, including securing off-take commitments for the incremental production, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our growth depends in large part on the modernization and expansion of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, which is our only rare earth mining facility. Our only rare earth mining facility at this time is our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. Our continued viability is based on successfully implementing our strategy, including completion of the expansion and modernization of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility in accordance with our expected timeframe. The deterioration or destruction of any part of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility may significantly hinder our ability to reach or maintain full planned run rates within the expected time frame or at all. If we are unsuccessful in reaching and maintaining full planned run rates for REO at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, within expected time frames or at all, we may not be able to build a sustainable or profitable business. We may not successfully establish or maintain collaborative, joint venture and licensing arrangements, or establish new ones, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our rare earth products. A key element of our business strategy is to utilize vertical integration through further downstream processing of our REO into rare earth metal alloys and finished magnets for clean-energy, high-technology and defense applications. Our acquisitions of Molycorp Silmet and MMA, our joint venture agreement with Mitsubishi and Daido, and the Molycorp Canada Acquisition reflect this strategy. To implement this vertical integration strategy successfully, we may need to form other joint ventures with existing magnet producers for the final production of finished rare earth magnets. In addition, other licenses that may be necessary for some of these downstream processing steps have not yet been obtained. Any failure to establish or maintain collaborative, joint venture or licensing arrangements for the production of downstream products on favorable terms could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition or ability to develop and commercialize downstream rare earth products.We may not be able to enter into binding contracts with customers for the sale of REO products, or meet the conditions necessary for customers to commence purchasing under existing contracts, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are working to establish stable revenue streams for the rare earth minerals and products we manufacture at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, or Resources segment, Chemicals and Oxides segment and Magnetic Materials and Alloys segment. The last two segments include facilities acquired as part of the Molycorp Canada Acquisition. As of December 31, 2012, we have allocated 48% of our expected annual run rate of 19,050 mt of REO to existing contracts with customers, 8% to support our Molycorp Magnequench subsidiary and 23% for potential SorbXTM sales, for a total of 79% of the 19,050 mt of REO that we initially intend to produce annually at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. The market for SorbXTM is not yet fully developed. We still need to find buyers for the remaining production. A substantial portion of the remaining production (plus amounts if SorbXTM does not become accepted) is cerium, which is in surplus and prices of which have significantly declined since 2011. We intend to enter into other short-term sales contracts and into long-term sales contracts with existing and new customers for amounts not in excess of our actual planned production. As a result of the acquisition of Molycorp Silmet and Molycorp Canada, we now have the ability to allocate a portion of our production from the Molycorp Mountain Pass facility to our downstream fully vertically integrated subsidiaries around the world. We currently estimate that this portion is between 4,000 mt and 7,000 mt per year.The failure to enter into binding contracts, or the failure to meet the conditions necessary for customers to commence purchasing under existing agreements, or failure to allocate production to our downstream subsidiaries, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.21Table of ContentsWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for, and prices of, rare earth products. Because our primary source of revenue is the sale of rare earth minerals and products, changes in demand for, and the market price of, rare earth minerals and products could significantly affect our profitability. The value and price of our common and preferred stock and our financial results may be adversely affected by declines in the prices of rare earth minerals and products. Rare earth minerals and product prices fluctuate and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as interest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies on the world market, global and regional supply and demand for rare earth minerals and products, and the political and economic conditions of countries that produce rare earth minerals and products. As a result of the global economic crisis, rare earth product prices declined by approximately 50% between 2008 and the end of the third quarter of 2009. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the increases in market prices, as seen during 2010 and most of 2011, will occur again or be sustained in future periods. For example, pricing for REEs has experienced significant volatility over the past several years due to a number of factors: the recent global financial crisis; a severe contraction by China, beginning in 2010, of rare earths it allowed for export; China's continuing efforts to institute stronger environmental reforms across its rare earth industry, force industry consolidation, and constrict rare earth production; a build-up of stockpiles by rare earth consumers and government entities; and a general lack of certainty among rare earth customers regarding the reliability of the future supply of REEs. Although current prices for all REEs remain significantly higher than historic (pre-2010) levels, sales prices for REEs, as well as demand for REEs, began to weaken in the second quarter of 2012 and continued to decline through the end of the year. For example, average prices for lanthanum oxide and cerium oxide have decreased significantly from their peak in July 2011 due, in part, to a reduction in reported speculative buying of rare earth materials in China, to flooding in Thailand leading to slower production in Asia and to a global economic slowdown. We believe the persistent global economic weakness combined with the anticipation of the falling prices of REEs (which generally results in a very conservative purchasing pattern by our customers) unfavorably impacted the volume of products we shipped at our Molycorp Mountain Pass, Molycorp Canada and Silmet facilities in the fourth quarter of 2012 and negatively affected our revenue and cash flows from operations. Protracted periods of low prices and demand for rare earth minerals and products such that we saw in 2012 could significantly reduce revenues and the availability of required development funds in the future. This could cause substantial reductions to, or a suspension of, REO production operations, impair asset values and reduce our proven and probable rare earth ore reserves.Demand for our products may be impacted by demand for downstream products incorporating rare earths, including hybrid and electric vehicles, wind power equipment and other clean technology products, as well as demand in the general automotive and electronic industries. Lack of growth in these markets may adversely affect the demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In contrast, extended periods of high commodity prices may create economic dislocations that may be destabilizing to rare earth minerals supply and demand and ultimately to the broader markets. Periods of high rare earth mineral market prices generally are beneficial to our financial performance. However, strong rare earth mineral prices, as well as real or perceived disruptions in the supply of rare earth minerals, also create economic pressure to identify or create alternate technologies that ultimately could depress future long-term demand for rare earth minerals and products, and at the same time may incentivize development of otherwise marginal mining properties. We believe this occurred recently, when rising prices in 2011 and the first half of 2012 prompted such industrial substitution. For example, automobile manufacturers have recently announced plans to develop motors for electric and hybrid cars that do not require rare earth metals due to concerns about the available supply of rare earths. If the automobile industry or other industries reduce their reliance on rare earth products, the resulting change in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.Conditions in the rare earth industry have been, and may continue to be, extremely volatile, which could have a material impact on our company. Conditions in the rare earth industry have been extremely volatile, and prices, as well as supply and demand, have been significantly impacted by a number of factors, principally changes in economic conditions and demand for rare earth materials and changes, or perceived changes, in Chinese quotas for export of rare earth materials. As a result of the global economic crisis, rare earth product prices declined by approximately 50% between 2008 and the end of the third quarter of 2009. According to Metal-Pages, from the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of 2011, average prices for rare earths have risen by approximately 1,100%. Furthermore, over the same period, average prices for some of the most common rare earths (cerium oxide, lanthanum oxide, neodymium oxide, and praseodymium oxide) have risen by more than 1,000%. Average prices for lanthanum oxide and cerium oxide decreased by approximately 50% during the second half of 2011 due, in 22Table of Contentspart, to a reduction in reported speculative buying of rare earth materials in China, flooding in Thailand leading to slower production in Asia and a global economic slowdown. Prices remain at lower levels to date in 2013. If conditions in our industry remain volatile, our stock price may continue to exhibit volatility as well. In particular, if prices or demand for rare earths were to decline, our stock price would likely decline, and this could also impair our ability to find purchasers for our products at prices acceptable to us. We face a variety of risks associated with acquiring and integrating new business operations that could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We acquired Molycorp Canada in 2012 for its proven leadership in the development, processing and distribution of technically advanced rare earth products and to achieve greater exposure to China, one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing rare earths consuming market. In 2011, we acquired Molycorp Silmet in order to increase our production capacity for REO and rare earth metals, and acquired MMA in order to provide us with the capability to immediately begin manufacturing and selling rare earth alloys for the production of NdFeB and samarium cobalt, or SmCo, magnets, as well as a variety of other specialty alloys and products. We may in the future pursue other strategic acquisitions that we believe would expand our product offerings and capabilities or complement our business. We have limited experience making such acquisitions. Any acquisition that we make will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. The process of integrating acquired businesses, products or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. We may have difficulty integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise. We may incur costs necessary to reorganize, expand or otherwise modify existing operations to meet future production needs, and we may also incur closure, demolition and carrying costs for portions of properties, for which we have no operational uses. We may also have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization. The process of integrating acquired businesses may also result in a diversion of management’s attention and cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our activities. Additionally, any acquisition that we make may result in the assumption of material liabilities. Businesses and properties we acquire may be in an unexpected condition and may subject us to increased costs and liabilities, including environmental liabilities. The costs and liabilities associated with known risks may be greater than expected, and we may assume unknown liabilities, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Foreign acquisitions involve risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. As a result of these risks, the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions may not be fully realized, if at all, and the acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have a significant amount of goodwill, and any future goodwill impairment charges could adversely impact our results of operations. Following a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $258.3 million that we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012, as of December 31, 2012, we had goodwill of $239.7 million. The future occurrence of potential indicators of impairment affecting any of our reporting units, such as a longer than anticipated soft rare earths pricing environment, loss of some end-markets for our products, a material negative change in relationships with significant customers, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions, weak growth for some of our new applications, and delays in ramping up the Molycorp Mountain Pass facility that may defer our ability to enter into longer term contracts, could result in further goodwill impairment charges, which could adversely impact our net results of operations. See Note 9 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the goodwill impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our business will be adversely affected if we do not successfully implement new processing technologies and capabilities. Our processing technologies and capabilities are key components of our competitive strengths and are expected to contribute to low operating costs and increasing the life of the ore body at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. In the second quarter of 2010, we began to process bastnasite concentrate from our stockpiles in an effort to significantly improve these technologies and capabilities and optimize recovery rates. Although this effort has been successful at pilot-scale level with over 95% recovery, we may not be able to scale the new technology and recovery rates to commercial levels, or may not be able to do so as planned. We are also working to optimize other steps in our production process. Any failure may affect our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the new technologies and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Markets for Molycorp Canada’s rare earths, zirconium or other minor metal-based products are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Molycorp Canada’s future successes depend upon its ability to continue to provide products that achieve market acceptance. As technologies develop, substitutes may be developed for Molycorp 23Table of ContentsCanada’s products that may have an adverse impact on the marketability of Molycorp Canada’s products. Since Molycorp Canada specializes in a limited number of products, there is a risk that their replacement by other products may have a material adverse impact on Molycorp Canada’s sales.We operate in a highly competitive industry. The rare earths mining and processing markets are capital intensive and competitive. Our Chinese competitors may have greater financial resources, as well as other strategic advantages to maintain, improve and possibly expand their facilities. Additionally, the Chinese producers have historically been able to produce at relatively low costs due to domestic economic factors. Even upon successful implementation of the new processing technologies and capabilities at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, if we are not able to achieve anticipated costs of production, then any strategic advantages that our competitors may have over us, such as lower labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business.The success of our business will depend, in part, on the establishment of new uses and markets for rare earth products. The success of our business will depend, in part, on the establishment of new markets by us or third parties for certain rare earth products that may be in low demand. For example, cerium is, and is expected to remain, in global surplus. Although we have developed SorbXTM, a proprietary product and process, primarily consisting of cerium, that removes arsenic and other heavy metals from industrial processing streams and will allow our customers to more safely sequester arsenic and increase their production, SorbXTM has not yet been sold and has yet to be fully commercialized. In addition, although we are developing rare earth products for use in NdFeB magnets, which are used in critical existing and emerging technologies, such as hybrid and electric vehicles, wind power turbines and compact fluorescent lighting, the success of our business depends on creating new markets and successfully commercializing rare earth products in existing and emerging markets. Any unexpected costs or delays in the commercialization of any of the foregoing products and applications could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.An increase in the global supply of rare earth products, dumping and predatory pricing by our competitors may materially adversely affect our profitability. The pricing and demand for our products is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including growth of economic development and the global supply and demand for REO products. According to IMCOA, it is estimated that China accounted for approximately 94% of global REO production in 2011. China also dominates the manufacture of metals and NdFeB magnets from rare earths, a capacity that is not currently found in the United States. Once we reach full planned run rates for REO and other planned downstream products, the increased competition may lead our competitors to engage in predatory pricing behavior. Any increase in the amount of rare earth products exported from other nations and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of potential market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our profitability. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors.Changes in China’s export policy may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In 1999, the government of China introduced an export quota system for the rare earth industry. The Chinese government heightened international supply concerns beginning in August 2009 when China’s Interior Ministry first signaled that it would further restrict exports of Chinese rare earth resources. Citing the importance of REE availability to internal industries and the desire to conserve resources, the Chinese government has announced export quotas, increased export tariffs and introduced a “mining quotas policy” that, in addition to imposing export quotas and export tariffs, also imposes production quotas and limits the issuance of new licenses for rare earth exploration. According to IMCOA, China’s export quotas have decreased from approximately 65,000 mt of rare earth products in 2005 to approximately 30,184 mt of rare earth products in 2011.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Commerce, or MOFCOM, increased China's export quota slightly in 2012, up to 30,996 mt of rare earth products, or approximately 3% from 2011. In 2008, China imposed export taxes of up to 25% on selected REO (primarily heavy REO) and up to 15% for all other REO (primarily light REO). On March 13, 2012, the United States, the European Union and Japan filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the Chinese export policy on REO. If this challenge to the Chinese export policy is successful, there could be increased supply in the world market for REO, which could cause the price of REO to decrease. If the price of REO decreases, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Molycorp Canada has operations in China and its ability to export is subject to certain quotas based on its export history and export value. Historically, Molycorp Canada has been able to secure sufficient quotas to meet its demands. Recent policy changes by MOFCOM, have resulted in the total award of export grants being less than the international demand for REEs. 24Table of ContentsThis shortfall has created market uncertainty and while export prices have risen dramatically, there are no guarantees that the current pricing environment will continue or that MOFCOM will not change its current policy. Any further changes to the quota grants or policy could have a material impact on the results of Molycorp Canada.Changes in China's policy on REO production or the import of rare earth feedstock may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to capture the expected cost reductions in the production of rare earth products at Molycorp Canada's operations in China depends on our ability to import REO into China produced from our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. Restrictions by China on the production of rare earth products in China or the import of REO into China for the production of rare earth products would adversely affect Molycorp Canada's ability to process REO produced from our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility in its operations in China, and have an adverse impact on the results of Molycorp Canada.Power shortages at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility may temporarily delay mining and processing operations and increase costs, which may materially adversely impact our business. Due to its position on the regional electric grid, our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility faces occasional power shortages during peak periods. Instability in electrical supply in past years has caused sporadic outages and brownouts and higher costs. Such outages and brownouts have had a negative impact on production. We are currently installing a natural gas powered co-generation power plant as part of our modernization and expansion of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility to reduce energy costs at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility as well as minimize or eliminate our reliance on the regional electric power grid. If the installation of the co-generation power plant is significantly delayed, we will remain subject to the effects of occasional power outages and brownouts and could experience temporary interruptions of mining and processing operations. We then may be unable to fill customer orders in a timely manner and may be subject to higher power costs at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. As a result, our revenue could be adversely impacted and our relationships with our customers could suffer, adversely impacting our ability to generate future revenue. In addition, if power to our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility is disrupted during certain phases of our REO extraction process, we may incur significant expenses that may adversely affect our business.Increasing costs or limited access to raw materials may adversely affect our profitability. We use significant amounts of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide as chemicals to process REO. We ultimately intend to produce our own hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. The technology we are developing to internally produce hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide has not yet been implemented at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. Accordingly, we purchase hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide in the open market and, as a result, we could be subject to significant volatility in the cost or availability of these chemicals. We may not be able to pass increased prices for these chemicals through to our customers in the form of price increases. A significant increase in the price, or decrease in the availability, of these chemicals before we produce them on site could materially increase our operating costs and adversely affect our profit margins from quarter to quarter. Molycorp Canada is vulnerable to any volatility in the prices of raw materials because it does not currently have long-term supply contracts. The Chinese government is aggressively monitoring and regulating rare earth mining operations. In some cases, it is shutting down or curtailing illegal or environmentally damaging mining activities. This could have an adverse impact on rare earth raw material supply. Although we believe there is an adequate supply of rare earth feedstock for Molycorp Canada’s processing facilities, there is no assurance that the prices of such rare earth feedstock will not rise dramatically, in which case the increased cost of production may have a material adverse effect on the profit margins of Molycorp Canada. Such rises in the prices of rare earth feedstock may be offset by increasing the prices of Molycorp Canada’s rare earth related products; however, there is no assurance that the market will bear such price increases and even if the market will bear such increases, the Molycorp Magnequench business will have an increased cost of production since rare earths are a primary raw material. In addition, if market prices for Performance Materials’ rare earth and zirconium products decline, there is no assurance that raw material prices will decline sufficiently or in tandem to offset the decline in selling prices. The above could have a material effect on Molycorp Canada’s profit margins. Molycorp Canada is also dependent on being able to secure an adequate supply of gallium, indium or rhenium bearing scrap at economic prices, to maintain and grow its recycling business. Fluctuations in transportation costs or disruptions in transportation services could increase competition or impair our ability to supply rare earth minerals or products to our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We transport cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium and didymium oxide products from our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility to our Molycorp Silmet and MMA facilities, and to some of our Molycorp Canada facilities around the world. Finding affordable and dependable transportation is important because it allows us to supply customers, third parties under tolling agreements and our operating facilities around the world. Labor disputes, derailments, adverse weather conditions or 25Table of Contentsother environmental events and changes to rail or ocean freight systems could interrupt or limit available transport services, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and loss of sales potential and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We must process REO to exacting specifications in order to provide customers with a consistently high quality product. An inability to perfect the mineral extraction process to meet individual customer specifications may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We process REO to meet customer needs and specifications and to provide customers with a consistently high quality product and a purity higher than previously achieved in prior mining operations at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. An inability to perfect the mineral extraction process to meet individual customer specifications may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, customer needs and specifications may change with time. Any delay or failure in developing processes to meet changing customer needs and specifications may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Diminished access to water may adversely affect our operations. Processing of REO at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility requires significant amounts of water. The technology we are developing at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility to significantly reduce our need for fresh water, including the proprietary production of our own hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide from waste water at our own chlor-alkali plant, has not yet been constructed. Any decrease or disruption in our available water supply until this technology is successfully developed may have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition or results of operations. Inaccuracies in our estimates of REO reserves and resource deposits could result in lower than expected revenues and higher than expected costs. We base our REO reserve and resource estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by outside firms, which are reviewed by our engineers and geologists. Ore reserve estimates, however, are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of REO reserves and non-reserve REO deposits and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable REO reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as: •geological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience; •assumptions concerning future prices of rare earth products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and •assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies. In April 2012, we revised our reserve estimate. While our probable reserves increased, our proven reserves decreased significantly. Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our REO reserves and non-reserve REO deposits could result in lower than expected revenues and higher than expected costs or a shortened estimated life for the mine at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. Period-to-period conversion of probable rare earth ore reserves to proven ore reserves may result in increases or decreases to the total reported amount of ore reserves. Conversion, an indicator of the success in upgrading probable ore reserves to proven ore reserves, is evaluated annually. Conversion rates are affected by a number of factors, including geological variability, applicable mining methods and changes in safe mining practices, economic considerations and new regulatory requirements. Work stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations.As of December 31, 2012, 236 employees at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility were covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America that expires in March 2015. Also as of December 31, 2012, 176 employees at our Molycorp Silmet facility were unionized employees. A work stoppage at either or both our Molycorp Mountain Pass or 26Table of ContentsMolycorp Silmet facilities could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations.A shortage of skilled technicians and engineers may further increase operating costs, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations. Efficient production of rare earth products using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled technicians and engineers. In addition, our expansion efforts will significantly increase the number of skilled technicians and engineers required to successfully operate our business. In the event that we are unable to hire and train the necessary number of skilled technicians and engineers, there could be an adverse impact on our labor costs and our ability to reach full planned production levels in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We depend on key personnel for the success of our business. We depend on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key employee could have an adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to locate, attract or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for senior management or other key employees if their services are no longer available. Because of the dangers involved in the mining of minerals and the manufacture of mineral products, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages as we conduct our business. The mining of minerals and the manufacture of mineral products involves numerous hazards, including: •unusual and unexpected rock formations affecting ore or wall rock characteristics; •ground or slope failures; •environmental hazards; •industrial accidents; •processing problems; •periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or other acts of God; and •mechanical equipment failure and facility performance problems.Although we maintain insurance to address certain risks involved in our business, such as coverage for pollution liability, property damage, business interruption and workers’ compensation, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. Additionally, we cannot be certain that all claims we may make under our insurance policies will be deemed to be within the scope of, or fully covered by, our policies. Furthermore, we do not maintain coverage for losses resulting from acts of terrorism. We might also become subject to liability for environmental damage or other hazards that may be uninsurable or for which we may elect not to insure because of premium costs or commercial impracticality. These policies contain limits of coverage and exclusions that are typical of such policies generally. For example, our pollution liability policy for our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility has $20.0 million aggregate and per incident limits and excludes, among other things, costs associated with closure, post-closure and reclamation. The payment of such premiums, or the assumption of such liabilities, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are currently subject to litigation, including stockholder class action litigation and derivative litigation and an SEC investigation, the unfavorable outcome of which might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flow. From time to time, we may become subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business. In February 2012, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against us and certain of our current executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The Consolidated Class Action Complaint filed on July 31, 2012 also names most of our Board members and some of our stockholders as defendants, along with other persons and entities. That Complaint alleges 18 claims for relief arising out of alleged: (1) securities fraud in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the proposed class period from February 11, 2011 through November 27Table of Contents10, 2011; and (2) materially untrue or misleading statements in registration statements and prospectuses for our public offering of preferred stock in February 2011 and of common stock in June 2011, in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. Our motion to dismiss that Complaint was filed in October 2012 and is pending. We believe that this lawsuit is without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims.In addition, as of November 21, 2012, a consolidated stockholder derivative lawsuit filed purportedly on our behalf against us (as a nominal defendant) and certain of our directors, executive officers and stockholders is pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In August 2012, a consolidated amended shareholder derivative complaint was filed, asserting causes of action for alleged: (1) breach of fiduciary duty, including the duties of loyalty and due care; (2) breach of fiduciary duty not to trade on or misuse material non-public information; (3) unjust enrichment; and (4) aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. On our behalf, the plaintiffs in the consolidated derivative action seek, among other things, monetary damages, restitution, and an accounting. The defendants filed motions to dismiss and motions to stay that action in October 2012, which are pending. Two additional stockholder derivative lawsuits that were filed in the U.S. District Court in Colorado have been dismissed, but the plaintiffs in those cases are pursuing an appeal of that ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.In August 2012, the staff of the SEC notified us that a formal order of investigation had been issued regarding, among other things, the accuracy of our public disclosures. We are cooperating with the staff of the SEC in connection with the investigation. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, including the current purported class action lawsuit and derivative lawsuits and the SEC investigation, we cannot determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. If the final resolution of any such litigation or proceedings is unfavorable, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially affected. We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States. We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. The consummation of the Molycorp Canada Acquisition will expand our manufacturing presence and geographic reach in Asian markets. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales following the consummation of the Molycorp Canada Acquisition. There are a number of additional risks associated with international business activities, including: •burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors; •requirements for maintaining export licenses granted by the Chinese government for certain Molycorp Canada production; •to the extent cash is held outside of the United States, our repatriation of such cash is subject to the approval of foreign governments and to the potentially adverse impact of foreign and domestic tax laws;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks; •disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA; •potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and •fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these 28Table of Contentsanti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Molycorp Canada’s international operations in China and Thailand are subject to a number of special risks including trade barriers, exchange controls and restrictions on currency conversion, political risks and risks of increased duties, taxes, tariffs and governmental royalties, as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies such as embargos. A change in policies by the Chinese or Thai governments could adversely affect Molycorp Canada’s investment in its production facilities by, among other factors, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation thereof. Despite the activity and progress in developing their legal systems, neither China nor Thailand has a system of laws as comprehensive as in Canada or the United States. Molycorp Canada’s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, which is subject to fluctuations in respect of the currencies of the countries in which Molycorp Canada operates. We expect Molycorp Canada’s revenues to be earned in a number of different currencies. Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates of world currencies could have a positive or negative effect on Molycorp Canada’s reported results on a consolidated basis. Given the constantly changing currency exposures and the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon Molycorp Canada’s future operating results. There can be no assurance that Molycorp Canada will not experience currency losses in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Molycorp Canada’s business, revenues, operating results and financial condition. In the event of a change in the value of the Chinese Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar, there is no assurance, due to competitive pressure, of a corresponding change in selling prices of Molycorp Canada’s products. Molycorp Canada exports a significant portion of its products produced in China. These exports are invoiced and paid for primarily in U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2012, Molycorp Canada held cash, net of bank advances in China and Japan, of $163.3 million in the aggregate. Molycorp Canada does not hedge the impact of revaluation of the Renminbi or the Yen. We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration. We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Damage, disruption, or failure of one or more information technology systems may result in interruptions to our operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to our information technology systems, but our business, financial position or results of operations could be adversely impacted by such interruptions. We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. We have begun the implementation of new enterprise software that we will use for our marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service and accounting functions. If we are not able to successfully implement our new enterprise software in a timely manner across our operating segments, including our international operations, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.Risks Relating to Our DebtOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service and other obligations.We have substantial debt and, as a result, we have significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2012, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1,340.1 million (excluding capital lease obligations of $15.5 million and without giving effect to the equity component of convertible debt or any debt discount), $650.0 million of which was secured indebtedness and $46.1 million of which was indebtedness of our subsidiaries. After giving effect to the issuance in January 2013 of the 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (including the full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option in March 2013) and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had, on a pro forma basis, outstanding total consolidated indebtedness at December 31, 2012 of approximately $1,512.6 million (excluding capital lease obligations of $15.5 million and 29Table of Contentswithout giving effect to the equity component of convertible debt or any debt discount). Our substantial debt could have important consequences to you. For example, it could: •make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our debt and our contractual and commercial commitments and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations; •prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase our senior secured notes tendered to us if there is a change of control, which would constitute a default under the indenture, governing our senior secured notes; •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; •limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments, or general corporate purposes, which may limit the ability to execute our business strategy; •heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions; •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have less debt; •limit management’s discretion in operating our business; •limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy; and •result in higher interest expense if interest rates increase and we have outstanding floating rate borrowings. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Restrictive covenants in the indenture governing our senior secured notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness will restrict our ability to operate our business.The senior secured indenture governing our senior secured notes contains, and agreements governing indebtedness we may incur in the future may contain, covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, make investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with other entities or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally, any asset-based credit facility may require us to maintain certain financial ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default thereunder, which could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the applicable debt immediately due and payable. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness.30Table of ContentsRisks Related to Intellectual PropertyWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, our business may be harmed.Much of the technology used in the markets in which we compete is protected by patents and trade secrets, and our commercial success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and trade secret protection for our products and methods. To compete in these markets, we rely on a combination of trade secret protection, nondisclosure and licensing agreements, patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, including our proprietary rare earth production processes that are not patented. We also have a proven technology and product development group and as of December 31, 2012, held 89 issued and pending U.S. patents and patent applications, and 325 issued and pending international and foreign patents and patent applications. We intend to rely on patented products, such as SorbXTM, and related licensing agreements to establish proprietary markets for low demand REEs. These intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Identifying unauthorized use of our intellectual property may be difficult, and proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs. The enforcement of intellectual property rights is subject to considerable uncertainty, and patent reform laws, including the recently-enacted America Invents Act, and court decisions interpreting such laws, may create additional uncertainty around our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies. If we seek to enforce our rights, we may also be subject to claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. In addition, our intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the United States. In such case, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or our inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could therefore adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. The loss of our patents could also reduce the value of the related products. In addition, the cost to litigate infringements of our intellectual property, or the cost to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement actions by others, could be substantial.Proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to our business. We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, especially where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.In addition, Molycorp Canada's current intellectual property position is dependent primarily on the essential nature of certain fundamental patents covering bonded magnets made with NdFeB powder and Molycorp Canada's manufacturing process for NdFeB powder. The most effective of these patents expires in July 2013. While Molycorp Canada holds a wide range of additional patents and patent applications whose expiration dates extend (and in the case of patent applications, will extend, if issued) beyond 2014, none are of an equally essential nature as Molycorp Canada's fundamental patents and exclusive rights, and therefore Molycorp Canada's competitive position after the expiration of the fundamental patents is likely to be diminished as a result of the expiration of such patents. Molycorp Canada may therefore be unable to defend against new competitors entering the marketplace or maintain its existing pricing power.We may not be able to obtain additional patents and the legal protection afforded by any additional patents may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage.Our ability to obtain additional patents is uncertain and the legal protection afforded by these patents is limited and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, the scope and enforceability of patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States or elsewhere (including the recently enacted America Invents Act) may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Even if patents 31Table of Contentsare issued relating to our products and processes, our competitors may challenge the validity of those patents. Patents also will not protect our products and processes if competitors devise ways of making products without infringing our patents.If we infringe, or are accused of infringing, the intellectual property rights of third parties, it may increase our costs or prevent us from being able to sell our existing products or commercialize new products.There is a risk that we may infringe, or may be accused of infringing, the proprietary rights of third parties, including rights under patents and pending patent applications belonging to third parties that may exist in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Because the patent application process can take several years to complete, and patent applications may remain unpublished for 18 months or more, there may be currently pending applications, including applications of which we are currently unaware, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and processes. In addition, our products and processes may infringe existing patents.Defending ourselves against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert management's attention from our business, which could lead to delays in our expansion and modernization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business. As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we might: •be prohibited from, or delayed in, selling or licensing some of our products or using some of our processes unless the intellectual property holder licenses the applicable intellectual property to us, which it is not required to do; •be required to pay substantial royalties or grant a cross license to our intellectual property to another intellectual property holder; or •be required to redesign a product or process so it does not infringe a third party's intellectual property, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time and ultimately result in an inferior product or process.In addition, we could be subject to claims that our employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of third parties.If we are unable to resolve claims that may be brought against us by third parties related to their intellectual property rights on terms acceptable to us, in addition to paying substantial damages and royalties, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights and be precluded from offering some of our products or using some of our processes.Risks Related to Environmental RegulationOur operations are subject to extensive and costly environmental requirements; and current and future laws, regulations and permits will impose significant costs, liabilities or obligations or could limit or prevent our ability to continue our current operations or to undertake new operations.We are subject to numerous and detailed international, national, federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permits, including those pertaining to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air quality standards, greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions, water usage and disposal, pollution, waste management, plant and wildlife protection, including the protection of endangered species, handling and disposal of radioactive substances, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use, reclamation and restoration of properties, the discharge of materials into the environment and groundwater quality and availability. As a result of our acquisition of Molycorp Silmet, our operations in Estonia are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of that country, including those applicable to European Union member countries. These requirements may result in significant costs, liabilities and obligations, impose conditions that are difficult to achieve or otherwise delay, limit or prohibit current or planned operations. Consequently, the modernization and expansion of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility may be delayed, limited or prevented and current operations may be curtailed. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other sanctions. Pursuant to such requirements, we may also be subject to third-party claims, including for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations. Moreover, these environmental requirements, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, GHG emission regulation is becoming more rigorous. As a result of our planned expansion at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, we expect to be required to report annual GHG emissions from our operations, and additional GHG emission related requirements are in various stages of development. The U.S. Congress is considering various legislative proposals to address climate change. In addition, the EPA 32Table of Contentshas issued regulations, including the “Tailoring Rule,” that subject GHG emissions from certain stationary sources to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. California is also implementing regulations pursuant to its Global Warming Solutions Act that establish a state-wide cap and trade program for GHG emissions. Any such regulations could require us to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase significantly our operating costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, reputation, operating performance and product demand. Any future changes in these laws, regulations or permits (or the interpretation or enforcement thereof) or any sanctions, damages, costs, obligations or liabilities in respect of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Molycorp Canada is subject to numerous and increasingly rigorous international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and permits affecting the mineral processing industry, including those pertaining to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air quality standards, GHG emissions, water usage and disposal, pollution, waste management, plant and wildlife protection, handling and disposal of radioactive substances, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and the discharge of materials into the environment. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, regulations and permits, Molycorp Canada may be subject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other liabilities, as well as for the investigation and remediation of soil, surface water, groundwater and other environmental media. Molycorp Canada's failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, and to obtain such permits could have a material adverse effect on Molycorp Canada's business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, Molycorp Canada is subject both to Chinese national and local environmental protection regulations that currently impose a graduated schedule of fees for the discharge of waste substances, require the payment of fines for discharges exceeding the standards, and provide for the closure of any facility which fails to comply with orders requiring it to cease or remedy certain activities causing environmental damage.We are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the California Labor Code and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, and various regulations applicable in Estonia, which impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations.Our operations at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, and the regulations adopted by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters.Our operations at our U.S. facilities are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.Our operations at the Molycorp Silmet facility are subject to the Estonian Health and Safety Act of 1999, and the health and safety requirements for handling hazardous chemicals and materials containing hazardous chemicals under Estonian law.Our failure to comply with these or other applicable safety and health standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.Our operations may affect the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, any of which could result in material costs, obligations or liabilities.Our operations currently use, and in the past have used, hazardous materials and generate, and in the past have generated, hazardous and naturally occurring radioactive wastes. Our Molycorp Silmet facility in Estonia has a long history of industrial use, including uranium ore and alum shale processing, as a result of which its operations may have impacted the environment. In addition, our Estonian operations require the management and disposal of radioactive wastes. Our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility has been used for mining and related purposes since 1952, and contamination is known to exist around the facility. We may be subject to claims under environmental laws, regulations and permits for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other liabilities, as well as for the investigation and remediation of soil, surface water, groundwater and other environmental media. Our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility is currently subject to an order issued by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board pursuant to which we have conducted various investigatory and remedial actions, primarily related to certain onsite impoundments, including groundwater monitoring, extraction and treatment and soil remediation. We are still in the process of delineating the extent of groundwater contamination at and around the facility and cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs relating to the remediation of such contamination. Also, prior to our acquisition of our Molycorp Mountain Pass 33Table of Contentsfacility, leaks in a wastewater pipeline from our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility to offsite evaporation ponds on the Ivanpah dry lake bed caused contamination. However, that contamination is being remediated by Chevron Mining Inc., who retained ownership of the ponds and the pipeline. In addition to claims arising out of our current or former properties, such claims may arise in connection with contaminated third-party sites at which we have disposed of waste. As a matter of law, and despite any contractual indemnity or allocation arrangements or acquisition agreements to the contrary, our liability for these claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of any contamination, or even for the entire share. These and similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as human exposure to hazardous or radioactive materials or wastes associated with our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.We may be unable to obtain, maintain or renew permits necessary for the development or operation of our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We must obtain, for all our operations, a number of permits that impose strict conditions, requirements and obligations relating to various environmental and health and safety matters in connection with our current and future operations, including the modernization and expansion of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. To obtain, maintain and renew certain permits, we may be required to conduct environmental studies and collect and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential impact of our current and future operations upon the environment, including the potential impact on endangered species, and to take steps to avoid or mitigate those impacts. The permitting rules, and interpretation thereof, are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. In some cases, the public (including environmental interest groups) has rights to comment upon and submit objections to permit applications and environmental analysis prepared in connection therewith, and otherwise participate in the permitting process, including challenging the issuance of permits, validity of environmental analyses and determinations and performance of permitted activities. Accordingly, permits required for our operations, including the modernization and expansion of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, may not be issued, maintained or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, may be issued or renewed with conditions that restrict our ability to conduct our operations economically, or may be subsequently revoked. Any such failure to obtain, maintain or renew permits, or other permitting delays or conditions, including in connection with any environmental impact analyses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are generally obligated to restore property after it has been mined in accordance with regulatory standards and our approved reclamation plan at our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. We are required under federal, state and local laws to maintain financial assurances, such as surety bonds, to secure such obligations. The failure to acquire, maintain or renew such assurances, as required by federal, state and local laws, could subject us to fines and penalties as well as the revocation of our operating permits. Such failure could result from a variety of factors, including: •the lack of availability, higher expense or unreasonable terms of such financial assurances; •the ability of current and future financial assurance counterparties to increase required collateral; and •the exercise by third-party financial assurance counterparties of any rights to refuse to renew the financial assurance instruments.Our inability to acquire or failure to maintain or renew such financial assurances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If the assumptions underlying our reclamation plan and mine closure obligations are inaccurate, we could be required to expend materially greater amounts than anticipated to reclaim mined property, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Federal, state and local laws and regulations establish reclamation and closure standards applicable to our surface mining and other operations as well. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine closure liabilities are based upon our closure and reclamation plans, third-party expert reports, current applicable laws and regulations, certain permit terms and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. Any change in the underlying assumptions or other variation between the estimated liabilities and actual costs could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.34Table of ContentsRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Mandatory Convertible Preferred StockA trading market that will provide our stockholders with adequate liquidity may not be sustained. Our common stock has been publicly traded since July 2010, and our mandatory convertible preferred stock since February 2011. The prices of our common and mandatory convertible preferred stock may fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.Our shares of common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, in July 2010, and our shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock, which we refer to as our preferred stock, began trading on the NYSE in February 2011. Active trading markets for our common stock and preferred stock may not be sustained, which could depress the market price of our common stock, preferred stock, or both, and could affect your ability to sell your shares of common stock or preferred stock. Limited trading volumes and liquidity may result in wide bid-ask spreads, contribute to significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock and our preferred stock and limit the number of investors who are able to buy our common stock and preferred stock.The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:• the extremely volatile rare earth industry;• our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;• loss of a large customer;• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;• general economic conditions;• the failure of securities analysts to cover our stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;• future sales of our common stock; and• other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section. Our common stock price has been particularly affected by the volatility in the rare earths industry, as the high and the low sales price of our common stock in the period since we went public in July 2010 through March 8, 2013 has ranged from a low of $5.75 to a high of $79.16. If conditions in our industry remain volatile, our common stock price may continue to exhibit volatility as well. In particular, if prices or demand for rare earth were to decline, our stock price would likely decline. The volatility of our preferred stock has been closely correlated to the volatility of our common stock from when we issued our preferred stock in February 2011 through March 8, 2013.Reports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our stock price and trading volume. Research analysts publish their own quarterly projections regarding our operating results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts' projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline.Future sales, or availability for sale, of shares of our common stock or preferred stock by stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock or preferred stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that large sales could occur, the exchange into shares of our common stock of the exchangeable shares issued by MCP Exchangeco Inc., a Canadian subsidiary of ours, or the conversion into shares of our common stock of shares of our preferred stock, our 3.25% Convertible 35Table of ContentsSenior Notes due 2016, our 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017, which we refer to together as the "existing convertible notes," the January 2013 convertible notes, or the perception that any such exchange or conversion could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, we had 138,773,538 shares of our common stock outstanding. All of these shares are freely tradable, except for any shares held by our "affiliates" as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Additionally, as of December 31, 2012, up to 4,140,000 and 37,721,274 shares of our common stock, subject, in each case, to anti-dilution, make-whole and other adjustments, will be issuable upon conversion of shares of the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the conversion of the existing convertible notes, respectively, and up to 167,007 shares of our common stock will be issuable upon exchange of the exchangeable shares (which are exchangeable for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis). Also, up to 23,958,336 shares of common stock, subject to anti-dilution, make-whole and other adjustments, will be issuable upon conversion of the January 2013 convertible notes. The common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock, the existing convertible notes or the January 2013 convertible notes will be freely tradeable. Certain holders of shares of common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of such shares of common stock. These registration rights are contained in a registration rights agreement entered into with the former members of Molycorp, LLC in connection with our Corporate Reorganization. Additionally, we are obligated to file a registration statement registering the sale from time to time of the 12,500,000 shares of common stock issued to Molymet, in connection with a securities purchase agreement, dated January 31, 2012, by and between Molycorp and Molymet.In addition, the 3,765,911 shares reserved for future issuance under our Molycorp, Inc. 2010 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as of December 31, 2012, will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.The availability of shares of our capital stock for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock and our preferred stock. In the future, we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our capital stock, including common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, or just our capital stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock and our preferred stock. In addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock or preferred stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock or preferred stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, in the foreseeable future.For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings, after considering any dividends on our preferred stock, to finance the development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon then-existing conditions, including our operating results and financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant. So long as any share of our preferred stock remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution may be declared or paid on our common stock unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends have been paid on our preferred stock, subject to exceptions, such as dividends on our common stock payable solely in shares of our common stock. Accordingly, holders of our common stock must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their shares of common stock.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation due to significant changes in the ownership of our common stock.As of December 31, 2012, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $85.4 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If certain transactions occur with respect to our capital stock that result in a cumulative ownership change of more than 50 percentage points by 5% stockholders over a three-year period as determined under rules prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations, annual limitations would be imposed with respect to our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and certain current deductions against any taxable income we achieve in future periods.Anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws after the Corporate Reorganization, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.36Table of ContentsOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquiror from making a tender offer for our shares or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Section 203 prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our board of directors, results in the stockholder holding more than 85% of our outstanding common stock or is approved by the holders of at least 662/3% of our outstanding common stock not held by the stockholder engaging in the transaction. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.Our Board can issue, without stockholder approval, additional preferred stock with voting and conversion rights and convertible debt that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock. Our Board can issue, without stockholder approval, additional preferred stock with voting and conversion rights and convertible debt that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock and reduce the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments or payments upon liquidation, including shares of our outstanding preferred stock and convertible senior notes. Such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock. The issuance of additional preferred stock and/or convertible debt or even the ability to issue additional preferred stock and/or convertible debt could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or other corporate action.Our preferred stock and convertible debt may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by our preferred stock and our convertible debt. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:•investors' anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock received upon conversion of our preferred stock and convertible debt;•possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our preferred stock and/or convertible debt as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and•hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our preferred stock and our common stock and convertible debt.We are required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls, particularly in a period of anticipated rapid growth, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act. Section 404 requires that we evaluate our internal control over financial reporting to enable management to report on the effectiveness of those controls. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have taken steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting and we have incurred significant costs to remediate identified deficiencies and improve our internal controls, and will incur additional expense as we undertake the modernization and expansion of the Molycorp Mountain Pass facility. As we implement this modernization and expansion, the resulting growth in our business will require us to implement additional internal controls. To comply with Sarbanes‑Oxley requirements, especially during this period of anticipated rapid growth, we will need to further upgrade our systems, including information technology, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting, finance and legal staff. If we are unable to upgrade our systems and procedures or hire the necessary 37Table of Contentsadditional personnel in a timely and effective fashion, we may not be able to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to public companies. As a public company, we are required to obtain an audit report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we or, to the extent applicable, our independent registered public accounting firm are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we fail to comply with our financial reporting requirements, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.38Table of ContentsITEM 1B.
