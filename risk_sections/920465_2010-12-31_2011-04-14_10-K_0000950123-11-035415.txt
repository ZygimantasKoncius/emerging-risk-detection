Risk Factors could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Our common stock is considered a penny stock and does not qualify for exemption from the penny stock restrictions, which may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares. Our common stock is classified as a penny stock by the SEC and is subject to rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. The SEC has adopted regulations which define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, these rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about current quotations for the securities and about commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative. Finally, broker-dealers must send monthly statements to purchasers of penny stocks disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. As a result of our shares of common stock being subject to the rules on penny stocks, the liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected. 11 Table of Contents Item 1B.
