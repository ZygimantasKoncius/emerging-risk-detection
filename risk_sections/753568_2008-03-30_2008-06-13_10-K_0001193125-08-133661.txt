ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS If we are unable to integrate, operate and manage the combined company resulting from our merger with Sipex, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the merger, which may adversely affect our financial results. Our merger with Sipex in August 2007 resulted in the combination of two previously independent public companies. Although we have achieved and expect to achieve additional benefits as a result of the merger, we may still face significant challenges to realize all expected benefits and synergies of the merger and there can be no assurance that we will realize all of the anticipated benefits. The integration of the companies has been and is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that can and may disrupt our business and divert our managements focus and resources from the day-to-day operation of the business. Integration challenges include, but are not limited to:  integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures and operations of the two companies;  retaining and assimilating the key personnel of each company; 16 Table of Contents  integrating sales, engineering, operations, marketing, information technology and business management;  retaining and maintaining relationships with existing customers, distributors and other partners of each company;  achieving expected enterprise synergies of the merger as rapidly as anticipated by us or financial or industry analysts;  integrating and managing multiple geographic locations;  integrating purchasing and procurement and retaining the main sources of supply and/or services of both companies;  integrating the business process and related information technology applications and infrastructure of the two companies;  developing new products and services that optimize the assets and resources of both companies;  coordinating research and development activities to enhance the timely development of new products and technologies; and  creating uniform standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting), procedures, policies and information systems. Meeting these challenges has involved and will continue to involve considerable risks, such as:  the potential disruption of each companys ongoing business and distraction of management;  the difficulty of fully leveraging acquired technology and intellectual property rights into our products;  potential unknown liabilities associated with the merger;  unanticipated expenses related to integration, including technical and operational integration; and  the impairment of relationships with employees, customers and channel partners such as Future, including potential changes in existing agreements or delay or deferral in decisions, as a result of the integration process. Combining businesses and operations of this magnitude and scope is challenging. We may not ultimately succeed in integrating Sipexs business into ours and we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of the merger. If we do not succeed in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with the merger, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our stock price is volatile. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly to date. In the future, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to:  loss of or changes to key executives;  our anticipated or actual operating results;  announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors;  technological innovations by us or our competitors;  product delays or setbacks by us, our customers or our competitors;  potential supply disruptions;  sales channel interruptions;  concentration of sales among a small number of customers; 17 Table of Contents  conditions in our customers markets and the semiconductor markets;  the commencement and/or results of litigation;  changes in estimates of our performance by securities analysts;  decreases in the value of our investments or long-lived assets, thereby requiring an asset impairment charge against earnings;  repurchasing shares of our common stock;  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions; and/or  general global economic and market conditions; In the past, securities and class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of one or more of these class action suits, which could result in significant costs and divert managements attention, thereby harming our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, at times the stock market has experienced and is currently experiencing extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices of many high technology companies, including semiconductor companies, and that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Any such fluctuations may harm the market price of our common stock. Our financial results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our financial results may fluctuate significantly. Some of the factors that affect our financial results, many of which are difficult or impossible to control or predict, are:  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry;  our difficulty in predicting revenues and ordering the correct mix of products from suppliers due to limited visibility provided by customers and channel partners;  fluctuations of our revenue and gross profits due to the mix of product sales that has various margins;  the effect of the timing of sales by our resellers on our reported results as a result of our sell-through revenue recognition policies;  the reduction, rescheduling, cancellation or timing of orders by our customers, distributors and channel partners due to, among others, the following factors:  management of customer, subcontractor and/or channel inventory;  delays in shipments from our subcontractors causing supply shortages;  inability of our subcontractors to provide quality products timely;  dependency on a single product with a single customer and/or distributors;  volatility of demand for equipment sold by our large customers, which in turn, introduces demand volatility for our products;  disruption in customer demand as customers change or modify their complex subcontract manufacturing supply chain;  disruption in customer demand due to technical or quality issues with our devices or components in their system;  the inability of our customers to obtain components from their other suppliers; and  disruption in sales or distribution channels; 18 Table of Contents  our ability to maintain and expand distributor relationships;  changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products;  the ability of our suppliers and customers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures;  risks associated with entering new markets;  the announcement or introduction of products by our existing competitors or potential new competitors;  loss of market share by our customers;  competitive pressures on selling prices or product availability;  pressures on selling prices overseas due to foreign currency exchange fluctuations;  erosion of average selling prices coupled with the inability to sell newer products with higher average selling prices, resulting in lower overall revenue and margins;  delays in product design life cycles;  market and/or customer acceptance of our products;  consolidation among our competitors, our customers and/or our customers customers;  changes in our customers end user concentration or requirements;  loss of one or more major customers;  significant changes in ordering pattern by major customers;  our or our channel partners ability to maintain and manage appropriate inventory levels;  the availability and cost of materials and services, including foundry, assembly and test capacity, needed by us from our foundries and suppliers;  disruptions in our or our customers supply chain due to natural disasters, fire, outbreak of communicable diseases, labor disputes, civil unrest or other reason;  delays in successful transfer of manufacturing process to our subcontractors;  fluctuations in the manufacturing output, yields, and capacity of our suppliers;  fluctuation in suppliers capacity due to reorganization, relocation or shift in business focus;  problems, costs, or delays that we may face in shifting our products to smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels of design and device integration;  our ability to successfully introduce and transfer into production new products and/or integrate new technologies;  increase in manufacturing costs;  higher mask tooling costs associated with advanced technologies;  the amount and timing of our investment in research and development;  costs and business disruptions associated with stockholder or regulatory issues;  the timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on our employees gains on stock options exercised;  inability to generate profits to utilize net operating loss;  increased costs and time associated with compliance with new accounting rules or new regulatory requirements; 19 Table of Contents  changes in accounting or other regulatory rules, such as the requirement to record assets and liabilities at fair value;  fluctuations in interest rates and/or market values of our marketable securities;  litigation costs associated with the defense of suits brought or complaints made against us; and  changes in or continuation of certain tax provisions. Our expense levels are based, in part, on expectations of future revenues and are, to a large extent, fixed in the short-term. Our future revenues are difficult to predict and at times we have failed to achieve revenue expectations. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. If revenue levels are below expectations for any reason, operating results are likely to be materially adversely affected. Because a significant portion of our total assets are represented by goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations, we could be required to write off some or all of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We accounted for our merger with Sipex using the purchase method of accounting. A portion of the purchase price for this business is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of consummation. The excess purchase price was allocated to goodwill. In accordance with the SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, for impairment. We conduct our annual analysis of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment in accordance with FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we conducted our annual impairment analysis of our goodwill and an impairment analysis of our long-lived assets, as our market capitalization was below its net book value for an extended period of time. We concluded that our carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the Sipex merger exceeded the implied fair value of these assets. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $165.2 million. There can be no assurance that when we perform future impairment tests, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets would not exceed the implied fair value and therefore additional adjustments may be required. Such adjustment would result in a charge to operating income in that period. A significant portion of our total assets are represented by goodwill and other intangible assets, which, in accordance with FAS 142, require an annual impairment review. Unlike other assets, goodwill cannot be defined as a stand-alone asset and must be valued as a residual of all other assets. The assessment of goodwill impairment is a subjective process. Estimations and assumptions regarding future performance, results of our operations and comparability of our market capitalization and its net book value will be used. Changes in estimates and assumptions could have adverse impact on our operating results and our effective tax rate. We have incurred additional costs associated with the Sipex merger and may continue to incur costs relating to the merger going forward. We have incurred additional costs associated with the merger. We may incur additional charges to operations in the quarters following the consummation of the merger associated with the integration. We anticipate that the combination of the two companies will continue to require future cash outflows for assumed Sipex liabilities and integration costs. If the benefits of the merger do not exceed the integration costs, our financial results may be adversely impacted. 20 Table of Contents We have made and in the future may make acquisitions and significant strategic equity investments, which may involve a number of risks. If we are unable to address these risks successfully, such acquisitions and investments could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have undertaken a number of strategic acquisitions and investments in the past, including our recent merger with Sipex, and may do so from time to time in the future. The risks involved with these acquisitions and investments include:  the possibility that we may not receive a favorable return on our investment or incur losses from our investment or the original investment may become impaired;  failure to satisfy or set effective strategic objectives;  our assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances; and  the diversion of managements attention from day-to-day operations of the business. Additional risks involved with acquisitions include:  difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired company or its assets;  difficulties in supporting acquired products or technologies;  difficulties or delays in the transfer of manufacturing flows and supply chains of products of acquired businesses;  failure to retain key personnel;  failure to retain customers and/or customer programs;  unexpected capital equipment outlays and related expenses;  difficulties in entering markets or retaining current markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions;  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;  under-performance problems with an acquired company;  issuance of common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership;  reduction in liquidity and interest income on lower cash balance;  recording of goodwill and intangible assets that will be subject to periodic impairment testing and potential impairment charges against our future earnings;  incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;  the opportunity cost associated with committing capital in such investments;  incurring large and immediate write-offs; and  being subject to litigation. Risks involved with strategic equity investments include:  the possibility of litigation resulting from these types of investments;  the possibility that we may not receive a financial return on our investments or incur losses from these investments;  a changed or poorly executed strategic plan; and  the opportunity cost associated with committing capital in such investments. 21 Table of Contents We may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems. Any delays or other such operations or financial problems could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are experiencing, and may continue to experience, unforeseen complications from the transfer of manufacturing processes to Hangzhou Silan Microelectronics Co. Ltd. and Hangzhou Silan Integrated Circuit Co. Ltd. (collectively Silan) in China and Episil Technologies Inc. (Episil) in Taiwan. Sipex transferred its manufacturing processes to foundries operated by Silan and Episil in conjunction with the closure of its Milpitas, California wafer fabrication facility. The transfer has been and continues to be a complicated and time-consuming process that has been met with significant unforeseen complications which has delayed the transfer and is requiring additional allocation of our resources. Additional unforeseen transferring or quality issues may arise in the future that could cause additional delays which could materially adversely impact our ability to timely produce our products to meet customer demand. In addition, the parties may be unable to achieve all or any of the expected benefits of the relationship within the anticipated time-frames. The anticipated synergies between us and Silan or Episil may not be as significant as originally expected. The manufacturing processes and wafer testing for certain products may not be qualified by us following the transfer from us to Silan or Episil, or the qualification process may take significantly longer than expected. This could result in additional operating costs, loss of customers and business disruptions. The complexity of our products may lead to errors, defects and bugs, which could subject us to significant costs or damages and adversely affect market acceptance of our products. Although we, our customers and our suppliers rigorously test our products, they may contain undetected errors, weaknesses, defects or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released. If any of our products contain production defects, reliability, quality or compatibility problems that are significant to our customers, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to continue to buy our products, which could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers. In addition, these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales of affected products, which could adversely affect our results of operations. If defects or bugs are discovered after commencement of commercial production, we may be required to make significant expenditures of capital and other resources to resolve the problems. This could result in significant additional development costs and the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts. We could also incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products or may agree to be liable for certain damages incurred. These costs or damages could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to develop, introduce or enhance products that meet evolving market needs or which are necessitated by technological advances, or we are unable to grow revenues, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. The markets for our products are characterized by a number of factors, some of which are listed below:  changing technologies;  evolving and competing industry standards;  changing customer requirements;  increasing price pressure;  increasing product development costs;  long design-to-production cycles;  competitive solutions; 22 Table of Contents  fluctuations in capital equipment spending levels and/or deployment;  rapid adjustments in customer demand and inventory;  increasing functional integration;  moderate to slow growth;  frequent product introductions and enhancements;  changing competitive landscape (consolidation, financial viability);  finite market windows for product introductions; and  short end market product life cycles. Our growth depends in part on our successful development and acceptance of new products for our core markets. We must: (i) anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards; (ii) properly define and develop new products on a timely basis; (iii) gain access to and use technologies in a cost-effective manner; (iv) have suppliers produce quality products; (v) continue to expand our technical and design expertise; (vi) introduce and cost-effectively manufacture new products on a timely basis; (vii) differentiate our products from our competitors offerings; and (viii) gain customer acceptance of our products. In addition, we must continue to have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers to define and develop new products that meet their evolving needs. Moreover, we must respond in a rapid and cost-effective manner to shifts in market demands, the trend towards increasing functional integration and other changes. Migration from older products to newer products may result in volatility of earnings. Products for our customers applications are based on continually evolving industry standards and new technologies. Our ability to compete will depend in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards. The emergence of new standards could render our products incompatible. We could be required to invest significant time, effort and expenses to develop and qualify new products to ensure compliance with industry standards. The process of developing and supporting new products is complex, expensive and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict and understand our customers changing needs and emerging technological trends, our business may be harmed. In addition, we may make significant investments to modify new products according to input from our customers who may choose a competitors or an internal solution, or cancel their projects. We may not be able to identify new product opportunities successfully, develop and bring to market new products, achieve design wins, ensure when and which design wins actually get released to production, or respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by our competitors. In addition, we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or may incorrectly anticipate market demand and develop products that achieve little or no market acceptance. Our pursuit of technological advances may require substantial time and expense and may ultimately prove unsuccessful. Failure in any of these areas may materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to convert a significant portion of our design wins into revenue, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. We have secured a significant number of design wins for new and existing products. Such design wins are necessary for revenue growth. However, many of our design wins may never generate revenues if their end-customer projects are unsuccessful in the market place or the end-customer terminates the project, which may occur for a variety of reasons. Mergers and consolidations among our customers may lead to termination of certain projects before the associated design win generates revenue. If design wins do generate revenue, the time lag between the design win and meaningful revenue is typically between six months to greater than eighteen months. If we fail to convert a significant portion of our design wins into substantial revenue, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. 23 Table of Contents If we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to efficiently manage our inventory. Due to the absence of substantial non-cancelable backlog, we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on customer forecasts, internal evaluation of customer demand and current backlog, which can fluctuate substantially. As a consequence of inaccuracies inherent in forecasting, inventory imbalances periodically occur that result in surplus amounts of some of our products and shortages of others. Such shortages can adversely impact customer relations and surpluses can result in larger-than-desired inventory levels, which can adversely impact our financial position. The general state of the U.S. and global economies, as well as our market, may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Periodic declines or fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar, corporate profits, lower spending, the impact of conflicts throughout the world, terrorist acts, natural disasters, volatile energy costs, the outbreak of communicable diseases and other geopolitical factors have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the U.S. and global economies. Our revenue and profitability have generally followed market fluctuations in our industry, which fluctuations have affected the demand for our own and our customers products, thus affecting our revenues and profitability. Our customers continue to experience consolidation in their industries which may result in project delays or cancellations. We are unable to predict the strength or duration of current market conditions or effects of consolidation. Uncertainties in anticipated spending levels or further consolidation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business may be adversely impacted if we fail to effectively utilize and incorporate acquired technology. We have acquired and may in the future acquire intellectual property to accelerate our time to market for new products. Acquisitions of intellectual property may involve risks such as successful technical integration into new products, market acceptance of new products and achievement of planned return on investment. Successful technical integration in particular requires a variety of factors which we may not currently have, such as available technical staff with sufficient time to devote to integration, the requisite skill sets to understand the acquired technology and the necessary support tools to effectively utilize the technology. The timely and efficient integration of acquired technology may be adversely impacted by inherent design deficiencies or application requirements. The potential failure of or delay in product introduction utilizing acquired intellectual property could lead to an impairment of capitalized intellectual property acquisition costs. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, we will experience fewer customer orders, reduced revenues, reduced gross margins and lost market share. We compete in markets that are intensely competitive, and which are subject to both rapid technological change and continued price erosion. Our competitors include many large domestic and foreign companies that have substantially greater financial, technical and management resources and leverage than we have. We have experienced increased competition at the design stage, where customers evaluate alternative solutions based on a number of factors, including price, performance, product features, technologies, and availability of long-term product supply and/or roadmap guarantee. Additionally, we experience, in some cases, severe pressure on pricing from some of our competitors or on-going cost reduction expectations from customers. Such circumstances may make some of our products unattractive due to price or performance measures and result in losing our design opportunities or causing a decrease in our revenue and margins. Also, competition from new companies in emerging economy countries with significantly lower costs could affect our selling price and gross margins. In addition, if competitors in Asia reduce prices on commodity products, it would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in that region. Specifically, we have licensed rights to Silan to market our commodity interface products that could reduce our sales in the future. Loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced revenues, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, 24 Table of Contents any of which would affect our operating results and financial condition. To remain competitive, we continue to evaluate our manufacturing operations, looking for additional cost savings and technological improvements. If we are unable to successfully implement new process technologies and to achieve volume production of new products at acceptable yields, our operating results and financial condition may be affected. Our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:  increase device performance and improve manufacturing yields;  accurately identify emerging technological trends and demand for product features and performance characteristics;  develop and maintain competitive products;  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors;  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices;  respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others;  adapt products and processes to technological changes;  adopt or set emerging industry standards; and  meet changing customer requirements. There can be no assurance that our design, development and introduction schedules for new products or enhancements to our existing and future products will be met. In addition, there can be no assurance that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable. If our distributors or sales representatives stop selling or fail to successfully promote our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. We sell many of our products through sales representatives and distributors, many of which sell directly to OEMs, contract manufacturers and end customers. Our non-exclusive distributors and sales representatives may carry our competitors products, which could adversely impact or limit sales of our products. Additionally, they could reduce or discontinue sales of our products or may not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect. Our agreements with distributors contain limited provisions for return of our products, including stock rotations whereby distributors may return a percentage of their purchases from us based upon a percentage of their most recent three months of shipments. In addition, in certain circumstances upon termination of the distributor relationship, distributors may return some portion of their prior purchases. The loss of business from any of our significant distributors or the delay of significant orders from any of them, even if only temporary, could materially and adversely harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Moreover, we depend on the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales representatives, some of which are small organizations with limited working capital. In turn, these distributors and sales representatives are subject to general economic and semiconductor industry conditions. We believe that our success will continue to depend on these distributors and sales representatives. If some or all of our distributors and sales representatives experience financial difficulties, or otherwise become unable or unwilling to promote and sell our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 25 Table of Contents We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our two primary distributors, Future, a related party, and Nu Horizons. Our revenues would likely decline significantly if our primary distributors elected not to promote or sell our products or if they elected to cancel, reduce or defer purchases of our products. Future and Nu Horizons have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, and they are our two primary distributors worldwide. We anticipate that sales of our products to these distributors will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of Future and Nu Horizons as distributors, or a significant reduction in orders from them would materially and adversely affect our operating results, business and financial condition. Sales to Future and Nu Horizons are made under agreements that provide protection against price reduction for their inventory of our products. As such, we could be exposed to significant liability if the inventory value of the products held by Future and Nu Horizons declined dramatically. Our distributor agreements with Future and Nu Horizons do not contain minimum purchase commitments. As a result, Future and Nu Horizons could cease purchasing our products with short notice or cease distributing these products. In addition, they may defer or cancel orders without penalty, which would likely cause our revenues to decline and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Affiliates of Future, Alonim Investments Inc. and its two affiliates (collectively Alonim), own approximately 18% of our common stock, and as such, Alonim is our largest stockholder. This ownership position will allow Future to significantly influence matters requiring stockholders approval. Futures ownership will continue to increase as a percentage of our outstanding stocks if we continue to repurchase our common stock. In addition, an executive officer of Future is on our board of directors, which could lead to actual or imputed influence from Future. As a result of our merger with Sipex, an affiliate of Future, our largest distributor, owns a significant percentage of our outstanding shares and Pierre Guilbault, the chief financial officer of Future, is a member of our board of directors. Due to its affiliates ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock, Future may be able to exert strong influence over, actions requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of directors, many types of change of control transactions and amendments to our charter documents, although Future is bound by a Lock-Up and Standstill Agreement until August 25, 2009, prohibiting Future from either soliciting proxies or seeking to advise anyone with respect to voting our stock. The significant ownership percentage of Future could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from obtaining control of us. Conversely, by virtue of Futures percentage ownership of our stock, Future could facilitate a takeover transaction that our board of directors did not approve, although, by the terms of the same Lock-Up and Standstill Agreement, Future is prohibited from making any public announcements with respect to, or proposing, any extraordinary transaction involving us until the first anniversary of the merger date. This relationship could also result in actual or imputed attempts to influence management to take actions beneficial to Future which may or may not be beneficial to us or in our best interests. Future could attempt to obtain terms and conditions more favorable than those we would typically provide our distributors because of its relationship with us. Any such actual or perceived preferential treatment could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on third-party foundries to manufacture our products. Any disruption in or loss of the foundries capacity to manufacture our products subjects us to a number of risks, which include the potential for an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs. These risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility or a foundry. We utilize various foundries for different processes. Our products are based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), Bipolar processes and Bipolar-CMOS (BiCMOS) process. Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd., or Chartered, 26 Table of Contents located in Singapore, manufactures the majority of the CMOS wafers from which our communications and UART products are produced. Episil, located in Taiwan, and Silan, located in China, manufacture the majority of wafers from which our power and serial products are produced. High Voltage BiCMOS power products are supplied by Polar Semiconductor (MN, USA) and Jazz Semiconductor (CA, USA). All of these foundries produce semiconductors for many other companies (many of which have greater requirements than us), and therefore, we may not have access on a timely basis to sufficient capacity or certain process technologies. In addition, we rely on our foundries continued financial health and ability to continue to invest in smaller geometry manufacturing processes and additional wafer processing capacity. The manufacturing processes for our products are highly complex and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance. Many of our new products are designed to take advantage of smaller geometry manufacturing processes. Due to the complexity and increased cost of migrating to smaller geometries as well as process changes, we could experience interruptions in production or significantly reduced yields causing product introduction or delivery delays. If such delays occur, our products may have delayed market acceptance or customers may select our competitors products during the design process. In addition, yields can be adversely affected by minute impurities in the environment or other problems that occur in the complex manufacturing process. Many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and are time-consuming or expensive to remedy. In particular, new process technologies or new products can be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency. There can be no assurance that our foundries or the foundries of our suppliers will not experience unfavorable yield variances or other manufacturing problems that result in delayed product introduction or delivery delays. This risk is particularly significant in the near term as we have recently transferred certain of our manufacturing processes to Silan and Episil. We do not have long-term wafer supply agreements with Chartered that would guarantee wafer quantities, prices, and delivery or lead times, but we do provide minimum purchase commitments to Silan and Episil in accordance with our supply agreements. Subject to any such minimum purchase commitments, these foundries manufacture our products on a purchase order basis. We provide Chartered and our other foundries with rolling forecasts of our production requirements. However, the ability of our foundries to provide wafers is limited by the foundries available capacity. There can be no assurance that our third-party foundries will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy our requirements. Furthermore, any sudden reduction or elimination of any primary source or sources of fully processed wafers could result in a material delay in the shipment of our products. Any delays or shortages will materially and adversely impact our business, financial conditions and operating results. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will continue to do business with our foundries on terms as favorable as our current terms. Significant risks associated with our reliance on third-party foundries include:  the lack of assured process technology and wafer supply;  limited control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;  financial and operating stability of the foundries;  limited control over delivery schedules;  limited manufacturing capacity of the foundries; and  potential misappropriation of our intellectual property. We could experience a substantial delay or interruption in the shipment of our products or an increase in our costs due to any of the following:  a manufacturing disruption experienced by foundries utilized by us or sudden reduction or elimination of any existing source or sources of semiconductor manufacturing materials or processes, which might include the potential closure, change of ownership, change of management or consolidation by one of our foundries; 27 Table of Contents  extended time required to identify, qualify and transfer to alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products;  failure of our foundries to obtain raw materials and equipment;  financial and operating stability of the foundries or any of their suppliers;  acts of terrorism or civil unrest or an unanticipated disruption due to communicable diseases, political instability or natural disasters;  a sudden, sharp increase in demand for semiconductor devices, which could strain the foundries manufacturing resources and cause delays in manufacturing and shipment of our products; and  manufacturing quality control or process control issues. To secure foundry capacity, we may be required to enter into financial and other arrangements with foundries, which could result in the dilution of our earnings or otherwise harm our operating results. Allocation of a foundrys manufacturing capacity may be influenced by a foundry customers size, the existence of a long-term agreement with the foundry or other commitments. To address foundry capacity constraints, we and other semiconductor companies that rely on third-party foundries have utilized various arrangements, including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange for guaranteed production capacity, joint ventures to own and operate foundries or take or pay contracts that commit a company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods. These arrangements may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Any of these arrangements could require us to commit substantial capital and, accordingly, could require us to reduce our cash holdings, incur additional debt or secure equity financing. This could result in the dilution of our earnings or the ownership of our stockholders or otherwise harm our operating results. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain sufficient foundry capacity in the future pursuant to such arrangements. If our foundries discontinue or limit the availability of the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands or are unable to provide the technologies needed to manufacture our products, we may face production delays or be forced to terminate affected products, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our wafer requirements represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture our products. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a foundry may cease production of a wafer fabrication process required by us. Additionally, we cannot be certain that our foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based. Each of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time, or force us to terminate affected products, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our dependence on third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks, including the potential for an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs. These risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on independent subcontractors in Asia for all of the assembly and the majority of the testing and shipping of our products to end customers. Our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following risks:  our reduced control over manufacturing yields, production schedules and product quality;  the potential closure, change of ownership, change in business conditions or relationships, change of management or consolidation by one or more of our subcontractors;  possible unavailability of qualified assembly or test services; 28 Table of Contents  the subcontractors may cease production on a specific package type used to assemble product required by us and the possible inability to obtain an alternate source to supply the package;  potential increases in assembly and test costs;  long-term financial stability of our subcontractors and their ability to invest in new capabilities and/or expand capacity to meet increasing demand;  disruption of services due to the outbreak of communicable diseases, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, labor disputes or civil unrest;  disruption of manufacturing or test services due to relocation of subcontractor manufacturing facilities;  subcontractors imposing higher minimum order quantities for substrates;  failure of our subcontractors to obtain raw materials and equipment;  increasing cost of raw materials resulting in higher package costs;  entry into take-or-pay agreements;  additional costs to qualify new local assembly subcontractors for prototypes;  difficulties in selecting, qualifying and integrating new subcontractors;  reallocation or limited manufacturing capacity of the subcontractors;  a sudden, sharp increase in demand for semiconductor devices, which could strain our subcontractors manufacturing resources and cause delays in manufacturing and shipment of our products;  limited warranties from our subcontractors for products assembled and tested for us; and  third-party subcontractors abilities to transition to smaller package types and to new package compositions. These risks may lead to shipment delays and supply constraints of our products or increased cost for the finished products, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to meet current demand or any increase in demand for our products may be limited by our ability to test our semiconductor wafers. As part of our manufacturing process, we must test many of our semiconductor wafers using certain probe testing equipment. As such, our ability to meet current demand or any increase in demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to purchase and install sufficient testing equipment. Obtaining and installing this equipment is a time and capital intensive process and depends on our ability to accurately predict future sales. If we are unable to estimate future sales correctly or we are unable to obtain the necessary testing equipment on a timely basis, we may be unable to meet the current demand or any increased demand for our products. Our reliance on foreign suppliers exposes us to risks associated with international operations, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We use semiconductor wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors throughout Asia to manufacture a significant portion of our products. Our dependence on these subcontractors involves the following risks:  disruption of services due to political, civil, labor and economic instability;  disruption of services due to natural disasters or outbreak of communicable diseases;  disruption of transportation to and from Asia; 29 Table of Contents  embargoes or other regulatory limitations affecting the availability of raw materials, equipment or changes in tax laws, tariffs, services and freight rates; and  compliance with local or international regulatory requirements. These risks may lead to delays in product delivery or increased costs, either of which could harm our profitability and customer relationships, thereby materially and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend in part on the continued service of our key engineering and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, incentivize and retain qualified personnel. If we lose key employees or fail to identify, hire, incentivize and retain these individuals, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Our future success depends, in part, on the continued service of our key design engineering, technical, sales, marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify, hire, incentivize and retain other qualified personnel. The success of the merger will depend in part on the retention of personnel critical to the business and operations of the combined company due to, for example, their technical skills or management expertise. Current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us. In addition, competitors may recruit employees during our integration, as is common in high technology mergers. If we are unable to retain personnel that are critical to successful integration and our future operations, we could face disruptions in operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs. In the future, we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel necessary for the management of our business. Competition for skilled employees having specialized technical capabilities and industry-specific expertise is intense and continues to be a considerable risk inherent in the markets in which we compete. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the ability to offer equity compensation to as many key employees or in amounts consistent with past practices, as a result of regulations regarding the expensing of equity awards, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, all of whom have been granted equity awards. Our employees are employed at-will, which means that they can terminate their employment at any time. The failure to retain and recruit, as necessary, key design engineers, technical, sales, marketing and executive personnel could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimations and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in rulemaking by the regulatory bodies; and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly impact our results of operations. Our change in the revenue recognition used for sales to our two primary distributors from sell-in to sell-through basis has impacted our financial results as revenues and costs which had been recognized upon sell-in to these distributors are now deferred until these two distributors sell-through to their customers. The delay in revenue recognition has unfavorably affected our current period operating results. 30 Table of Contents The final determination of our income tax liability may be materially different from our income tax provision, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:  the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with mergers;  changes in available tax credits;  changes in share-based compensation expense;  changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and/or  the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. In addition, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if these assessments or any other assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the IRS or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. We acquired significant net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards as a result of the Sipex merger. The utilization of acquired NOL carryforwards is subject to IRSs complex limitation rules that carry significant burdens of proof. The eventual ability to utilize our estimated NOL carryforwards is subject to IRS scrutiny and our future results may not benefit as a result of potential unfavorable IRS rulings. Our engagement with foreign customers could cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. International sales have accounted for, and will likely continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues, which subjects us to the following risks:  changes in regulatory requirements;  tariffs and other barriers;  timing and availability of export or import licenses;  disruption of services due to political, civil, labor, and economic instability;  disruption of services due to natural disasters outside the United States;  disruptions to customer operations outside the United States due to the outbreak of communicable diseases;  difficulties in accounts receivable collections;  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations;  difficulties in managing sales channel partners;  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for communications and other products; 31 Table of Contents  limited intellectual property protection;  foreign currency exchange fluctuations;  the burden of complying with foreign laws and treaties; and  potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, because sales of our products have been denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared with local currencies could make our products more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country resulting in pricing pressures on our products. Increased international activity in the future may result in foreign currency denominated sales. Furthermore, because some of our customers purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws, we may be limited in our ability, or it may be too costly for us, to enforce our rights under these agreements and to collect damages, if awarded. Because some of our integrated circuits products have lengthy sales cycles, we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to product development and the revenue derived from these products. A portion of our revenue is derived from selling integrated circuits to communications equipment vendors. Due to their product development cycle, we have typically experienced at least an eighteen-month time lapse between our initial contact with a customer and realizing volume shipments. We first work with customers to achieve a design win, which may take nine months or longer. Our customers then complete their design, test and evaluation process and begin to ramp-up production, a period which typically lasts an additional nine months. The customers of communications equipment manufacturers may also require a period of time for testing and evaluation, which may cause further delays. As a result, a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue, if any, from volume purchasing of our communications products by our customers. Due to the length of the communications equipment vendors product development cycle, the risks of project cancellation by our customers, price erosion or volume reduction are present for an extended period of time. Our backlog may not result in revenue. Due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules and quantities actually purchased, cancellation of orders, distributor returns or price reductions, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. We may not be able to meet our expected revenue levels or results of operations if there is a reduction in our order backlog during any particular period and we are unable to replace those sales during the same period. Fixed operating expenses and our practice of ordering materials in anticipation of projected customer demand could make it difficult for us to respond effectively to sudden swings in demand and result in higher than expected costs and excess inventory. Such sudden swings in demand could therefore have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short to medium term, and therefore, we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly and sufficiently in response to any revenue shortfall. In addition, we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. From time to time, in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside suppliers and foundries, we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand. This advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write-downs if expected orders fail to materialize. This incremental cost could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 32 Table of Contents We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, which could harm our competitive position. Our ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, mask work registrations, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and non-disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these efforts, we may be unable to protect our proprietary information. Such intellectual property rights may not be recognized or if recognized, it may not be commercially feasible to enforce. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our competitors will not independently develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to our technology. More specifically, our pending patent applications or any future applications may not be approved, and any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. If challenged, our patents may be found to be invalid or unenforceable, and the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar products or processes, duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us. We could be required to pay substantial damages or could be subject to various equitable remedies if it were proven that we infringed the intellectual property rights of others. As a general matter, the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. If a third party were to prove that our technology infringed its intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages for past infringement and could be required to pay license fees or royalties on future sales of our products. If we were required to pay such license fees whenever we sold our products, such fees could exceed our revenue. In addition, if it were proven that we willfully infringed a third partys proprietary rights, we could be held liable for three times the amount of the damages that we would otherwise have to pay. Such intellectual property litigation could also require us to:  stop selling, incorporating or using our products that use the infringed intellectual property;  obtain a license to make, sell or use the relevant technology from the owner of the infringed intellectual property, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; and/or  redesign our products so as not to use the infringed intellectual property, which may not be technically or commercially feasible. The defense of infringement claims and lawsuits, regardless of their outcome, would likely be expensive and could require a significant portion of managements time. In addition, rather than litigating an infringement matter, we may determine that it is in our best interests to settle the matter. Terms of a settlement may include the payment of damages and our agreement to license technology in exchange for a license fee and ongoing royalties. These fees could be substantial. If we were required to pay damages or otherwise became subject to such equitable remedies, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. Similarly, if we were required to pay license fees to third parties based on a successful infringement claim brought against us, such fees could exceed our revenue. Occasionally, we enter into agreements that expose us to potential damages that exceed the value of the agreement. We have given certain customers increased indemnification for product deficiencies that is in excess of the standard limited warranty indemnification and could possibly result in greater costs, in excess of the original contract value. In an attempt to limit this liability, we have also increased our errors and omissions insurance policy to partially offset these potential additional costs; however, our insurance coverage could be insufficient to prevent us from suffering material losses if the indemnification amounts are large enough. 33 Table of Contents Earthquakes and other natural disasters may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers and customers. Our corporate headquarters in Fremont, California is located near major earthquake faults that have experienced seismic activity. In addition, some of our customers and suppliers are in locations which may be subject to similar natural disasters. In the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters, our operations could be disrupted. Similarly, a major earthquake or other natural disaster affecting one or more of our major customers or suppliers could adversely impact the operations of those affected, which could disrupt the supply of our products and harm our business.
