Sony plans to invest 160.0 billion yen in semiconductor fabrication facilities and equipment. This investment includes investment in the production capacity for chips used for PLAYSTATION 3, LCD televisions, LCD rear projection televisions, and mobile products. In addition to the facilities above, Sony has a number of other plants for electronic products throughout the world. Sony owns research and development facilities and employee housing and recreation facilities, as well as Sony Corporations headquarters buildings in Tokyo, Japan, where administrative functions and product development activities are carried out. SCEI leases its corporate headquarters buildings located in Tokyo, where administrative functions, product development, and software development are carried out. SCEA and SCEE lease their offices in the U.S. and Europe, respectively. Most of SMEJs offices, including leased premises, are located in Tokyo, Japan. SPEs corporate offices and motion picture and television production facilities are headquartered in Culver City, California, where it owns and operates a studio facility, Sony Pictures Studios. A second studio facility, The Culver Studios, which was owned and operated by SPE was sold by SPE in April 2004. SPE is leasing back a portion of this facility for a two-year period. SPE also leases office space and motion picture and television support facilities from affiliates of Sony Corporation and other third parties in various worldwide locations. SPEs film and videotape storage operations are located in various leased locations in the U.S. and Europe. In December 2001, SCA entered into a lease for its corporate headquarters. The aggregate floor space of this building is approximately 723,000 square feet. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects OPERATING RESULTS Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2005 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2004 Overview After translation of Sonys financial results into yen (the currency in which Sonys financial statements are prepared), in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). Sonys sales and operating revenue (sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased 4.5 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. On a local currency basis (regarding references to results of operations expressed on a local currency basis, refer to Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging below), sales for the fiscal year decreased approximately 3 percent. This decrease is mainly due to the fact that, as of August 1, 2004, the sales of Sonys overseas recorded music business are no longer recorded within Sonys consolidated sales as a result of the establishment of SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT (SONY BMG), which is accounted for by the equity method, through the merger of Sonys overseas recorded music business with Bertelsmann AGs recorded music business, and a change in the method of recognizing insurance premiums received on certain products at Sony Life, as of the third quarter beginning October 1, 2003, from being recorded as revenues to being offset against the related provision for future insurance policy benefits. Operating income increased 15.2 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. On a local currency basis, operating income increased approximately 26 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. In addition to a decrease in restructuring charges compared to the previous fiscal year, several segments experienced an improvement in profitability such as the Pictures segment, where Spider-Man 2 was a significant contributor, and the Music segment, where several best-selling albums and singles in Japan contributed to improved profitability. On the other hand, the Electronics segment, where the cost of sales ratio deteriorated due to pricing pressures, and the Game segment, where there was a decrease in hardware sales, both experienced deteriorated profitability. 28 Table of Contents Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 90.0 billion yen, a decrease from the 168.1 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The primary restructuring activities were in the Electronics and Music segments. Of the total 90.0 billion yen, Sony recorded 53.6 billion yen in personnel related costs. This expense was incurred because 12,000 people, mainly in Japan, the U.S. and Western Europe, left the company primarily through early retirement programs. For more detailed information about restructuring, please refer to Note 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Electronics Restructuring charges in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were 81.8 billion yen, compared to 143.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Of these restructuring charges, restructuring charges of 2.1 billion yen and 1.1 billion yen, for the years ended March 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, were recorded in the non-Japan based disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses, formerly included within the Music segment but reclassified to the Electronics segment. See Note 24 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this reclassification. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Sony made a decision to shut down certain TV display CRT manufacturing operations in Japan to rationalize production facilities and downsize its business, due to a contraction in the market as a result of a shift in demand from CRT televisions to plasma and liquid crystal display (LCD) panel televisions. In the year ended March 31, 2005, as part of this restructuring program, Sony recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 7.5 billion yen for the CRT TV display manufacturing facilities located in Europe. The impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The charge was recorded in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the consolidated statements of income. In addition to the above restructuring efforts, Sony undertook several headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs in the Electronics segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 50.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, and these charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. These staff reductions were achieved worldwide mostly through the implementation of early retirement programs. The remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2005 was 14.0 billion yen and will be paid through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006. Sony will continue seeking the appropriate headcount level to optimize the workforce in the Electronics segment. Music Restructuring charges in the Music segment, including at Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. (SMEJ), for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were 3.8 billion yen, compared to 9.9 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Due to the continued contraction of the worldwide music market caused by slow worldwide economic growth, the saturation of the CD market, the effects of piracy and other illegal duplication, parallel imports, pricing pressures and the diversification of customer preferences, Sony has been actively repositioning the Music segment for the future by looking to create a more effective and profitable business model. As a result, the Music segment has undertaken a worldwide restructuring program since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 to reduce staffing and other costs through the consolidation and rationalization of facilities worldwide. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, in continuation of the worldwide restructuring program and in connection with the merger of its recorded music business into a joint venture with Bertelsmann AG, Sony recorded restructuring charges totaling 3.0 billion yen within the Music segment. These restructuring charges exclude restructuring charges that were recorded in the non-Japan based disc manufacturing and physical 29 Table of Contents distribution businesses that were formerly included in the Music segment but have now been reclassified to the Electronics segment. Restructuring activities included the shutdown of certain distribution operations after the establishment of the recorded music joint venture with Bertelsmann AG as well as the further rationalization of overhead functions through staff reductions. The restructuring charges consisted of personnel related costs of 0.9 billion yen and other related costs of 2.1 billion yen. These charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Positions were eliminated across various employee levels, business functions, operating units, and geographic regions during this phase of the worldwide restructuring program. Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,496.4 7,159.6 -4.5 % Operating income 98.9 113.9 +15.2 Income before income taxes 144.1 157.2 +9.1 Equity in net income of affiliated companies 1.7 29.0 +1,594.2 Net income 88.5 163.8 +85.1 Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 336.8 billion yen, or 4.5 percent, to 7,159.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Sales in this analysis of the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue, and excludes Financial service revenue. This is because Financial Service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Furthermore, in the analysis of cost of sales, including research and development costs, to sales, only net sales are used. This is because cost of sales is an expense associated only with net sales. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 58.1 billion yen, or 1.1 percent, to 5,000.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, but increased from 73.5 percent to 76.2 percent as a percentage of sales. Year on year, the cost of sales ratio rose from 78.9 percent to 81.8 percent in the Electronics segment and increased from 70.1 percent to 73.0 percent in the Game segment. On the other hand, the cost of sales ratio decreased from 58.5 percent to 57.2 percent in the Music segment and improved in the Pictures segment from 60.0 percent to 58.7 percent. In the Electronics segment, there was a deterioration in the cost of sales ratio particularly within the CRT television, portable audio, DVD recorder (including PSX) and video camera businesses. In the Game segment, there was an increase in the cost of sales ratio as a result of costs associated with both the launch of the PlayStation Portable and the changeover to the new PlayStation 2 (PS2) model. The cost of sales ratio in the Music segment improved due to the establishment of SONY BMG which is accounted for under the equity method resulting in a higher percentage of sales being derived from SMEJ which benefited from the contribution of greatest hits album sales. In the Pictures segment, the cost of sales ratio also improved primarily due to the substantial contribution from Spider-Man 2. Personnel related costs included in cost of sales decreased by 52.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, primarily within the Electronics segment. 30 Table of Contents Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 12.5 billion yen to 502.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 7.6 percent compared to 7.5 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 263.2 billion yen, or 14.6 percent, to 1,535.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales improved from 25.9 percent in the previous fiscal year to 23.2 percent. Year on year, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales improved from 21.2 percent to 19.0 percent in the Electronics segment, from 21.1 percent to 21.0 percent in the Game segment, and improved from 41.8 percent to 38.9 percent in the Music segment, and from 35.0 percent to 32.5 percent in the Pictures segment. Personnel related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 169.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in severance related expenses in the Electronics segment resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives, and the fact that personnel related costs in Sonys recorded music business outside Japan are no longer recorded within Sonys consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses due to the establishment of SONY BMG mentioned above. In addition, advertising and publicity expenses for the fiscal year decreased by 51.6 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to the fact that advertising and publicity expenses that were recorded in the Music segment decreased due to the establishment of SONY BMG and a reduction in advertising and publicity expenses in the Pictures segment. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 28.0 billion yen, compared with 35.5 billion in the previous fiscal year. Although losses were recorded on the sale, disposal and impairment of CRT and CRT television production equipment in the Electronics segment, gains were recorded mainly from the sale of land and buildings in both the Electronics and Other segments. Operating Income Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased by 15.0 billion yen, or 15.2 percent, to 113.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating income margin increased from 1.3 percent to 1.6 percent. The business segments that contributed the most to operating income, in descending order by amount of financial impact, were the Pictures, Financial Services and Game segments. On the other hand, the Electronics segment recorded an operating loss mainly due to the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar as well as an increase in cost of sales that exceeded the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. For a further breakdown of operating income for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses In the consolidated results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, other income decreased by 24.7 billion yen, or 20.2 percent, to 97.6 billion yen, while other expenses decreased by 22.8 billion yen, or 29.5 percent, to 54.3 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 43.3 billion yen, a decrease of 1.9 billion yen, or 4.2 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. A net foreign exchange loss of 0.5 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, compared to a net foreign exchange gain of 18.1 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The net foreign exchange loss was recorded because the value of the yen, especially during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, was lower than the value of the yen at the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts are entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. 31 Table of Contents For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, a loss on devaluation of securities investments of 3.7 billion yen was recorded, an improvement of 12.8 billion yen, or 77.5 percent, compared with the previous year. This improvement was primarily due to the recording of valuation losses of 10.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year related to securities issued by a privately held Japanese company engaged in cable broadcasting and other businesses which Sony accounted for under the cost method. The gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees increased by 11.5 billion yen, or 235.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year to 16.3 billion yen. This was mainly the result of gains of 9.0 billion yen from a change in interest from Monex Inc., an equity affiliate of Sony, following its business integration by way of share transfer with Nikko Beans, Inc and total gains of 4.7 billion yen from the sale of stock and a change in interest in a subsidiary resulting from the initial public offering of So-net M3 Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of Sony Communication Network Corporation. In addition, the net gain recorded on sales of securities investments decreased 6.3 billion yen, or 53.8 percent, to 5.4 billion yen. This was primarily a result of the recording of a deferred gain of 6.0 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, from Sonys sale, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, of its equity interest in Telemundo Communications Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Telemundo), a U.S.-based Spanish language television network and station group that was accounted for under the equity method. Income before Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased 13.1 billion yen, or 9.1 percent, to 157.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, as a result of the increase in operating income and the decrease in net amount of other income and other expenses mentioned above. Income Taxes Income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 36.7 billion yen, or 69.6 percent, to 16.0 billion yen. Compared to an effective tax rate of 36.6 percent in the previous fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 10.2 percent in the current fiscal year. As a result of the recording of operating losses in the past, the U.S. subsidiaries of Sony have had valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for U.S. federal taxes and certain state taxes. However, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, based on both improved operating results in recent years and a sound outlook for the future operating performance at Sonys U.S. subsidiaries, Sony reversed 67.9 billion yen of such valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction to income tax expense. On the other hand, certain of Sonys subsidiaries recorded new valuation allowances against deferred tax assets during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method Equity in net income of affiliated companies during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was 29.0 billion yen, an increase of 27.3 billion yen, or 1,594.2 percent, compared to 1.7 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson), a joint venture focused on mobile phone handsets, was 17.4 billion yen, an increase of 11.0 billion yen, or 171.9 percent, compared to the 6.4 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of affiliated companies for the current fiscal year includes the recording of 12.6 billion yen as equity in net income from InterTrust Technologies Corporation (InterTrust). This amount reflects InterTrusts proceeds from a license agreement with Microsoft Corporation arising from the settlement of a patent-related lawsuit. In addition, due to significant restructuring costs, an equity loss of 3.4 billion yen was recorded at SONY BMG. Furthermore, equity in net loss was recorded at affiliates such as Star Channel Inc., a Japan-based subscription television company specializing in the broadcast of movies, and S-LCD Corporation (S-LCD), a joint-venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the manufacture of amorphous TFT LCD panels. Minority Interest in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased by 0.7 billion yen, or 30.6 percent, to 1.7 billion yen. This decrease was primarily due to the 32 Table of Contents recording of minority interest at certain television and home entertainment subsidiaries in the Pictures segment in the previous fiscal year. Net Income Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased by 75.3 billion yen, or 85.1 percent, to 163.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This increase was the result primarily of the abovementioned increase in income before income taxes, a decrease in the effective tax rate, as well as an increase in equity in net income of affiliated companies. As a percentage of sales, net income increased from 1.2 percent to 2.3 percent. Return on stockholders equity increased from 3.8 percent to 6.2 percent. (This ratio is calculated by dividing net income by the simple average of stockholders equity at the end of the previous fiscal year and at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.) Basic net income per share was 175.90 yen compared with 95.97 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net income per share was 158.07 yen compared with 87.00 yen in the previous fiscal year. Refer to Notes 2 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The newly formed company, SONY BMG, is 50 percent owned by each parent company. Under U.S. GAAP, SONY BMG is accounted for by Sony using the equity method and, since August 1, 2004, 50 percent of net profits or losses of this business have been included under equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies. In connection with the establishment of this joint venture, Sonys non-Japan based disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses, formerly included within the Music segment, have been reclassified to the Electronics segment to reflect the new management reporting structure whereby Sonys Electronics segment has now assumed responsibility for these businesses. Results for the previous fiscal year in the Electronics and Music segments have been restated to account for this reclassification. In the Music segment, results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 only include the results of Sony Music Entertainment Inc.s (SMEI) recorded music business for the months of April through July 2004, and the twelve months results of SMEIs music publishing business and SMEJ. However, results for the previous fiscal year in the Music segment include the consolidated results for SMEIs recorded music business for all twelve months of the fiscal year, as well as the full years results for SMEIs music publishing business and SMEJ. In July 2004, in order to establish a more efficient and coordinated semiconductor supply structure, Sony completed the integration of its semiconductor manufacturing business by transferring Sony Computer Entertainments semiconductor manufacturing operation from the Game segment to the Electronics segment. As a result of this transfer, sales revenue and expenditures associated with this operation are now recorded within the Semiconductor category in the Electronics segment. The results for the same period of the previous fiscal year have not been restated as such comparable figures cannot be practically obtained given that it was not operated as a separate business within the Game segment. This integration of the semiconductor manufacturing businesses is a part of Sonys semiconductor strategy of utilizing semiconductor technologies and manufacturing equipment originally developed or designed for the Game business within Sony as a whole. Electronics Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased 20.7 billion yen, or 0.4 percent, to 5,021.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 34.3 billion in the Electronics segment was recorded compared to the operating loss of 6.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Sales to outside customers on a yen basis decreased 1.1 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Regarding sales to outside customers by geographical area, although sales decreased in Japan by 10 percent and in the U.S. by 4 percent, they remained almost unchanged in Europe and increased by 9 percent in non-Japan Asia and other geographic areas (Other Areas). In Japan, although there was a significant increase in the sales of LCD televisions, and an increase in the sales of DVD recorders (including PSX), there was a decrease in the sales of PCs, cellular phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson, broadcast- and professional-use equipment and CRT televisions. In the U.S., there was an increase in sales of LCD rear projection televisions and digital still cameras, although sales mainly of CRT televisions, PCs, computer displays and portable audio declined. In Europe, sales increased, primarily of digital still cameras, LCD televisions and plasma televisions. However, there was a decrease in the sales mainly of CRT televisions and portable audio. In Other Areas, sales mainly of digital still cameras, CD-R/ RW and DVD+/-R/ RW drives and PCs increased while sales of primarily portable audio, optical pickups and home audio decreased. Performance by Product Category Sales and operating revenue by product category discussed below represent sales to outside customers, which do not include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 34 Table of Contents Audio sales decreased by 103.6 billion yen, or 15.3 percent, to 571.9 billion yen. Sales of headphone stereos declined as a result of a significant decrease in the unit shipments of both CD format and MD format devices due to a shift in demand towards hard disc- and flash-based memory players. Worldwide shipments of CD format devices decreased by approximately 3.68 million units to approximately 7.28 million units and worldwide shipments of MD format devices decreased by approximately 1.44 million units to 1.92 million units. Sales of home audio declined primarily due to a contraction of the market. On the other hand, overall sales of car audio increased slightly due to strong sales in the European market and Other Areas. Video sales increased by 85.5 billion yen, or 9.0 percent, to 1,034.7 billion yen. There was a growth in the sales of digital still cameras outside of Japan and DVD recorders (including PSX) recorded a significant increase in sales worldwide. Worldwide shipments of digital still cameras increased by approximately 4.0 million units to approximately 14.0 million units. Worldwide shipments of DVD recorders were approximately 650,000 units in the previous fiscal year but increased to approximately 1.7 million units in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Worldwide shipments of home-use video cameras increased by approximately 750,000 units to approximately 7.35 million units, but overall sales remained almost unchanged, due to increased price competition. DVD-Video player sales decreased due to pricing pressure, although unit shipments increased by approximately 1.0 million units to approximately 9.5 million units. Televisions sales increased by 31.6 billion yen, or 3.4 percent, to 957.1 billion yen. In addition to a significant increase in worldwide sales of LCD televisions, there was a significant increase in the sales of plasma televisions outside of Japan, particularly in Europe, and of projection televisions in the U.S. Worldwide shipments of LCD televisions increased by approximately 570,000 units, compared to the previous fiscal year, to approximately 1.0 million units; plasma television shipments increased by approximately 90,000 units to approximately 300,000 units; and projection televisions shipments increased by approximately 280,000 units to approximately 1.2 million units. On the other hand, although there was an increase in worldwide shipments of CRT televisions by approximately 100,000 units to approximately 9.5 million units, sales decreased significantly as a result of a fall in unit prices due to the continued shift in demand towards flat panel televisions. In addition, sales of computer displays also decreased worldwide. Information and Communications sales decreased by 56.4 billion yen, or 6.8 percent, to 778.4 billion yen. Despite an increase in notebook PC sales due to strong sales outside Japan, overall sales decreased due to a decrease in sales of desktop PCs. Worldwide unit shipments of PCs increased approximately 100,000 units to approximately 3.3 million units. Sales of personal digital assistants decreased significantly due to a downsizing of the business. Sales of broadcast- and professional-use products decreased slightly compared to the previous fiscal year, despite recording increased sales outside Japan, as sales in Japan decreased as a result of the recording of higher sales, in the previous fiscal year, from the sale of equipment to two television stations which opened new broadcasting facilities. Semiconductors sales decreased by 6.9 billion yen, or 2.7 percent, to 246.3 billion yen. The decrease was due to a decrease in sales of CCDs as the result of pricing pressures. Regarding LCDs, sales of low temperature polysilicon LCDs for cellular phones increased significantly. Components sales decreased by 4.3 billion yen, or 0.7 percent, to 619.5 billion yen. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales of CD-R/ RW drives and optical pickups associated mainly with significant declines in unit prices. Sales of DVD+/-R/ RW drives increased due to a production and sales alliance with a third party. Regarding lithium-ion batteries, sales for use in digital still cameras and cellular phones increased. Other sales increased by 2.1 billion yen, or 0.4 percent, to 578.3 billion yen. The increase resulted from increased sales at Sonys non-Japan based disc manufacturing business. However, there was a slight decrease in sales of mobile phone handsets mainly to Sony Ericsson. In the Electronics segment, cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased by 129.1 billion yen, or 3.3 percent to 4,079.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales to sales ratio deteriorated by 2.9 percent to 81.8 percent compared to 78.9 percent in the previous fiscal year. Products that contributed to the deterioration in the cost of sales to sales ratio were CRT televisions and portable audio products, which both experienced a decrease in sales, and DVD recorders (including PSX) and 35 Table of Contents video cameras, which were both impacted by falling unit prices. Restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales amounted to 9.6 billion yen, a decrease of 0.5 billion yen compared with the 10.1 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs increased 2.4 billion yen, or 0.5 percent, from 430.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 432.8 billion yen. Although there was an increase in research and development costs within the segment as a result of the transfer of semiconductor manufacturing operations from the Game segment to the Electronics segment in association with the business integration of Sonys semiconductor manufacturing operations, overall research and development costs within the segment only increased slightly as a result of the carrying out of a stringent process for the selection of research and development activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 116.3 billion yen, or 10.9 percent to 953.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The primary reason for this decrease was a decrease in restructuring charges. Of the restructuring charges recorded in the Electronics segment, the amount recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 71.4 billion yen from 124.7 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 53.3 billion yen. Of the restructuring charges recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, the amount recorded for headcount reductions, including reductions through the early retirement program, was 50.3 billion yen, a decrease of 67.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. On the other hand, royalty expenses increased 17.3 billion yen. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased 2.2 percentage points from the 21.2 percent recorded in the previous fiscal year to 19.0 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net decreased 6.0 billion yen to 23.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This amount includes 18.8 billion yen in restructuring charges, which includes 7.5 billion yen related to CRT and CRT televisions manufacturing facilities in Europe. The amount of restructuring charges included in loss on sale, disposal or impairment, net in the previous fiscal year was 10.6 billion yen. An increased operating loss was recorded in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 due to a significant deterioration in the cost of sales ratio, as mentioned above. Regarding profit performance by product, excluding restructuring charges, semiconductors recorded an operating loss for the fiscal year, compared to the operating profit of the previous fiscal year. This loss was due to the recording, within the Electronics segment, of research and development costs related to system large scale integration (LSI) manufacturing, in particular the next generation processor chip, as a result of the integration of Sonys semiconductor manufacturing business operations within the Electronics segment mentioned above. These costs were previously recorded within the Game segment. CRT televisions and portable audio products recorded a loss for the fiscal year compared to the operating income recorded in the previous fiscal year. DVD recorders (including PSX) also experienced an increased operating loss. The operating income for video cameras also decreased. On the other hand, results were positively affected by a decreased operating loss from personal digital assistants through the implementation of significant business downsizing, and a significant increase in operating income recorded for PCs and broadcast- and professional-use products. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Approximately 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 took place in Japan, including the production of digital still cameras, video cameras, flat panel televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and Memory Sticks. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for approximately 10 percent of total annual production, approximately 70 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for slightly more than 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining slightly less than 30 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. 36 Table of Contents Comparison of Results on a Local Currency Basis and Results on a Yen Basis In the Electronics segment, the negative effect of the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar exceeded the positive effect of the appreciation of the euro against the yen. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased, on a yen basis, by 0.4 percent, but increased on a local currency basis by approximately 1 percent. In terms of operating performance, there was a deterioration in the operating loss compared to the previous fiscal year, but if calculated on a local currency basis, this operating loss was smaller compared to the actual results on a yen basis. Sales to outside customers by geographic area on a yen basis decreased in Japan by 10 percent, and in the U.S. by 4 percent: however, sales in Europe remained relatively unchanged and sales increased in Other Areas by 9 percent. Sales on a local currency basis for regions outside Japan increased in the U.S. by 1 percent and in Other Areas by 13 percent, but decreased in Europe by 2 percent. Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 50.5 billion yen, or 6.5 percent, to 729.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 24.4 billion yen, or 36.1 percent, to 43.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and the operating income margin decreased from 8.7 percent to 5.9 percent. Sales in the Game segment on a local currency basis decreased approximately 6 percent. In addition, on a local currency basis, operating income decreased approximately 45 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. By region, although sales increased in Japan, there was a decrease in sales in the U.S. and Europe. Hardware sales declined. Although there was an increase in sales in Japan primarily associated with the launch of PlayStation Portable in December 2004, there was a decline in hardware sales in the U.S. and Europe associated with a decline in unit sales, and strategic price reductions, of PS2. On the other hand, both units sales and overall sales of software increased in Japan, the U.S. and Europe. Total worldwide production shipments of hardware and software were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Cumulative as of 2004 2005 March 31, 2005 (Million units) Total Production Shipments of Hardware* PlayStation + PS one 3.31 2.77 102.49 PlayStation 2 20.10 16.17 87.47 PlayStation Portable 2.97 2.97 Total Production Shipments of Software*/** PlayStation 32.00 10.00 959.00 PlayStation 2 222.00 252.00 824.00 PlayStation Portable 5.70 5.70 * Production shipments of hardware and software are counted upon shipment of the products from manufacturing bases. Sales of such products are recognized when the products are delivered to customers. ** Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. Operating income decreased compared with the previous fiscal year. Although there was an increase in software sales, the decrease in operating income was the result of a decrease in hardware sales coupled primarily with start up costs for the PlayStation Portable. The cost of sales to sales ratio deteriorated as a result of costs associated with both the launch of the PlayStation Portable and with the changeover to the new PS2 model. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales compared to the previous fiscal year was relatively unchanged. 37 Table of Contents Music Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 191.2 billion yen, or 43.4 percent, to 249.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Of the Music segments sales, 62 percent were generated by SMEJ, a Japan-based subsidiary, and 38 percent were generated by SMEI, a U.S.-based subsidiary. Compared to an operating loss of 6.0 billion yen in the previous fiscal year, operating income of 8.8 billion yen was recorded. On a local currency basis, sales in the Music segment decreased by approximately 42 percent, although the Music segment recorded operating income as compared to an operating loss in the previous fiscal year. As previously noted, the recorded music business of SMEI merged with the recorded music business of Bertelsmann AG to form SONY BMG. As a result, there were no recorded music sales at SMEI after July 31, 2004. Therefore, SMEIs results are not comparable with the results of the previous fiscal year. Sales at SMEJ increased by 6.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in album and single sales. Best-selling albums and singles during the fiscal year included musiQ by ORANGE RANGE, SENTIMENTALovers by Ken Hirai and two greatest hits albums by Porno Graffitti. Operating income increased by approximately 250 percent compared to the previous fiscal year due mainly to the higher sales noted above and an improvement in the cost of sales ratio associated with strong sales of greatest hits albums. Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 22.7 billion yen, or 3.0 percent, to 733.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 28.7 billion yen, or 81.4 percent, to 63.9 billion yen and the operating income margin increased from 4.7 percent to 8.7 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE), a U.S. based subsidiary. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment increased approximately 1 percent and operating income increased by approximately 76 percent. Sales increased primarily due to higher worldwide home entertainment, international television syndication and worldwide theatrical revenues on films. Worldwide home entertainment and international television syndication revenues were higher as a result of the performance of films from the prior year release slate including 50 First Dates, Big Fish and Bad Boys 2. For theatrical revenues, the success of the current year film slate, particularly Spider-Man 2, Hitch and The Grudge, more than offset the impact of releasing fewer films this fiscal year. Sales for the fiscal year release slate decreased 70 million U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. However, sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 from the prior year release slate increased 304 million U.S. dollars as compared to sales in the previous fiscal year from the release slate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. While benefiting from higher theatrical revenues, total fiscal year release slate revenues were lower due to the timing of the fiscal years film slates release in the home entertainment market. The higher sales from films were partially offset by a 248 million U.S. dollar decrease in sales resulting from the absence in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 of several transactions in the television business that occurred in the prior fiscal year. These included syndication sales of King of Queens and Seinfeld as well as the extension of a licensing agreement for Wheel of Fortune. Television sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 benefited from the highly successful DVD release of Seinfeld. Operating income for the segment increased significantly, resulting in record operating income for the segment, due to the strong overall performance of the current year film slate and the home entertainment and international television syndication carryover performance of the prior year film slate noted above. Operating loss from the fiscal year release slate decreased 415 million U.S. dollars and operating income for the prior years release slate increased 173 million U.S. dollars as compared to the prior year. Spider-Man 2s worldwide success contributed substantially to this fiscal years earnings, offset somewhat by the disappointing theatrical performance of Spanglish. Further improving operating income was a 38 million U.S. dollar decrease in restructuring charges. Partially offsetting these increases in operating income was the impact of the absence of 38 Table of Contents the television transactions noted above, which reduced operating income by approximately 150 million U.S. dollars due primarily to the factors noted above for revenue. As of March 31, 2005, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television product. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year that the product is available for broadcast. Financial Services Please note that the revenue and operating income at Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Sony Life), Sony Assurance Inc. (Sony Assurance) and Sony Bank Inc. (Sony Bank) discussed below differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 33.0 billion yen, or 5.6 percent, to 560.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 0.3 billion yen, or 0.6 percent, to 55.5 billion yen and the operating income margin increased to 9.9 percent compared with the 9.3 percent of the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue decreased by 38.7 billion yen, or 7.5 percent, to 474.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The main reasons for the decrease in revenue were a change in the method of recognizing insurance premiums received on certain products, as of the third quarter beginning October 1, 2003, from being recorded as revenues to being offset against the related provision for future insurance policy benefits, coupled with a small decrease in valuation gains in the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year in which significant valuation gains were recorded against stock conversion rights from convertible bonds. Although there was a decrease in insurance premium revenue as a result of the above mentioned change in accounting method, there were increases in insurance-in-force at the end of the fiscal year compared to the end of the previous fiscal year. Operating income at Sony Life decreased by 2.2 billion yen or 3.4 percent to 61.0 billion yen, mainly due to a decrease in valuation gains against stock conversion rights from convertible bonds, although this was partially offset by an increase in revenue from insurance premiums excluding the effect of the change in revenue recognition method noted above. In addition, the impact on operating income from the change in revenue recognition method noted above was slight. At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by an expansion in automobile insurance-in-force. Operating income increased due to an increase in insurance revenue, although there was a deterioration in the loss ratio (the ratio of insurance payouts to premiums). At Sony Bank, which started operations in June 2001, revenue rose as there was an increase in interest revenue associated with an increase in the balance of funds from investing activities. Although revenue increased, an increase in operating expenses resulted in a relatively unchanged operating loss compared with the previous fiscal year. At Sony Finance International, Inc. (Sony Finance), a leasing and credit financing business subsidiary in Japan, revenue decreased due to a fall in leasing revenue. In terms of profitability, the operating loss decreased due to the recording of a loss, in the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, from the lease of certain fixed assets to Crosswave Communications Inc (Crosswave), which commenced reorganization proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Law of Japan during the same fiscal year. Condensed Statements of Income Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of income for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services as well as condensed consolidated statements of income. This presentation is not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. 39 Table of Contents Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 13.9 billion yen, or 5.2 percent, to 254.4 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of total segment sales, 72 percent were sales to outside customers. In terms of profit performance, operating losses for the segment improved for the fiscal year from 12.1 billion yen to 4.1 billion yen. During the fiscal year, sales decreased primarily as the result of a decrease in intersegment sales due to contract changes at a Japanese subsidiary involved in the advertising agency business. Regarding profit performance, an operating loss of 4.1 billion yen was recorded, an 8.0 billion yen improvement on the 12.1 billion yen loss recorded in the previous fiscal year. This improvement was mainly due to a reduction of fixed costs, a gain from the sale of a retail and showroom building in Japan and the strong performance of a business engaged in the production and marketing of animation products. Segment losses decreased despite the absence in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 of a 7.7 billion yen one-time gain recorded at a business operated by a U.S. subsidiary on the sale of rights related to a portion of the Sony Credit Card portfolio in the previous fiscal year. Changes in the Classification of Business Segments for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006 In association with a significant contraction in the size of the Music segment as a result of the establishment of SONY BMG in August, 2004, Sony will discontinue the separate reporting of the Music segment as of the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, and will instead consolidate its results within the Other segment. After the establishment of SONY BMG, for the second half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, sales revenue for the Music segment (including intersegment sales) was 2.3 percent of total consolidated sales and operating income was 7.9 percent of the total operating income for all segments recording an operating profit. In addition, total assets for the Music segment, as of March 31, 2005, were 3.5 percent of the total assets for all segments. Furthermore, as of the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing and distribution business, previously classified within the Music segment, is scheduled to be reclassified to the Electronics segment. 41 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the average value of the yen was 106.5 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 133.7 yen against the euro, which was 5.2 percent higher against the U.S. dollar and 1.9 percent lower against the euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. Operating results on a local currency basis described in Overview and Operating Performance show results of sales and operating revenue and operating income obtained by applying the yens monthly average exchange rate in the previous fiscal year to monthly local currency-denominated sales, cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, as if the value of the yen had remained constant. In the Music segment, Sony consolidates the yen-translated results of SMEI (a U.S. based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis) and the results of SMEJ (a Japan based operation that aggregates the results of its operations in yen). In addition, in the Music segment, results for this fiscal year only include the results of SMEIs recorded music business for the months of April through July 2004, and the twelve month results for SMEIs music publishing business and SMEJ. However, results for the previous fiscal year in the Music segment include the consolidated results for SMEIs recorded music business for all twelve months, as well as the full years results for SMEIs publishing business and SMEJ. In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S. based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SMEI and SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a local currency basis and results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. In addition, Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that local currency basis results provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations mainly derived from the fact that the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. Sony Global Treasury Services Plc (SGTS) in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycle for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment utilized for portfolio investments. To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. 42 Table of Contents Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in Other Income and Expenses. The notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts, currency option contracts purchased and currency option contracts written as of March 31, 2005 were 1,545.8 billion yen, 428.3 billion yen and 146.5 billion yen, respectively. Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2004 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2003 Overview Although the global economy showed some signs of growth in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, the political situation, especially in Iraq, and concern about potential terrorist attacks led to a continued sense of uncertainty regarding the economy. In Japan, although the stock market showed signs of recovery, questions remained about the sustainability of economic growth and the strength of the recovery in consumer spending. Despite these market conditions and the impact of the translation of financial results into yen, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), the currency in which Sonys financial statements are prepared, Sonys sales and operating revenue (sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased 0.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Sales to outside customers in the Electronics segment increased, and revenue in the Financial Services segment increased due to improvements in valuation gains and losses at Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Sony Life), despite a decrease in sales in the Game, Pictures and Music segments. Operating income decreased 46.7 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. This decrease was mainly due to the increase in restructuring charges in the Electronics segment, the decrease in sales and increase in research and development costs in the Game segment, and the absence of profits contributed by the breakaway performance of Spider-Man in the previous fiscal year in the Pictures segment. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating income were the improvements in valuation gains and losses from investments in the general account at Sony Life in the Financial Services segment, and the benefits of restructuring, a decrease in restructuring charges and a reduction in advertising and promotion expenses in the Music segment. On a local currency basis (regarding references to results of operations expressed on a local currency basis, refer to Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging below), Sonys sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased approximately 3 percent, and operating income decreased approximately 47 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 168.1 billion yen, an increase from the 106.3 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The primary restructuring activities were in the Electronics, Music and Pictures segments. Of the total restructuring costs incurred, Sony recorded 133.4 billion yen of personnel related costs. This expense was incurred because 9,000 people, mainly in Japan, the U.S. and Western Europe, left the company primarily through early retirement programs. Of the 9,000 people, 5,000 were people who left the company in Japan. For more detailed information about restructuring, please refer to Note 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Table of Contents Electronics Restructuring charges in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 were 145.4 billion yen, compared to 80.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Of these restructuring charges, 8.0 billion yen and 2.1 billion yen for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, were recorded in the non-Japan based disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses, formerly included within the Music segment but reclassified to the Electronics segment. See Note 24 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this reclassification. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Sony made a decision to shut down certain TV display CRT manufacturing operations in Japan to rationalize production facilities and downsize its business, due to a contraction in the market and a shift in demand from CRT televisions to plasma and liquid crystal display (LCD) panel televisions. Restructuring charges associated with the shut down totaled 8.5 billion yen, and consisted of 3.1 billion yen in personnel related costs and 5.3 billion yen in non-cash equipment impairment, disposal and other costs. Of the 8.5 billion yen in restructuring charges, 0.2 billion yen was recorded in cost of sales, 3.1 billion yen was included in selling, general and administrative expense, and 5.2 billion yen was included in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net. In addition to the above restructuring effort, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, the Electronics segment accelerated the implementation of headcount reduction through early retirement programs resulting in personnel related costs of 114.9 billion yen, an increase of 92.6 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Of the 9,000 people who left the company on a consolidated basis, the majority came from the Electronics segment. The headcount of relatively high-paid white collar employees in Japan, the U.S. and Western Europe was reduced through early retirement programs while the headcount increased at manufacturing facilities in East Asia, particularly in China. Music Restructuring charges in the Music segment, including at SMEJ, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 were 9.9 billion yen, compared to 16.0 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. In response to the continued contraction of the worldwide music market due to slow worldwide economic growth, the saturation of the CD market, the effects of piracy and other illegal duplication, parallel imports, pricing pressures and the diversification of customer preferences, Sony has been actively repositioning the Music segment for the future by looking to create a more effective and profitable business model. As a result, the Music segment has undergone a worldwide restructuring program since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 to reduce staffing and other costs through the consolidation and rationalization of facilities worldwide. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Sony broadened the scope of its worldwide restructuring of the Music segment, which resulted in restructuring charges totaling 8.6 billion yen at SMEI, compared to 14.4 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. These restructuring charges exclude restructuring charges, including costs relating to the shutdown of CD manufacturing activities in the U.S., that were recorded in the non-Japan based disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses that were formerly included in the Music segment but have now been reclassified to the Electronics segment. Restructuring activities at SMEI included the restructuring of the music label operations and further rationalization of overhead functions through staff reductions. The restructuring charges consisted of personnel related costs of 4.3 billion yen, lease abandonment costs of 1.3 billion yen and other related costs of 3.0 billion yen including non-cash asset impairments and disposals. Most of these charges were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. Positions were eliminated across various employee levels, business functions, operating units, and geographic regions during this phase of the worldwide restructuring program. Pictures Restructuring charges in the Pictures segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 were 4.6 billion yen, compared to 0.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. A variety of initiatives were undertaken in the segment in an effort to reduce fixed costs including the reduction of staffing levels and the disposal of certain 44 Table of Contents long-lived assets. Restructuring charges consisted of 1.0 billion yen of personnel related costs, 1.7 billion yen of non-cash asset impairment and disposal costs and 1.9 billion yen of other restructuring costs. Among these charges, 1.5 billion yen was recorded in cost of sales, 1.3 billion yen was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and 1.7 billion yen was recorded in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net. Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2003 2004 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,473.6 7,496.4 +0.3 % Operating income 185.4 98.9 -46.7 Income before income taxes 247.6 144.1 -41.8 Equity in net income of affiliated companies (44.7 ) 1.7  Net income 115.5 88.5 -23.4 Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased by 22.8 billion yen, or 0.3 percent, to 7,496.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. (Sales in this analysis of the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue, and excludes Financial Service revenue. This is because Financial Service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Furthermore, in the analysis of cost of sales, including research and development costs, to sales, only net sales are used. This is because cost of sales is an expense associated only with net sales. All the ratios below that pertain to business segments are calculated with intersegment transactions included.) Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased by 78.8 billion yen, or 1.6 percent, to 5,058.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and increased from 72.0 percent to 73.5 percent as a percentage of sales. Year on year, the cost of sales ratio was almost unchanged from 78.8 percent to 78.9 percent in the Electronics segment and almost unchanged from 70.2 percent to 70.1 percent in the Game segment. The cost of sales ratio decreased from 58.8 percent to 58.5 percent in the Music segment. However, the cost of sales ratio increased from 58.2 percent to 60.0 percent in the Pictures segment. In the Electronics segment, the benefit of restructuring undertaken in previous fiscal years was offset primarily by an increase in research and development costs during the fiscal year. In the Game segment, the effect of increased PS2 software sales was offset by increased research and development costs. The cost of sales ratio in the Music segment decreased due to the benefits from restructuring activities implemented over the past several fiscal years. However, the cost of sales ratio in the Pictures segment increased due to the absence of the higher margins generated by revenues from Spider-Man in the prior fiscal year. Personnel related costs included in cost of sales increased only 1.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs (included in cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased by 71.4 billion yen, or 16.1 percent, to 514.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, primarily due to increases in the Electronics and Game segments. The ratio of research and development costs to sales increased from 6.4 percent to 7.5 percent. 45 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased by 15.9 billion yen, or 0.9 percent, to 1,798.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased from 25.6 percent in the previous fiscal year to 25.9 percent. Year on year, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased from 19.8 percent to 21.2 percent in the Electronics segment, from 18.0 percent to 21.1 percent in the Game segment, from 34.4 percent to 35.0 percent in the Pictures segment, and from 41.2 percent to 41.8 percent in the Music segment. Of selling, general and administrative expenses, personnel related costs increased by 89.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in severance related expenses in the Electronics segment resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives. However, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in royalty expenses, which decreased by 20.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year due to the reversal, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, of royalty expense reserves provided for in the previous fiscal year in the Electronics segment. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net decreased 4.4 billion yen, or 11.1 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, to 35.5 billion yen. Losses were recorded on the sale, disposal and impairment of CRT production equipment in the Electronics segment, on the impairment of goodwill that resulted from the making of a manufacturing subsidiary into a wholly owned subsidiary in the Electronics segment, and on the commencement of reorganization proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Law of Japan by Crosswave, which leased fixed assets from a business in the Financial Services segment. On the other hand, a one time gain was recorded in the Other segment due to the sale of rights to a portion of the Sony Card portfolio. Operating Income Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased by 86.5 billion yen, or 46.7 percent, to 98.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income margin decreased from 2.5 percent to 1.3 percent. The Electronics segment recorded an operating loss mainly due to an increase in restructuring charges. On the other hand, the business segments that contributed the most to operating income, in descending order by amount of financial impact, were the Game and Financial Services segments. Other Income and Expenses In the consolidated results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, other income decreased by 35.2 billion yen, or 22.4 percent, to 122.3 billion yen, while other expenses decreased by 18.2 billion yen, or 19.1 percent, to 77.1 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 45.2 billion yen, a decrease of 17.0 billion yen, or 27.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. The decrease in other income was primarily due to the recording, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, of a 66.5 billion yen gain on the sale of Sonys equity interest in Telemundo, a U.S. based Spanish language television network and station group that was accounted for under the equity method. Partially offsetting the decrease in other income was a 16.1 billion yen increase in net foreign exchange gain, from 1.9 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 18.1 billion yen. The net foreign exchange gain was recorded because the value of the yen, especially during the second half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, was higher than the value of the yen at the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts are entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. Compared to the previous fiscal year, royalty income increased 1.9 billion yen, or 5.8 percent, from 32.4 billion yen to 34.2 billion yen. Interest and dividends received increased by 4.3 billion yen, or 29.9 percent, to 18.8 billion yen. 46 Table of Contents The decrease in other expenses was primarily due to a 6.7 billion yen, or 29.0 percent, decrease to 16.5 billion yen in loss on devaluation of securities investments compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, the valuation losses Sony recorded included 10.3 billion yen recorded in regards to securities issued by a privately held Japanese company engaged in cable broadcasting and other businesses which Sony accounted for under the cost method. Compared to the previous fiscal year, interest paid increased 0.5 billion yen, or 2.0 percent, to 27.8 billion yen. In January 2004, FeliCa Networks Inc. (FeliCa Networks) issued 11.5 billion yen in shares (115,000 shares at 100,000 yen per share) in a private offering. FeliCa Networks engages in the development and licensing of an Integrated Circuit (IC) chip for cellular phones based on the contactless IC card technology FeliCa, which was developed by Sony. It also operates a platform, based on FeliCa-ready cellular phones, for use by service providers. Sony recorded a gain of 3.4 billion yen and also recorded deferred taxes on this gain. This issuance reduced Sonys ownership interest from 100 percent to 60 percent. In June 2004, FeliCa Networks allocated new shares to a third party; Sonys ownership interest is now approximately 57 percent. In addition to the above transaction, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Sony recognized 1.5 billion yen of other gains on issuances of stock by subsidiaries and equity investees resulting in total gains of 4.9 billion yen. These transactions were not part of a broader corporate reorganization and the reacquisition of such shares was not contemplated at the time of issuance. Income before Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased 103.6 billion yen, or 41.8 percent, to 144.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. As mentioned above, operating income and the net amount of other income and other expenses decreased compared with the previous fiscal year. Income Taxes Income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased by 28.1 billion yen, or 34.7 percent, to 52.8 billion yen, as a result of the decrease in income before income taxes. Income taxes decreased 91.6 billion yen, or 51.2 percent, to 87.2 billion yen, while deferred income tax expense decreased by 63.6 billion yen, or 64.9 percent, to 34.4 billion yen. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year was 36.6 percent, lower than the statutory rate in Japan due to a decrease in deferred tax liabilities on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and because U.S. income was taxed at a lower rate due to utilization of tax loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards. However, this rate was higher than the effective tax rate of 32.6 percent in the prior fiscal year, which benefited from a reversal in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets by Aiwa Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Aiwa). Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method Equity in net income of affiliated companies during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 was 1.7 billion yen, an improvement over the 44.7 billion yen in losses recorded in the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of Sony Ericsson, a joint venture focused on mobile phone handsets, was 6.4 billion yen, an improvement from the 20.8 billion yen in losses recorded in the previous fiscal year. This improvement was due to strong demand for Sony Ericssons products, particularly in the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Japanese markets, and due to improvements in operating efficiencies at the company. Moreover, S.T. Liquid Crystal Display Corporation (ST-LCD), an LCD joint venture in Japan, recorded a profit compared with a loss in the previous fiscal year. Partially offsetting these improvements were equity in net losses of some other affiliated companies such as Crosswave, which commenced reorganization proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Law of Japan during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. The equity in net loss related to Crosswave for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 was 1.4 billion yen. 47 Table of Contents Minority Interest in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased 4.2 billion yen, or 63.9 percent, to 2.4 billion yen. This decrease is due to the absence of the previous fiscal year increase which resulted from the reversal, in that fiscal year, of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets held by Aiwa, as described above, and the fact that Sony ceased to record a minority interest in the losses of Aiwa in that fiscal year, as a result of taking Aiwa private. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, minority interest in income was recorded mainly at certain television and home entertainment subsidiaries in the Pictures segment. Net Income Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased by 27.0 billion yen, or 23.4 percent, to 88.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. As a percentage of sales, net income decreased 0.3 percentage points from 1.5 percent to 1.2 percent. Although income before income taxes decreased as described above, the year on year change from loss to income in equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies partially offset the decline in net income. Return on stockholders equity decreased 1.2 percentage points from 5.0 percent to 3.8 percent. (This ratio is calculated by dividing net income by the simple average of stockholders equity at the end of the previous fiscal year and at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.) Basic net income per share was 95.97 yen compared with 125.74 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net income per share was 87.00 yen compared with 118.21 yen in the previous fiscal year. Refer to Notes 2 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Segment Information Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2003 2004 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue Electronics 5,096.0 5,042.3 -1.1 % Game 955.0 780.2 -18.3 Music 466.3 440.3 -5.6 Pictures 802.8 756.4 -5.8 Financial Services 537.3 593.5 +10.5 Other 261.1 268.3 +2.7 Elimination (644.9 ) (384.7 )  Consolidated 7,473.6 7,496.4 +0.3 48 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2003 2004 Percent change (Yen in billions) Operating income (loss) Electronics 65.9 (6.8 )  Game 112.7 67.6 -40.0 % Music (28.3 ) (6.0 )  Pictures 59.0 35.2 -40.3 Financial Services 22.8 55.2 +142.4 Other (28.3 ) (12.1 )  Elimination and unallocated corporate expenses (18.3 ) (34.2 )  Consolidated 185.4 98.9 -46.7 At the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Sony partly realigned its business segment configuration. Expenses incurred in connection with the creation of a network platform business have been transferred out of the Other segment and reclassified as unallocated corporate expenses, because the expected future benefits of this business will be spread across Sony. In the Music segment, certain non-core businesses of Sony Music Entertainment (Japan), Inc., such as media, animation, character and cosmetics, were transferred to the newly-established Sony Culture Entertainment, Inc. (SCU) and SCU was classified in the Other segment. In accordance with this realignment, results of the previous fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. In connection with the establishment of the SONY BMG joint venture, Sonys non-Japan based disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses, formerly included within the Music segment, have been reclassified to the Electronics segment to reflect the new management reporting structure whereby Sonys Electronics segment has now assumed responsibility for these businesses. Results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2004 in the Electronics and Music segments have been restated to account for this reclassification. Electronics Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased by 53.7 billion yen, or 1.1 percent, to 5,042.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 6.8 billion yen was recorded compared to operating income of 65.9 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. The year-on-year decrease in sales was due to a significant decrease in intersegment sales to the Game segment as a result of the outsourcing of PS2 game console production to third parties in China. Sales to outside customers on a yen basis increased 4.6 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Regarding sales to outside customers by geographic area, sales on a yen basis increased in Japan by 11 percent, in Europe by 10 percent, and in non-Japan Asia and other geographic areas (Other Areas) by 8 percent. Sales on a yen basis in the U.S. decreased 7 percent. In Japan, mainly due to the strong sales of Sony Ericsson, sales of mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson, increased significantly. In addition, sales of charge coupled devices (CCDs), which benefited from an expansion in demand mainly from digital still cameras, DVD recorders (including PSX), plasma and LCD flat panel televisions, and broadcast- and professional-use equipment increased. On the other hand, sales of PCs and CRT televisions decreased. In Europe, sales of digital still cameras, flat panel televisions, cellular phones, and PCs increased significantly. Sales of CRT televisions, portable audio, Aiwa products, and home audio, however, decreased. In Other Areas, sales of CD-R/ RW and DVD+/-R/ RW drives, digital still cameras, PCs, and video cameras increased while sales of CRT televisions decreased. In the U.S., a significant decrease in the sales of CRT televisions combined with decreased sales of Aiwa products, computer displays, 49 Table of Contents set-top boxes, and personal digital assistants to cause a decline in sales, but sales of flat panel televisions, projection televisions, digital still cameras and PCs increased. Performance by Product Category Sales and operating revenue by product category discussed below represent sales to customers, which do not include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Audio sales decreased by 108.6 billion yen, or 13.9 percent, to 675.5 billion yen. Sales of home audio declined due to a contraction of the market and increased price competition. Regarding headphone stereos, sales declined primarily due to falling prices, but the unit shipments of both MD format and CD format devices slightly exceeded their levels in the previous fiscal year. Worldwide shipments of MD format devices increased by approximately 40,000 units to approximately 3.36 million units and worldwide shipments of CD format devices increased by approximately 240,000 units to approximately 10.96 million units. On the other hand, sales of car audio increased due to strong sales in the European market. Also, sales of Aiwa products decreased in all regions. Video sales increased by 121.0 billion yen, or 14.6 percent, to 949.3 billion yen. In addition to a significant increase in the sales of digital still cameras outside of Japan, sales of DVD recorders (including PSX) increased significantly primarily in Japan. Worldwide shipments of digital still cameras increased by approximately 4.4 million units to approximately 10 million units. Worldwide shipments of DVD recorders were approximately 20,000 units in the previous fiscal year but increased to approximately 650,000 units in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. Regarding home-use video cameras, worldwide shipments of combined analog and digital devices increased by approximately 850,000 units to approximately 6.6 million units, but overall sales increased only slightly, as sales in Japan and the U.S. decreased due to increased price competition. DVD-Video player sales decreased due to pricing pressure, although unit shipments increased. Televisions sales decreased by 56.2 billion yen, or 5.7 percent, to 925.5 billion yen. Sales of CRT televisions decreased significantly due to a contraction of the market and declining prices, resulting primarily from a shift in demand to flat panel televisions. Worldwide shipments of CRT televisions decreased approximately 600,000 units to approximately 9.4 million units compared with the previous fiscal year. Sales of computer displays also decreased worldwide. On the other hand, sales of plasma and LCD flat panel televisions increased significantly worldwide and sales of projection televisions in the U.S. increased. Worldwide shipments of flat panel televisions increased approximately 480,000 units to approximately 640,000 units. Information and Communications sales decreased by 2.0 billion yen, or 0.2 percent, to 834.8 billion yen. Despite a decrease in sales in Japan, due to price declines in the notebook PC market, overall sales of PCs increased as sales in all regions outside of Japan increased. Worldwide unit shipments of PCs increased approximately 100,000 units to approximately 3.2 million units. Sales of personal digital assistants decreased due to a contraction of the market and the effects of price declines. Sales of broadcast- and professional-use products were almost unchanged year on year as sales in Japan increased due to the sale of equipment installed in two new broadcasting stations, while many broadcasters in the U.S. and other countries outside of Japan reduced their capital expenditures. Semiconductors sales increased by 48.5 billion yen, or 23.7 percent, to 253.2 billion yen. The increase was due to a significant increase in sales of CCDs, mainly reflecting the expansion of the market for digital still cameras. Regarding LCDs, sales of low temperature polisilicon LCDs for digital still cameras and cellular phones increased significantly. Components sales increased by 96.0 billion yen, or 18.2 percent, to 623.8 billion yen. The increase was primarily due to significant increases in sales of CD-R/ RW and DVD+/-R/ RW drives, and Memory Sticks. Moreover, sales of lithium-ion batteries increased. Sales of CD-R/ RW drives increased due to a production and sales alliance with a third party, and sales of DVD+/-R/ RW drives increased as a result of the expansion of the market for those devices. Worldwide shipments of Memory Stick increased by approximately 12 million units to approximately 31 million units due to the continued, strong demand for digital still cameras. On 50 Table of Contents March 31, 2004, Sonys cumulative shipments of Memory Stick had reached approximately 66 million units. Regarding lithium-ion batteries, sales for use in digital still cameras and PCs increased. Other sales increased by 115.3 billion yen, or 25.0 percent, to 576.2 billion yen. The increase resulted from a significant increase in sales to Sony Ericsson of mobile phone handsets, reflecting an increase in the sales of Sony Ericssons handsets. On the other hand, disc manufacturing sales decreased due to the appreciation of the yen. In the Electronics segment, cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased by 41.1 billion yen, or 1.0 percent to 3,950.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales to sales ratio increased 0.1 percentage point from 78.8 percent to 78.9 percent. Products that contributed to an increase in the cost of sales to sales ratio was a significant increase in the sales of mobile phone handsets, produced for Sony Ericsson, which have a relatively high cost of sales to sales ratio. Offsetting this increase, however, were PCs, which benefited from an emphasis on profitability and an increase in the proportion of high value added models in the product line-up, and low temperature polysilicon LCDs, which benefited from a significant expansion in sales. Restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales amounted to 10.1 billion yen compared with 22.2 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs increased 49.2 billion yen, or 12.9 percent, from 381.2 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 430.5 billion yen. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 59.6 billion yen, or 5.9 percent to 1,069.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The primary reason for this increase was an increase in restructuring charges. Of the restructuring charges recorded in the Electronics segment, the amount recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 80.4 billion yen from 44.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 124.7 billion yen. Of the restructuring charges recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, the amount recorded for headcount reductions, including reductions through the early retirement program, was 118.0 billion yen, an increase of 85.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. In addition to these personnel related costs, restructuring charges were recorded in relation to TV display CRT manufacturing facilities in Japan. In contrast to the increase in restructuring charges, royalty expenses decreased 20.4 billion yen and after sales service expenses decreased 8.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased 1.4 percentage points from 19.8 percent recorded in the previous fiscal year to 21.2 percent, due to the decrease in sales. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net increased 0.6 billion yen to 29.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This amount includes 10.6 billion yen in restructuring charges, which includes 5.2 billion yen related to the TV display CRT manufacturing facilities in Japan. The amount of restructuring charges included in loss on sale, disposal or impairment, net in the previous fiscal year was 13.9 billion yen. Regarding profit performance of the segment, an operating loss was recorded for the fiscal year due to a significant increase in restructuring charges, especially severance-related expenses, as mentioned above. Regarding profit performance by product, excluding restructuring charges, compared with the previous fiscal year, operating income was recorded in PCs compared with an operating loss in the previous fiscal year, and a significant increase in operating income of CCDs was recorded. Losses from Aiwa products decreased while the operating income of CD-R/ RW and DVD+/-R/ RW drives, as well as of video cameras, increased. On the other hand, operating income of CRT televisions decreased significantly while operating income of optical pickups decreased due to a sharp decline in prices. Furthermore, personal digital assistants recorded an operating loss compared with operating income recorded in the previous fiscal year. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Approximately 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production took place in Japan, including the production of digital still cameras, video cameras, flat panel televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and Memory Sticks. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for approximately 10 percent of total annual production, approximately 70 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan and 51 Table of Contents China, accounted for approximately 15 percent of total annual production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining approximately 25 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Until July 2003, total annual production included the assembly of PS2 hardware for the Game segment; however, due to the outsourcing of PS2 hardware production to China-based third parties, this assembly activity ceased in July 2003. Comparison of Results on a Local Currency Basis and Results on a Yen Basis In the Electronics segment, the negative effect of the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar slightly exceeded the positive effect of the appreciation of the euro against the yen. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased, on a yen basis, by 1.1 percent, but increased on a local currency basis by approximately 1 percent. In terms of operating performance on a local currency basis, a small operating profit was recorded compared to the operating loss on a yen basis. Regarding sales to outside customers by geographic area, sales on a yen basis increased in Japan by 11 percent, in Europe by 10 percent, and in Other Areas by 8 percent. Sales on a yen basis in the U.S. decreased 7 percent. Sales on a local currency basis for regions outside Japan increased in every region, with sales in Europe increasing 4 percent, sales in Other Areas increasing 14 percent and sales in the U.S. increasing 1 percent. Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased by 174.8 billion yen, or 18.3 percent, to 780.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 45.1 billion yen, or 40.0 percent, to 67.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and the operating income margin decreased from 11.8 percent to 8.7 percent. Sales in the Game segment on a local currency basis decreased 18 percent, approximately the same as on a yen basis. In regards to operating income, the positive impact of the depreciation of the yen against the euro exceeded the negative impact of the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar, resulting in a 52 percent decrease in operating income on a local currency basis. By region, sales decreased in Japan, the U.S. and Europe. In Japan, hardware sales declined due to a strategic price reduction of PS2 hardware, despite higher unit sales of PS2 hardware. Software sales in Japan also decreased due to lower unit sales. In the U.S., sales declined due to a decrease in unit sales of PS2 hardware, a strategic price reduction of PS2 hardware and a decrease in software unit sales. In Europe, although hardware unit sales increased as the market penetration of PS2 hardware continued to expand, hardware sales declined due to a strategic price reduction of PS2 hardware. Software unit sales and software sales in Europe both increased. Total worldwide production shipments of hardware and software were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Cumulative as of 2003 2004 March 31, 2004 (Million units) Total Production Shipments of Hardware* PlayStation + PS one 6.78 3.31 99.72 PlayStation 2 22.52 20.10 71.30 Total Production Shipments of Software*/** PlayStation 61.00 32.00 949.00 PlayStation 2 189.90 222.00 572.00 * Production shipments of hardware and software are counted upon shipment of the products from manufacturing bases. Sales of such products are recognized when the products are delivered to customers. 52 Table of Contents ** Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. In terms of profitability, operating income decreased compared with the previous fiscal year. This decrease was due to an increase in research and development costs for future businesses and a decrease in hardware sales. Research and development costs increased by 21.9 billion yen to 83.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Although research and development costs for software development increased only slightly, costs for the development of semiconductors and process technologies increased significantly. Cost of sales in the Game segment decreased due to the decrease in hardware unit sales and reductions in the cost of producing hardware. The cost of sales to sales ratio, however, remained unchanged as the cost of producing PS2 hardware decreased in line with the decrease in hardware sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a result of a decline in advertising and promotion expenses, reflecting the decrease in hardware units sold. However, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales rose compared to the previous fiscal year as the ratio of personnel related costs and advertising and promotion expenses to sales rose compared with the previous fiscal year. Music Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased by 26.0 billion yen, or 5.6 percent, to 440.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating loss for the year ended March 31, 2004 decreased by 22.3 billion yen, or 78.8 percent, to 6.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Sales at SMEI, a U.S. based subsidiary, were flat on a U.S. dollar basis. (Refer to Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging below. ) In terms of profitability, operating results improved as the operating loss for SMEI decreased compared to the previous fiscal year. The appreciation of European currencies against the U.S. dollar contributed to higher sales outside of the U.S. which were offset by lower sales in the U.S. On a worldwide basis, total album sales at SMEI decreased due to the continued contraction of the global music industry and the lack of hit releases. Although unit sales in various markets such as the U.S. have begun to reverse their downward trend, the global music market has continued to experience an overall contraction primarily due to piracy (i.e. unauthorized file sharing and CD burning) and competition from other entertainment sectors. The improvement in profitability primarily resulted from the benefits realized from the worldwide restructuring activities implemented over the past two fiscal years to reduce costs in response to the downward trend of the market. These activities included the rationalization of support functions including record label shared services through elimination of redundancy. Operating income also benefited from lower restructuring charges as compared to the prior fiscal year. The total restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 was 76 million U.S. dollars or 8.6 billion yen, a decrease of 46 million U.S. dollars from the prior fiscal year (Refer to Restructuring above for details.) A third factor contributing to the improved operating results were lower advertising and promotion expenses. The above factors more than offset the negative effect of lower worldwide album sales. The savings realized from previously implemented restructuring initiatives, lower restructuring charges and the decrease in advertising and promotion expenses resulted in a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year and an improvement in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales. Regarding the results of SMEJ, sales were flat compared with the previous fiscal year, despite the continued contraction of the music industry. Operating income increased 69 percent compared with the prior fiscal year due to a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily advertising and promotion expenses, and strong sales of Japanese artists recordings. On a yen basis, 67 percent of the Music segments sales were generated by SMEI while 33 percent were generated by SMEJ. Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 decreased by 46.4 billion yen, or 5.8 percent, to 756.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 23.7 billion yen, or 53 Table of Contents 40.3 percent, to 35.2 billion yen and the operating income margin decreased from 7.3 percent to 4.7 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of SPE, a U.S. based subsidiary. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment increased approximately 2 percent and operating income decreased approximately 30 percent. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher television performance in the fiscal year. Television revenues increased significantly due to initial syndication sales of The King of Queens and third cycle syndication sales of Seinfeld, as well as the extension of a licensing agreement for Wheel of Fortune. This increase in sales was partially offset by lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues from the fiscal year release slate, which included such notable titles as Bad Boys 2, S.W.A.T., Anger Management and Somethings Gotta Give, when compared to the prior fiscal year release slate, which included Spider-Man, the highest grossing film in SPEs history, Men in Black II, xXx and Mr. Deeds. Sales for the fiscal year release slate decreased 359 million U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating income for the segment decreased significantly due to the absence of profits contributed by the record breaking performance of Spider-Man in the previous fiscal year and, to a lesser extent, the aggregate disappointing performance of several films from the fiscal year release slate including Gigli, Hollywood Homicide, The Missing and Charlies Angels: Full Throttle, resulting in an increase in operating loss of 412 million U.S. dollars compared to the prior fiscal year release slate. Additionally, operating income was also negatively impacted by a 38 million U.S. dollar increase in restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal year. (Refer to Restructuring above for details.) Partially offsetting these decreases in operating income was the contribution from the syndication sales and extension of a licensing agreement noted above, DVD sales of television library product and an additional syndication sale of Dawsons Creek, resulting in a 201 million U.S. dollar increase in operating income. Further improving operating income was the absence of the 66 million U.S. dollar provision recorded in the prior fiscal year with respect to previously recorded revenue from KirchMedia, a licensee in Germany of SPEs feature film and television product, and related adjustments to ultimate film income. As of March 31, 2004, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television product. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year that the product is available for broadcast. Financial Services The revenue and operating income at Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank discussed below differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased by 56.3 billion yen, or 10.5 percent, to 593.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 32.4 billion yen, or 142.4 percent, to 55.2 billion yen and the operating income margin increased to 9.3 percent compared with the 4.2 percent of the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue increased by 46.4 billion yen, or 9.9 percent, to 513.0 billion yen and operating income increased by 33.6 billion yen, or 113.3 percent, to 63.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Revenue increased due to improvements in valuation gains and losses from investments in the separate account and the general account, reflecting strength in the equity markets. This increase occurred despite a 30.8 billion yen reduction in revenue resulting from a change in the method of recognizing insurance premiums received on certain products from being recorded as revenues to being offset against the related provision for future insurance policy benefits since the third quarter beginning October 1, 2003. Insurance revenue decreased as a result of this change in method of recording revenue but the actual life insurance business remained strong as new insurance sales increased compared with the previous fiscal year, and the amount of insurance-in-force at the end of the fiscal year increased compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. Operating income at Sony Life increased due to improvements in valuation gains and losses from investments in the general account. The above mentioned change in revenue recognition method did not have a material effect on operating income. Valuation gains and losses from investments in the separate account accrue directly to the account of policyholders and, therefore, do not affect operating income. 54 Table of Contents At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by an expansion in automobile insurance-in-force. Operating income was recorded during the fiscal year compared to an operating loss in the previous fiscal year due to the increase in insurance revenue and an improvement in the expense ratio (the ratio of operating expenses to premiums) and the loss ratio (the ratio of insurance payouts to premiums). Sony Bank, which started business in June 2001, recorded a loss, as was also the case in the previous fiscal year, but the amount of loss decreased. At Sony Finance, a leasing and credit financing business subsidiary in Japan, revenue was unchanged compared to the previous fiscal year as credit financing revenue increased slightly and leasing revenue and rent revenue decreased slightly. In terms of profitability, the operating loss increased due to the recording of a loss from the lease of certain fixed assets to Crosswave, which commenced reorganization proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Law of Japan, and an increase in expenses associated with the start of a credit card business. Condensed Statements of Income Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of income for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services as well as condensed consolidated statements of income. This presentation is not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. All other segments excluding Financial Services Financial Services Consolidated Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 (Yen in millions) Financial Services revenue 537,276 593,544   509,398 565,752 Net sales and operating revenue   6,974,980 6,939,964 6,964,235 6,930,639 537,276 593,544 6,974,980 6,939,964 7,473,633 7,496,391 Costs and expenses 514,518 538,383 6,811,292 6,896,377 7,288,193 7,397,489 Operating income 22,758 55,161 163,688 43,587 185,440 98,902 Other income (expenses) net (1,282 ) 1,958 67,846 52,746 62,181 45,165 Income before income taxes 21,476 57,119 231,534 96,333 247,621 144,067 Income taxes and other 13,071 22,975 120,089 30,916 132,102 53,439 Cumulative effect of accounting changes    (2,117 )  (2,117 ) Net income 8,405 34,144 111,445 63,300 115,519 88,511 Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, sales of the Other segment were comprised mainly of an advertising agency business in Japan and SCN, an Internet-related service business subsidiary operating mainly in Japan. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased by 7.2 billion yen, or 2.7 percent, to 268.3 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of total segment sales, 64 percent were sales to outside customers. 55 Table of Contents In terms of profit performance, operating losses for the segment decreased from 28.3 billion yen to 12.1 billion yen. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, sales increased primarily due to an increase in sales at the in-house oriented information system service business, reflecting greater demand for its services by other businesses within Sony. Regarding profit performance, the segment recorded a loss primarily due to the recording of expenses associated with the development of network and content technology and services, intended to facilitate new businesses in the broadband age. Overall segment losses decreased compared to the previous fiscal year primarily because a U.S. subsidiary recorded a one-time gain of 7.7 billion yen on the sale of rights related to a portion of the Sony Card portfolio and because software in a discontinued professional-use video software business had been written off in the previous fiscal year. On the other hand, an operating loss was recorded at SCN compared with operating income in the previous fiscal year, due to increased expenses for subscriber acquisition. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, the average value of the yen was 112.1 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 131.1 yen against the euro, which was 7.3 percent higher against the U.S. dollar and 9.7 percent lower against the euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. Operating results on a local currency basis described in Overview and Operating Performance show results of sales and operating revenue and operating income obtained by applying the yens monthly average exchange rate in the previous fiscal year to monthly local currency-denominated sales, cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, as if the value of the yen had remained constant. In the Music segment, Sony consolidates the yen-translated results of SMEI (a U.S. based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis) and the results of SMEJ (a Japan based operation that aggregates the results of its operations in yen). In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S. based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SMEI and SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a local currency basis and results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. In addition, Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that local currency basis results provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency fluctuations mainly derived from the fact that the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. In 2001, SGTS was established in London for the purpose of providing integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In particular SGTS hedges the majority of the exposures on major currency pairs such as U.S. dollar against Japanese yen, euro against Japanese yen and euro against U.S. dollar, on average three months before the actual transactions take place. In the case of emerging market currencies, such as Brazil, with high inflation and high interest rates, the majority of the projected exposures are hedged one month before the actual transactions take place due to cost effectiveness considerations. Sony enters into 56 Table of Contents foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions only for hedging purposes and does not undertake speculative transactions. To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in Other Income and Expenses. The notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts, currency option contracts purchased and currency option contracts written as of March 31, 2004 were 1,348.2 billion yen, 375.6 billion yen and 124.9 billion yen, respectively. Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Assets Total assets on March 31, 2005 increased by 408.4 billion yen, or 4.5 percent, to 9,499.1 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total assets on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 32.9 billion yen, or 0.5 percent, to 6,027.9 billion yen and total assets on March 31, 2005 in the Financial Services segment increased by 410.5 billion yen, or 11.8 percent, to 3,885.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total assets on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment would have decreased by approximately 2 percent compared with the previous fiscal year-end if the value of the yen had remained the same on March 31, 2005 as it was on March 31, 2004. Current Assets Current assets on March 31, 2005 increased by 192.8 billion yen, or 5.7 percent, to 3,556.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current assets on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 99.6 billion yen, or 3.7 percent, to 2,592.8 billion yen. Cash and cash equivalents on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding Financial Services segment decreased 73.2 billion yen, or 12.3 percent, to 519.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This is primarily a result of 57.3 billion yen repayment of long-term debt relating to a variable interest entity responsible for the operation and development of a real estate complex in Berlin, Germany. Notes and accounts receivable, trade (net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns) on March 31, 2005, in all segments excluding Financial Services segment increased 9.1 billion yen, or 1.0 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year-end to 952.7 billion yen. Inventories on March 31, 2005 decreased by 35.2 billion yen, or 5.3 percent, to 631.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. The inventory to cost of sales turnover ratio (based on the average of inventories at the end of each fiscal year and previous fiscal year) was 1.56 months compared to 1.53 months at the end of the previous fiscal year. Sony considers this level of inventory to be appropriate in the aggregate. Current assets on March 31, 2005 in the Financial Services segment increased by 290.5 billion yen, or 41.5 percent, to 990.2 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in marketable securities. (Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Investments and Advances Investments and advances on March 31, 2005 increased by 232.7 billion yen, or 9.3 percent, to 2,745.7 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. 57 Table of Contents Investments and advances on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 86.8 billion yen, or 24.2 percent, to 445.4 billion yen. This increase was mainly the result of investments associated with the establishment of S-LCD, a joint venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the manufacture of amorphous TFT LCD panels. Investments and advances on March 31, 2005 in the Financial Services segment increased by 104.5 billion yen, or 4.6 percent, to 2,379.0 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily due to investments mainly in Japanese fixed income securities resulting from an increase in insurance premiums at Sony Life, and an increase in housing loans due to a campaign carried out at Sony Bank. Also see Investments below. Property, Plant and Equipment (after deduction of accumulated depreciation) Property, plant and equipment on March 31, 2005 increased by 7.4 billion yen, or 0.5 percent, to 1,372.4 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Property, plant and equipment on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 9.6 billion yen, or 0.7 percent, to 1,333.8 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Capital expenditures (part of the increase in property, plant and equipment) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 21.4 billion yen, or 5.7 percent, to 356.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the Electronics segment increased by 59.1 billion yen, or 23.5 percent, to 311.1 billion yen but decreased in the Game segment by 81.5 billion yen, or 81.2 percent, to 18.8 billion yen. Capital expenditures in the semiconductor businesses mainly in the Electronics segment amounted to 150.0 billion yen, of which investments in production equipment for system LSI including next generation broadband microprocessors amounted to 90.0 billion yen. Capital expenditures in the Music segment decreased by 0.8 billion yen, or 20.7 percent, to 2.9 billion yen, and decreased in the Pictures segment by 0.2 billion yen, or 3.4 percent to 5.8 billion yen, and decreased in the Other segment by 4.0 billion yen, or 39.3 percent, to 6.1 billion yen. Property, plant and equipment on March 31, 2005 in the Financial Services segment decreased by 2.3 billion yen, or 5.6 percent, to 38.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Capital expenditures in the Financial Services segment decreased by 0.8 billion yen, or 16.7 percent, to 3.8 billion yen. Other Assets Other assets on March 31, 2005 decreased by 46.7 billion yen, or 2.9 percent, to 1,545.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Other assets on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 62.5 billion yen to 1,189.4 billion yen. This decrease was primarily the result of the fact that, due to the establishment of SONY BMG, artists contracts belonging to the joint venture are no longer recorded as intangible assets within Sonys consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets on March 31, 2005 increased by 37.2 billion yen, or 18.3 percent, to 240.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. As a result of the recording of operating losses in the past, certain U.S. subsidiaries of Sony have had valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for U.S. federal taxes and certain state taxes. However, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, based on both improved operating results in recent years and a sound outlook for the future operating performance at Sonys U.S. subsidiaries, Sony reversed 67.9 billion yen of such valuation allowances. On the other hand, certain of Sonys subsidiaries recorded new valuation allowances against deferred tax assets during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Other assets in the Financial Services segment on March 31, 2005 increased by 17.8 billion yen, or 3.9 percent, to 477.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was mainly due to an increase in deferred insurance acquisition costs at Sony Life. 58 Table of Contents Liabilities Total current and long-term liabilities on March 31, 2005 decreased by 84.9 billion yen, or 1.3 percent, to 6,604.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total current and long-term liabilities on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 489.5 billion yen, or 12.7 percent, to 3,366.4 billion yen. Total current and long-term liabilities in the Financial Services segment on March 31, 2005 increased by 365.5 billion yen, or 11.8 percent, to 3,465.3 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total current and long-term liabilities on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment would have decreased by approximately 14 percent compared with the previous fiscal year-end if the value of the yen had remained the same on March 31, 2005 as it was on March 31, 2004. Current Liabilities Current liabilities on March 31, 2005 decreased by 172.8 billion yen, or 5.8 percent, to 2,809.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current liabilities on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 236.1 billion yen, or 9.9 percent, to 2,137.5 billion yen. Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased 205.7 billion yen, or 50.2 percent, to 204.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This decrease was mainly a result of the fact that of 300.0 billion yen of convertible bonds due on March 31, 2005, 5.0 billion yen were redeemed on the maturity date with 282.8 billion yen of the 287.8 billion yen balance outstanding at the start of the fiscal year being converted into common stock, which was partially offset by the reclassification of long term debt to current liabilities mainly consisting of 119.0 billion yen of straight bonds and bonds with warrants redeemable during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006. (Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Notes and accounts payable, trade on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 28.0 billion yen, or 3.6 percent, to 801.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end, mainly due to an increase within the Game segment. Current liabilities on March 31, 2005 in the Financial Services segment increased by 59.8 billion yen, or 9.2 percent, to 708.6 billion yen, mainly due to the increase in deposits from customers in the banking business. Deposits from customers in the banking business increased by 167.9 billion yen, or 44.3 percent, to 546.7 billion yen, due to the expansion of the banking business. Long-term Liabilities Long-term liabilities on March 31, 2005 increased by 88.0 billion yen, or 2.4 percent, to 3,795.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Long-term liabilities on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 253.5 billion yen, or 17.1 percent, to 1,228.9 billion yen. Long-term debt on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased 147.9 billion yen, or 19.1 percent, to 627.4 billion yen. This was primarily the result of the reclassification of long-term debt to current liabilities, including 119.0 billion yen of bonds redeemable during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006 and a decrease in accrued pension and severance costs of 20.2 billion yen, or 5.6 percent, to 338.0 billion yen, primarily due to the reform of Sonys employee retirement pension plan in Japan. Long-term liabilities on March 31, 2005 in the Financial Services segment increased by 305.7 billion yen, or 12.5 percent, to 2,756.7 billion yen. This was due to an increase in insurance-in-force in the life insurance business which resulted in an increase in future insurance policy benefits and other of 285.7 billion yen, or 13.1 percent, to 2,464.3 billion yen. 59 Table of Contents Total Interest-bearing Debt Total interest-bearing debt on March 31, 2005 decreased by 343.4 billion yen, or 27.4 percent, to 909.3 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total interest-bearing debt on March 31, 2005 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 353.6 billion yen, or 29.8 percent, to 831.4 billion yen. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity on March 31, 2005 increased by 492.3 billion yen, or 20.7 percent, to 2,870.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. As noted above, of 300.0 billion yen of convertible bonds due on March 31, 2005, 5.0 billion yen were redeemed on the maturity date with 282.8 billion yen of the 287.8 billion yen balance outstanding at the start of the fiscal year being converted into common stock, and, therefore, incorporated into stockholders equity and additional paid-in capital. Retained earnings increased 139.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end, and other comprehensive income (net of tax) was 64.3 billion yen. This was primarily due to comprehensive income of 74.2 billion yen arising from foreign currency translation adjustments in current fiscal year due to the devaluation of the yen, partially offset by the recording of a change in accumulated other comprehensive income of 7.3 billion yen arising from unrealized gains on securities in the current fiscal year. The ratio of stockholders equity to total assets increased 4.0 percent from 26.2 percent to 30.2 percent. Condensed Balance Sheets Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows an unaudited condensed balance sheet for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services as well as the condensed consolidated balance sheet. This presentation is not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. 60 Table of Contents Financial Services Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 (Yen in millions) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 256,316 259,371 Marketable securities 270,676 456,130 Notes and accounts receivable, trade 72,273 77,023 Other 100,433 197,667 699,698 990,191 Investments and advances 2,274,510 2,378,966 Property, plant and equipment 40,833 38,551 Other assets: Deferred insurance acquisition costs 349,194 374,805 Other 110,804 103,004 459,998 477,809 3,475,039 3,885,517 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings 86,748 45,358 Notes and accounts payable, trade 7,847 7,099 Deposits from customers in the banking business 378,851 546,718 Other 175,357 109,438 648,803 708,613 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 135,811 135,750 Accrued pension and severance costs 10,183 14,362 Future insurance policy benefits and other 2,178,626 2,464,295 Other 126,349 142,272 2,450,969 2,756,679 Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries  5,476 Stockholders equity 375,267 414,749 3,475,039 3,885,517 61 Table of Contents Sony without Financial Services Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 (Yen in millions,) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 592,895 519,732 Marketable securities 4,072 4,072 Notes and accounts receivable, trade 943,590 952,692 Other 1,151,879 1,116,353 2,692,436 2,592,849 Film costs 256,740 278,961 Investments and advances 358,629 445,446 Investments in Financial Services, at cost 176,905 187,400 Property, plant and equipment 1,324,211 1,333,848 Other assets 1,251,901 1,189,398 6,060,822 6,027,902 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings 409,766 204,027 Notes and accounts payable, trade 773,221 801,252 Other 1,190,563 1,132,201 2,373,550 2,137,480 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 775,233 627,367 Accrued pension and severance costs 358,199 338,040 Other 348,946 263,520 1,482,378 1,228,927 Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries 17,554 18,471 Stockholders equity 2,187,340 2,643,024 6,060,822 6,027,902 62 Table of Contents Consolidated Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 (Yen in millions) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 849,211 779,103 Marketable securities 274,748 460,202 Notes and accounts receivable, trade 1,011,189 1,025,362 Other 1,228,207 1,291,504 3,363,355 3,556,171 Film costs 256,740 278,961 Investments and advances 2,512,950 2,745,689 Property, plant and equipment 1,365,044 1,372,399 Other assets: Deferred insurance acquisition costs 349,194 374,805 Other 1,243,379 1,171,075 1,592,573 1,545,880 9,090,662 9,499,100 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings 475,017 230,266 Notes and accounts payable, trade 778,773 806,044 Deposits from customers in the banking business 378,851 546,718 Other 1,349,574 1,226,340 2,982,215 2,809,368 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 777,649 678,992 Accrued pension and severance costs 368,382 352,402 Future insurance policy benefits and other 2,178,626 2,464,295 Other 382,930 299,858 3,707,587 3,795,547 Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries 22,858 23,847 Stockholders equity 2,378,002 2,870,338 9,090,662 9,499,100 Investments Sony regularly evaluates its investment portfolio to identify other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities. Factors that are considered by Sony in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of issuers credit condition, sovereign risk, and whether or not Sony is able to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. 63 Table of Contents In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities with readily determinable fair values, management presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally a period of up to six to twelve months). The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of other factors which overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is not more than 20 percent or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors which may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary is often judgmental in nature and involves certain assumptions and estimates concerning the expected operating results, business plans and future cash flows of the issuer of the security. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that Sony currently believes to be temporary may be determined to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of additional information such as continued poor operating results, future broad declines in value of worldwide equity markets and the effect of world wide interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized into income in future periods. The following table contains available for sale and held to maturity securities, breaking out the unrealized gains and losses by investment category. Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2005 Cost Unrealized gain Unrealized Loss Fair Market Value (Yen in millions) Financial Services Available for sale Debt securities Sony Life 1,769,693 56,988 (2,130 ) 1,824,551 Other 315,101 1,096 (281 ) 315,916 Equity securities Sony Life 42,256 22,735 (278 ) 64,713 Other 9,469 5,172 (12 ) 14,629 Held to maturity Debt securities Sony Life     Other 27,414 530 (13 ) 27,931 Total Financial Services 2,163,933 86,521 (2,714 ) 2,247,740 Non-Financial Services: Available for sale securities 61,212 21,520 (577 ) 82,155 Held to maturity securities 17   17 Total Non-Financial Services 61,229 21,520 (577 ) 82,172 Consolidated 2,225,162 108,041 (3,291 ) 2,329,912 The most significant portion of these unrealized losses relate to investments held by Sony Life. Sony Life principally invests in debt securities in various industries. Almost all of these securities were rated BBB or better by Standard & Poors, Moodys or others. As of March 31, 2005, Sony Life had debt and equity securities which had gross unrealized losses of 2.1 billion yen and 0.3 billion yen, respectively. Of the unrealized loss amounts recorded by Sony Life, less than 1 percent relate to securities being in an unrealized loss position of greater than 12 months. These unrealized losses related to numerous investments, with no single investment being in a material unrealized loss position. In addition, there was no individual security with 64 Table of Contents unrealized losses that met the test discussed above for impairment as the declines in value were observed to be small both in amounts and percentage, and therefore, the decline in value for those investments was still determined to be temporary in nature. The percentage of noninvestment grade securities held by Sony Life represents approximately 2 percent of Sony Lifes total investment portfolio, while the percentage of unrealized losses that relate to those noninvestment grade securities was approximately 4 percent of Sony Lifes total unrealized losses as of March 31, 2005. For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Life as of March 31, 2005 (2.1 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year: 18 percent  1 to 5 years: 55 percent  5 to 10 years: 21 percent Sony also maintains long-term investment securities issued by a number of non-public companies. The aggregate carrying amount of these investments in non-public companies at March 31, 2005 was 48.9 billion yen. A non-public equity investment is valued at cost as fair value is not readily determinable. If the value is estimated to have declined and such decline is judged to be other than temporary, impairment of the investment is recognized and the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, total impairment losses were 25.5 billion yen, 16.7 billion yen and 4.2 billion yen of which 2.3 billion yen, 0.2 billion yen and 0.5 billion yen, respectively, were recorded by Sony Life in Financial Services revenue (Refer to Financial Services under Operating Performance by Business Segment for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004). Impairment losses other than at Sony Life in each of the three fiscal years were reflected in non-operating expenses and primarily relate to the certain strategic investments in non-financial services businesses. These investments primarily relate to the certain strategic investments in Japan, the U.S. and Europe with which Sony has strategic relationships for the purposes of developing and marketing new technologies. The impairment losses were recorded for each of the three fiscal years as these companies failed to successfully develop and market such technology, the operating performance of the companies was more unfavorable than previously expected and the decline in fair value of these companies was judged as other-than-temporary. None of these impairment losses was individually material to Sony, except for the devaluation of securities explained in Other Income and Expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003. Upon determination that the value of an investment is impaired, the value of the investment is written down to its fair value. For publicly traded investments, fair value is determined by the closing stock price as of the date on which the impairment determination is made. For non-public investments, fair value is determined through the use of such methodologies as discounted cash flows, valuation of recent financings and comparable valuations of similar companies. The impairment losses that were recorded in each of the three fiscal years related to the unique facts and circumstances of each individual investment and did not significantly impact other investments. Sony Life and Sony Banks investments constitute the majority of the investments in the Financial Services segment. Sony Life and Sony Bank account for approximately 84 percent and 14 percent of the investments of the Financial Services segment, respectively. Sony Lifes basic investment policy is to take both expected returns and investment risks into account in order to maintain sound asset quality, structuring its asset management portfolio to ensure steady medium- and long-term returns by investing assets in an efficient manner and responding flexibly to changes in financial conditions and the investment environment. Moreover, Sony Life analyzes the character of future insurance policy benefits by utilizing Asset Liability Management (ALM), a method of managing interest rate fluctuation risk through the comprehensive identification of the mismatches of duration and cash flows between assets and liabilities. Government bonds, convertible bonds, and straight corporate bonds constitute a majority of Sony Lifes current portfolio. Sony Life invests in various types of bonds in many countries, 65 Table of Contents companies and industries, to diversify associated risks. Stocks accounted for approximately 3 percent of the current portfolio. Sony Bank operates using a similar basic investment policy as Sony Life, taking expected returns and investment risks into account in order to disperse associated risks, and structuring its asset portfolio to ensure steady returns from investments. In addition, Sony Bank is careful to match the duration of its asset portfolio with the duration of liabilities resulting from customer deposits, in order to ensure that significant discrepancies do not occur. Government bonds and corporate bonds in yen or other currencies constitute a majority of Sony Banks current portfolio. To safeguard its assets Sony Bank does not invest in equity securities but invests in various types of government and corporate bonds in many countries, companies and industries, to diversify associated risks. With respect to loans, Sony Bank mainly offers housing loans to individuals and does not have any corporate loan exposure. Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Contingent Liabilities The following table summarizes Sonys contractual obligations and major commitments. Please note that references to Notes below are references to particular notes within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 to After Total 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 5 Year (Yen in millions) Contractual Obligations and Major Commitments:* Long-term debt (Note 11) Capital lease obligations (Notes 8 and 11) 40,301 11,713 17,435 6,655 4,498 Other long-term debt (Note 11) 805,561 155,157 192,741 278,684 178,979 Minimum rental payments required under operating leases (Note 8) 169,951 38,182 53,561 24,556 53,652 Purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment and other assets (Note 23) 83,683 67,698 15,973 12  Expected cost for the production or purchase of films and television programming or certain rights (Note 23) 82,080 45,651 36,429   * The total amount of expected future pension payments is not included in the above table or the total amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2005 discussed below as such amount is not currently determinable. Sony expects to contribute approximately 35.0 billion yen to the Japanese pension plans and approximately 6.0 billion yen to the foreign pension plans for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006 (Note 14). * The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under loan agreements in the Financial Services segment is not included in the above table or the amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2005 discussed below as it is not foreseeable how many loans will be executed. The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under these contracts was 199.9 billion yen as of March 31, 2005 (Note 23). * The 5 year Revolving Credit Agreement with Sony BMG, which matures on August 5, 2009 and provides for a base commitment of 32.1 billion yen and additional incremental borrowings of up to 16.1 billion yen, is not included in the above table or the amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2005 discussed below as such amount is not currently determinable. Sonys outstanding commitment under this Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2005 was 24.1 billion yen (Note 23). 66 Table of Contents The total amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2005 was 240.7 billion yen (Refer to Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The commitments include major purchase obligations as shown above. In the ordinary course of business, Sony makes commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. As of March 31, 2005, such commitments outstanding were 83.7 billion yen. A subsidiary in the Pictures segment has committed to fund a portion of the production cost of completed films and is responsible for all distribution and marketing expenses relating to these films under a distribution agreement with a third party. Further, certain subsidiaries in the Pictures segment have entered into agreements with creative talent for the development and production of films and television programming as well as agreements with third parties to acquire completed films, or certain rights therein. As of March 31, 2005, the total amount of the expected cost for the production or purchase of films and television programming or certain rights under the above commitments was 82.1 billion yen. In order to fulfill its commitments, Sony will use cash generated by its operating activities, intra-group loans and borrowings from subsidiaries with excess funds to subsidiaries that are short of funds through its finance subsidiaries such as SGTS, and raise funds from the global capital markets and from banks when necessary. The following table summarizes Sonys contingent liabilities. Total Amounts of Contingent Liabilities (Yen in millions) Contingent Liabilities: (Notes 23) Loan guarantees to related parties 7,642 Other 18,407 Total contingent liabilities 26,049 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Sony has several accounts receivable securitization programs to provide liquidity, capital resources and credit risk support. In the United States, Sony has set up an accounts receivable securitization program that provides for the accelerated receipt of up to 53.5 billion yen of cash on eligible trade accounts receivable of Sonys U.S. electronics subsidiary. Through this program, Sony can securitize and sell a percentage of an undivided interest in that pool of receivables to several multi-seller commercial paper conduits owned and operated by a bank. These securitization transactions are accounted for as a sale in accordance with FAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, accounts receivable sold under these transactions are excluded from receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. During the period from April 2004 to January 2005, Sony sold a total of 80.3 billion yen of accounts receivable under this program. There were no outstanding amounts due at March 31, 2005 relating to the existing undivided interests in the pool of receivables that had been sold. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. This program was terminated in May 2005. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony entered into new accounts receivable sales programs that provide for the accelerated receipt of up to 47.5 billion yen of eligible trade accounts receivable of Sony Corporation. Through these programs, Sony can sell receivables to special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. These transactions are accounted for as a sale in accordance with FAS No. 140, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, accounts receivable sold under these transactions are excluded from receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The initial sale of these receivables was in March 2005, and Sony sold a total of 10.0 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. Although Sony continues servicing the sold 67 Table of Contents receivables, no servicing liabilities are recorded because costs regarding collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Sony has, from time to time, entered into various financing arrangements with Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). These arrangements include facilities which provide for the leasing of certain property, the financing of film production and the development and operation of a multi-use real estate complex. Although not a significant part of its financing activities, Sony employs these arrangements because they provide a diversification of funding sources. The assets and liabilities associated with these arrangements previously qualified for off-balance sheet treatment. On July 1, 2003, Sony adopted FIN 46 and accordingly, the assets and liabilities associated with these arrangements were consolidated. Refer to Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. As a result, Sony recognized a one time charge with no tax effect of 2.1 billion yen for cumulative effect of an accounting change for the year ended March 31, 2004. Additionally, Sonys assets and liabilities increased as non-cash transactions, which resulted in no cash flows, by 95.3 billion yen and 98.0 billion yen, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2005, also increased by 1.5 billion yen compared with previous fiscal year-end. As of March 31, 2005, Sony is a primary beneficiary for all the VIEs in which Sony holds a significant variable interest, and all these VIEs are consolidated by Sony. Also, in connection with Sonys utilization of joint venture and alliances to achieve certain strategic objectives, Sony has recently entered into several joint ventures and made certain strategic investments which include SONY BMG, S-LCD and MGM. Sony has reviewed these investments and determined that both SONY BMG and S-LCD are not VIEs while MGM is a VIE. However, MGM will not be consolidated as Sony is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE. Accordingly, Sony has accounted for these investments under the equity method. Cash Flows (The fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004) Operating Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony generated 647.0 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a increase of 14.4 billion yen, or 2.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment generated 485.4 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a increase of 84.3 billion yen, or 21.0 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment generated 168.1 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of 73.5 billion yen, or 30.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, in addition to profit contributions from the Pictures, Financial Services, Game and Music segments and depreciation expenses, operating cash flow benefited from an increase in notes and accounts payable, trade, primarily associated with an increase in sales and procurement related primarily to the PlayStation Portable within the Game segment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, a decrease in notes and accounts receivable, trade, associated with a sales decrease in the Pictures segment during the fourth quarter and within the Music segment associated with the decrease in sales after August 2004, and a decrease in inventory mainly within the Game and Electronics segments. Partially offsetting these contributions were factors including an increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade primarily within the Game segment. In addition, in the Financial Services segment, an increase in future insurance policy benefits and other, due to an increase in insurance-in-force, contributed to operating cash flow in the Financial Services segment. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities increased, due to a decrease in inventory during the fiscal year compared to an increase in inventory in the previous fiscal year, and there was a smaller increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade, compared with the previous fiscal year associated with the decrease in sales. These factors were partially offset by factors such as a smaller increase in notes and accounts payable, trade. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year, Sony used 931.2 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 169.4 billion yen, or 22.2 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all 68 Table of Contents segments excluding the Financial Services segment used 472.1 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 119.6 billion yen, or 33.9 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment used 421.4 billion yen in net cash, an increase of 19.8 billion yen, or 4.9 percent. During the fiscal year, purchases of fixed assets (capital expenditures) were made, primarily due to proactive capital expenditures in semiconductors mainly within the Electronics segment, mostly associated with system LSI including the advanced microprocessor Cell, as well as investments associated with the establishment of the amorphous TFT LCD panel manufacturing joint venture S-LCD. Within the Financial Services segment, payments for investments and advances exceeded proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances primarily as a result of both investments in mainly Japanese fixed income securities resulting from an increase in insurance premiums at Sony Life, and a housing loan campaign carried out at Sony Bank. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities increased, due primarily to investments associated with S-LCD. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the amount of payments for investments and advances increased by 124.8 billion yen from 33.3 billion yen to 158.2 billion yen due to the abovementioned investments at S-LCD. On the other hand, in the Financial Services segment, net cash used in investing activities increased due to an increase in proceeds from investments and advances year on year. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the difference between cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities was 13.3 billion yen for the fiscal year, a decrease of 35.3 billion yen, or 72.6 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, 205.2 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities. Of the total, 95.4 billion yen of net cash was used for financing activities in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment as a result of 89.7 billion yen being used for the repayment of long term debt and 23.0 billion yen in cash being used for the payment of dividends. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, net cash was used for financing activities compared to 153.8 billion yen of net cash procured in the previous fiscal year. This change was due mainly to the issuance of 250.0 billion yen in euro yen convertible bonds (bonds with stock acquisition rights) within the previous fiscal year. In the Financial Services segment, as a result of a 294.4 billion yen increase in customer deposits due to factors such as an increase in insurance-in-force at Sony Life and an increase in deposits from customers in the banking business, 256.4 billion yen was procured by financing activities. Accounting for all these factors and the effect of exchange rate changes, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year decreased by 70.1 billion yen, or 8.3 percent, to 779.1 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. The total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 73.2 billion yen, or 12.3 percent, to 519.7 billion yen, and for the Financial Services segment, increased by 3.1 billion, or 1.2 percent, to 259.4 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. Condensed Statements of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of cash flow for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment as well as condensed consolidated statements of cash flow. These presentations are not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements.

Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment generated 401.1 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of 143.0 billion yen, or 26.3 percent, compared with the previous year, and the Financial Services segment generated 241.6 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of 73.1 billion yen, or 23.2 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. 70 Table of Contents During the fiscal year, profits from the Game, Financial Services, Pictures and Music segments, an increase in depreciation expenses, and an increase in notes and accounts payable, trade, primarily due to an increase in the procurement of raw materials and parts reflecting the increase in sales to outside customers in the Electronics segment, contributed to operating cash flow. Partially offsetting these contributions were factors including an increase in inventories in the Electronics segment and an increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade in the Electronics and Pictures segments. An increase in future insurance policy benefits and other, due to an increase in insurance-in-force, contributed to operating cash flow in the Financial Services segment. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities decreased, due to a year on year increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, compared with a year on year decrease during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. The increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade was primarily due to an increase in sales to outside customers, in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004, of digital still cameras, flat panel televisions and cellular phones (sold to Sony Ericsson) in the Electronics segment, as well as home entertainment revenues in the Pictures segment, compared with the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2003. Although certain factors contributed to an increase in operating cash flow, such as a year on year increase, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, in notes and accounts payable, trade, compared with a year on year decrease in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, mainly due to the increase in the procurement of raw materials and parts reflecting the increase in sales to outside customers in the Electronics segment, these factors were offset by factors such as an increase in inventories in the Electronics segment during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 compared with a decrease in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, which decreased operating cash flow. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year, Sony used 761.8 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 55.4 billion yen, or 7.8 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment used 352.5 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 166.6 billion yen, or 89.6 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment used 401.6 billion yen in net cash, a decrease of 115.1 billion yen, or 22.3 percent. During the fiscal year, purchases of fixed assets (capital expenditures) were made, primarily due to proactive capital expenditures in the Electronics and Game segments mainly for next generation broadband microprocessors and CCDs, and payments for investments and advances exceeded proceeds in the Financial Services segment due to an increase in assets under management (Refer to Financial Services). Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities increased due to an increase in purchases of fixed assets, primarily in the Electronics and Game segments. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the amount of payments for investments and advances decreased by 90.5 billion yen, or 73.1 percent, to 33.3 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year, due to investments associated with the acquisition of companies such as InterTrust Technologies Corporation and an increase in the capital stock of Sony Ericsson in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. On the other hand, the amount of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and collections of advances in the segments other than Financial Services segment decreased 113.5 billion yen, or 76.2 percent to 35.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, due to the sale of Sonys equity interest in Telemundo in the previous fiscal year. In the Financial Services segment, net cash used in investing activities decreased due to an increase in proceeds from investments and advances. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the difference between cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities was a positive 48.6 billion yen for the fiscal year, a decrease of 309.6 billion yen, or 86.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, 313.3 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities (in the previous fiscal year, 93.1 billion yen of net cash was procured through financing activities in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment. Although 23.1 billion yen in cash was used for the payment of dividends and 52.8 billion yen in commercial paper was repaid, 250.0 billion yen in euro yen convertible bonds (bonds with stock acquisition rights) were issued. In 71 Table of Contents the Financial Services segment, due to factors such as a 129.9 billion yen increase in deposits from customers in the banking business, net cash provided by financing activities was 141.7 billion yen. Accounting for all these factors and the effect of exchange rate changes, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year increased 136.2 billion yen, or 19.1 percent, to 849.2 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. The total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased 154.4 billion yen, or 35.2 percent, to 592.9 billion yen and for the Financial Services segment decreased 18.2 billion, or 6.6 percent, to 256.3 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. Condensed Statements of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of cash flow for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment as well as condensed consolidated statements of cash flow. These presentations are not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. All other segments excluding Financial Services Financial Services Consolidated Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 (Yen in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 314,764 241,627 544,051 401,090 853,788 632,635 Net cash used in investing activities (516,663 ) (401,550 ) (185,883 ) (352,496 ) (706,425 ) (761,792 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 149,207 141,696 (251,247 ) 153,759 (93,134 ) 313,283 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (24,971 ) (47,973 ) (24,971 ) (47,973 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (52,692 ) (18,227 ) 81,950 154,380 29,258 136,153 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the fiscal year 327,235 274,543 356,565 438,515 683,800 713,058 Cash and cash equivalents at end of the fiscal year 274,543 256,316 438,515 592,895 713,058 849,211 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sonys financial policy is to secure adequate liquidity and financing for its operations and to maintain the strength of its balance sheet. Sony intends to continue both structural reform and investment for future growth in several segments. Sony believes that it can maintain sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to satisfy its various capital needs, including the funding requirements that arise from this business strategy, working capital needs, repayment of existing debt, payment of dividend and all its other capital needs, through operating cash flows and cash and cash equivalents, its ability to procure necessary funds from the financial and capital markets, its commitment lines with banks, and other means. 72 Table of Contents Market Access Sony Corporation and SGTS, a finance subsidiary in the U.K., procure funds from the financial and capital markets. In order to meet long-term funding requirements, Sony Corporation utilizes its access to global equity and bond markets and did not issue any stock or bonds during the fiscal year. Sony has a shelf registration of 300 billion yen in the Japanese domestic bond market, of which no bonds were issued as of March 31, 2005. In order to meet the working capital requirements of Sony, SGTS maintains commercial paper (CP) programs and a medium-term note (MTN) program. SGTS maintains CP programs for the U.S., Euro and Japanese CP markets. As of March 31, 2005, the total amount of these CP programs was 1,251.5 billion yen. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the largest month-end outstanding balance of CP at SGTS was 122.5 billion yen in November 2004. There was no outstanding balance of CP as of March 31, 2005. SGTS maintains a Euro MTN program of whose total program amount as of March 31, 2005 was 536.8 billion yen. There was no outstanding balance as of March 31, 2005. Sony Capital Corporation (SCC), a Sony finance subsidiary in the U.S., had an outstanding MTN balance of approximately 58.8 billion yen as of March 31, 2005. However, Sony does not intend to utilize SCCs program for future financing requirements as SCCs financing function was integrated into that of SGTS. Liquidity Management Sony defines its liquidity sources as the amount of cash, cash equivalents (cash balance), and committed lines of credit contracted with financial institutions. Working capital needs of Sony shows general seasonality to grow significantly in the third quarter (from October to December). In Sonys liquidity management, it is basic policy to secure sufficient liquidity throughout the relevant fiscal year, covering such factors as short-term cash flow volatility mentioned above, repayments for debts whose due date come within the fiscal year, and possible downward earnings risk due to business environment change. Sony has a policy to keep more than a certain level of cash balance to absorb any working capital needs daily and monthly. The cash balance on March 31, 2005, was 523.8 billion yen. A short-term shortage in the cash balance is financed by the issuance of CP. However, Sony controls the outstanding CP amount through internal limits as part of its short-term debt risk management strategy. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, there was no outstanding CP amount. As part of its additional liquidity sources, Sony has a total of 868.7 billion yen in committed lines of credit, of which the unused amount was approximately 863.9 billion yen as of March 31, 2005. Major committed lines of credit include 574.3 billion yen of the Global Commitment Facilities contracted with a syndicate of global banks, and 250 billion yen of committed lines of credit contracted with a syndicate of Japanese banks. There has been no major change since the last fiscal year in terms of the total amount and composition of the committed lines of credit. Sony uses these lines for general corporate purposes, including the support of commercial paper programs and for emergency purposes. There are no financial covenants in any of Sonys material financial agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in Sonys credit ratings. However, a downgrade in Sonys credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings. There are no restrictions on how Sonys borrowings can be used except that some borrowings may not be used to acquire securities listed on a U.S. exchange or traded over-the-counter in U.S., and use of such borrowings must comply with the rules and regulations issued by authorities such as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. Ratings Sony considers it to be one of managements top priorities to maintain a stable and appropriate credit rating in order to ensure financial flexibility for liquidity and capital management, and to continue to maintain adequate access to sufficient funding resources in the financial and capital markets. 73 Table of Contents In order to facilitate access to global capital markets, Sony obtains credit ratings from two rating agencies, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Standard and Poors Rating Services (S&P). In addition, Sony maintains a rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), a rating agency in Japan, for access to the Japanese capital market. Sonys current debt ratings from each agency are noted below: Moodys S&P R&I Long-term debt A1 (Outlook: Negative) A (Outlook: Negative) AA Short-term debt P-1 A-1 a-1+ On November 22, 2004, S&P downgraded Sonys long-term debt rating from A+ to A (outlook: negative). This action reflected the concerns of S&P that it is uncertain if Sony will strengthen and stabilize its profitability particularly in the electronics business, under the severe competition and deflationary pressures. Sonys short-term debt rating from S&P has been unaffected. Despite the downgrading of Sonys long-term debt rating by S&P, Sony believes its access to the global capital markets and ability to issue CP for its working capital needs has not been limited. Cash Management Sony is centralizing and working to make more efficient its global cash management activities through SGTS. The excess or shortage of cash at most of Sonys subsidiaries is invested or funded by SGTS after having been netted out, although Sony recognizes that fund transfers are limited in certain countries and geographical areas due to restrictions on capital transactions. In order to pursue more efficient cash management, Sony manages uneven cash distribution among its subsidiaries directly or indirectly through SGTS so that Sony can reduce unnecessary cash and cash equivalents as well as borrowings as much as possible. The above description covers liquidity and capital resources for consolidated Sony excluding the Financial Services segment which secure liquidity on their own. Financial Services segment In the Financial Services segment, the management of SFH, Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank recognize the importance of securing sufficient liquidity to cover the payment obligations that they take on as a result of their ordinary course of business, and these companies abide by the regulations imposed by regulatory authorities and establish and operate under company guidelines that comply with these regulations. Their purpose in doing so is to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and secure sufficient means to pay their obligations. For instance, Sony Lifes cash inflows come mainly from policyholders insurance premiums and Sony Life keeps sufficient liquidity in the form of investments primarily in various securities. Sony Bank, on the other hand, uses its cash inflows, which come mainly from customers deposits in local or foreign currencies, in order to offer housing loans to individuals or to make bond investments, and establish a necessary level of liquidity for the smooth settlement of transactions. Sony Life currently obtains ratings from four rating agencies: A+ by S&P both for long-term local currency issuer ratings and insurance and finance capability ratings, A+ by AM Best Corporation for insurance and finance capability ratings, and AA by R&I and the Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd for insurance claim payment capabilities ratings. Sony Bank obtained an A-/ A-2 rating from S&P for its long-term/short-term local/foreign currency issuer ratings. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Recognizing that research and development are indispensable for business growth, Sony has established semiconductors, displays, and optical technologies, and related devices, as focus areas for research and development and is devoting its energies to the development of a variety of strategic devices and innovative new products as part of research and development activities within the Network Companies and business 74 Table of Contents groups. Moreover, a Technology Round Table has been set up to facilitate the selection, consolidation and convergence of themes for research and development, for the sharing and validation of research and development roadmaps and to frame research and development strategy. In addition, while continually endeavoring to improve product quality, Sony is also striving to develop products that are even more environmentally-friendly. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony received a special commendation and award from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan for excellence in the utilization of biomass as a result of Sonys technological development and proactive implementation of vegetable-based plastics in home electronic appliances. Sony continues to strengthen the basic research and development structure at two of its corporate laboratories, the Material Laboratories and the Information Technology Laboratories. These laboratories closely collaborate with the research and development activities carried out by the network companies, with the aim of forging new future markets. In addition, Sony operates three independent research laboratories; Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (focusing on fundamental research and user interface research); Sony-Kihara Research Center, Inc. (focusing on three-dimensional computer graphics and image processing technologies); and Sony Intelligence Dynamics Laboratories, Inc. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased 12.5 billion yen, or 2.4 percent, to 502.0 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (excluding the Financial Services segment) increased from 7.5 percent to 7.6 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment increased 2.4 billion yen, or 0.5 percent, to 432.8 billion yen, and expenses in the Game segment decreased 14.9 billion yen, or 17.9 percent, to 68.5 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 62 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 38 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications, displays and next generation optical discs. There was an increase in research and development costs related to semiconductor process technology associated with the transfer of Sony Computer Entertainments semiconductor manufacturing operations from the Game segment to the Electronics segment. However, the stringent selection of research and development activities resulted in a small increase in research and development expenses within the Electronics segment. Research and development expenses in the Game segment remained high due to the research and development associated with PlayStation Portable and PLAYSTATION 3. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased 71.4 billion yen, or 16 percent, to 514.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (excluding the Financial Services segment) increased from 6.4 percent to 7.5 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment increased 49.2 billion yen, or 12.9 percent, to 430.5 billion yen, and expenses in the Game segment increased 21.9 billion yen, or 35.7 percent, to 83.4 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 62 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining approximately 38 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications, displays and next generation optical discs. Research and development costs in the Game segment increased primarily in the semiconductor and hardware fields, with network technology accounting for part of the increase in the hardware area. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 were 443.1 billion yen. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments; expenses in the Electronics segment were 381.2 billion yen, and expenses in the Game segment increased 61.5 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 66 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining approximately 34 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications, and displays. TREND INFORMATION This section, including the Forecast of Consolidated Results, contains forward-looking statements about the possible future performance of Sony and should be read in light of the cautionary statement on that subject, which appears on the inside front cover page and which applies to this entire document. 75 Table of Contents Issues Facing Sony and Managements Response to those Issues Competition in many of Sonys business segments continues to intensify and price erosion, especially in the Electronics segment, remains persistent. Competition has intensified due to the penetration of broadband, which has led to an augmentation of network infrastructure, making it easier for companies in other sectors to enter the markets in which Sony competes. In response to these challenges, over the three fiscal years ending March 31, 2006, Sony is implementing Transformation 60, a series of fundamental reforms aimed at improving operational profitability and competitiveness in anticipation of future growth. Through greater focus of management resources on strategic businesses, accelerated reform of its manufacturing platform, headcount reductions in administrative (including corporate) and sales functions and reductions in the cost of non-production materials, Sony intends to reduce fixed costs. (See Restructuring in Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects for more detailed information about restructuring). Sony also aims to lay the seeds for future growth through strategic investments in research and development, as well as aggressive capital expenditures in the area of semiconductors. In addition to this cost-cutting and investment for growth, each of Sonys business segments grappled with issues specific to that segment. Below is a description of the issues management believes each segment continues to face and an explanation as to how each segment is approaching those issues. Electronics Although the Electronics segment continues to hold a very strong position in the worldwide consumer audio visual products market, that position has become increasingly threatened as a result of the entrance of new manufacturers and distributors. These new entrants are threatening Sonys position due to the industry shift from analog to digital technology. In the analog era, complicated functionality of electronics products was made possible through the combination of several complex parts, and Sony held a competitive advantage in the design and manufacture of those parts as a result of its accumulated expertise. In the digital era, however, complicated functionality has become concentrated on semiconductors and other key digital devices. Since these semiconductors and key devices are able to be mass produced, they have become readily available to new market entrants, and the functionality that once commanded a high premium has become more affordable. This has led to intense price erosion in the end-user consumer audio visual products market. To respond to these challenges, Sony is striving to keep pace with price erosion by reducing its manufacturing and other costs. It is seeking to maintain the premium pricing it enjoys on many of its end-user products by adding functionality to those products and developing new applications and ways of use that are then communicated to the consumer. In addition, it is taking steps to increase its competitive edge by developing high value-added semiconductors and other digital key devices in-house. By increasing the ratio of key devices produced in-house, Sony aims to capture the value that has become increasingly concentrated in those devices. In the area of semiconductors, in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2005, Sony carried out 175 billion yen and 150 billion yen, respectively, of capital expenditure mainly on system large scale integrations (LSI) and CCDs. Of this, Sony invested 69 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and invested 90 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 on semiconductor fabrication equipment built at the 65 nanometer level of process technology. Chips that will be manufactured using this equipment will be some of the most highly advanced on the market, and will include the new microprocessor for the broadband era, Cell, as well as other system LSI for use in the next generation computer entertainment system, PLAYSTATION 3 and a variety of future consumer electronics products. Sony began developing Cell together with IBM Corporation and Toshiba Corporation in the spring of 2001. In July 2004, in order to establish a more efficient and coordinated semiconductor supply structure, Sony has integrated its semiconductor manufacturing business by transferring Sony Computer Entertainments semiconductor manufacturing operation from the Game segment to the semiconductor category within the Electronics segment. In the area of other key devices, Sony invested in 7th generation amorphous TFT LCD panel production equipment, through a one billion U.S. dollar investment in S-LCD, a joint venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. based in South Korea. This investment reflects Sonys belief that demand for LCD televisions will 76 Table of Contents continue to increase rapidly. Samsung holds 50 percent plus one share of the equity of the joint venture while Sony holds 50 percent minus one share of the equity of the joint venture. The President and CEO comes from Samsung while the CFO comes from Sony. Production of LCD panels began in April 2005. Expected production capacity is 60,000 sheets per month at the 7th generation (1,870 mm x 2,200 mm) level of technology. Game In the Game segment, PS2 has a high share of the global game console market, and the PS2 business, particularly the PS2 software business, remains in its harvest stage. However, production shipment units of PS2 hardware are expected to decrease in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006. In order to ensure future growth in the Game segment, Sony is investing, as described above, in the research and development of cutting-edge microprocessors and other LSIs that will be used in the next generation computer entertainment system, PLAYSTATION 3. Furthermore, Sony is working to develop a new market through its introduction of PlayStation Portable, a new handheld video game system on which a variety of content can be enjoyed. PlayStation Portable was introduced in Japan and U.S. in December 2004 and March 2005, respectively and will be introduced in Europe in September 2005. Music Within the music industry, album sales over the past several years have decreased due to piracy and competition from other entertainment sectors. One way Sony is working to combat digital piracy and generate profits is through the digital distribution of content, is through its launch of the Connect music store, a digital downloading service, which is now classified as part of the Other segment. As part of an effort to achieve significant operational efficiencies, Sony merged its recorded music business, excluding its recorded music business in Japan, with the recorded music business of Bertelsmann AG in August 2004, forming the joint venture SONY BMG. The newly formed company is 50 percent owned by each parent company and is accounted for by Sony under the equity method. Pictures In the Pictures segment, Sony faces intense competition, rising advertising and promotion expenses and a growing trend toward digital piracy. To meet these challenges, Sony is working to distribute a diversified portfolio of motion pictures and capitalize on the expanding DVD home entertainment market, which is becoming a more significant source of revenues and profits. One of the ways that Sony is working to distribute a diversified portfolio of motion pictures and capitalize on the expanding DVD home entertainment market is through its participation in the acquisition of MGM. In conjunction with the transaction, SPE entered into agreements to co-finance and produce new motion pictures with MGM and to distribute MGMs existing film and television content in, among other markets, the DVD home entertainment market. Financial Services In the Financial Services segment, the value of assets accumulated by the businesses in the segment has grown continuously over the past several fiscal years, resulting in a large portion (approximately 40 percent) of Sonys total assets being accounted for by the Financial Services segment. To strengthen asset management and risk management in parallel with this growing asset value, enhance disclosure of business details, and offer customers integrated financial services tailored to their individual needs, in April 2004 Sony established Sony Financial Holdings Inc., a holding company comprised of Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank, with the aim of both increasing the synergies between these businesses and targeting an initial public offering during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. Forecast of Consolidated Results Factors which may affect Sonys financial performance include the following: market conditions, including general economic conditions, in major areas where Sony conducts its businesses, levels of consumer 77 Table of Contents spending, foreign exchange fluctuations, Sonys ability to continue to design, develop, manufacture, sell, and win acceptance of its products and services, Sonys ability to continue to implement personnel reductions and other business reorganization initiatives, Sonys ability to implement its network strategy, and implement successful sales and distribution strategies in the light of the Internet and other technological developments, Sonys ability to devote sufficient resources to research and development, and capital expenditures, and the success of Sonys joint ventures and alliances. Risks and uncertainties also include the impact of any future events with material unforeseen impacts. Refer also to the Cautionary Statement. Regarding the forecast of consolidated results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, sales and operating revenue, operating income, and income before income taxes are expected to increase compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Net income is expected to decrease. This forecast assumes that the yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006 will strengthen against the U.S. dollar and the euro compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. During the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, restructuring charges, primarily in the Electronics segment, of approximately 72 billion yen are expected to be incurred across Sony as a whole. 90 billion yen of restructuring charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. The forecast for operating income and income before income taxes reflects an estimated gain of approximately 60 billion yen related to the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion, the benefit obligation related to past employee service, of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Furthermore, 35 billion yen of this estimated gain is reflected in the forecast for net income after deductions for the effect of income taxes. In June 6, 2005, SCN sold 17,935 shares of So-Net M3 Inc., at 694,600 yen per share with a total value of 12,458 million yen. As a result of this sale, Sony records approximately 11.9 billion yen gain on the sale of its stock for the year ending March 31, 2006, and Sonys ownership interest has been reduced from 74.8 percent to 60.8 percent. As of March 31, 2005, Sony had deferred tax assets on tax loss carry forwards in relation to Japanese local income taxes totaling 77.5 billion yen. However, there is a possibility that, depending on future operating performance, Sony may establish a valuation allowance against part or all of its deferred tax assets that would be charged to income as an increase in tax expense. However, the forecast above does not include this possibility. The forecast for each business segment (excluding the anticipated gain from the transfer of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund) is as follows: Electronics Sales are expected to increase primarily due to an increase in the sales of products such as flat panel televisions and LCD rear projection televisions. With regard to operating performance, although an improvement is expected due to the increase in sales and a reduction in fixed costs relating to restructuring implemented during the previous fiscal year, a decline in unit prices, appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and euro and increase in both depreciation and amortization and research and development costs are also anticipated. An improvement in operating performance is expected, reflecting the abovementioned factors, as well as an anticipated reduction in restructuring charges. Game Sales are expected to increase due to the contribution from both PlayStation Portable hardware and software. Although PS2 and PlayStation Portable are expected to contribute to operating income, increased research and development costs primarily for PLAYSTATION 3 are expected to leave operating income relatively unchanged. 78 Table of Contents Music Due to the establishment of SONY BMG (Refer to Business Segment Information in Operating Results above) sales are expected to decrease. A small increase in operating income is anticipated. Pictures Although sales are expected to increase due to the impact of SPEs agreements with MGM, operating income is expected to decrease compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, in which Spider-Man 2 was a substantial contributor. Financial Services Although revenue is expected to continue to grow mainly due to an increase in revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life, a small decrease is expected in operating income due to the conservative estimation of insurance claim payments. Capital Expenditures In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, capital expenditures (additions to fixed assets) are expected to be 410 billion yen, an increase of 15 percent compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Approximately 90 percent of the amount is expected to be spent in the Electronics segment. Of this amount, capital expenditures on semiconductors during the fiscal year are expected to amount to 160 billion yen (actual amount in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was 150 billion yen). For an explanation regarding fund procurement, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources above. Depreciation and Amortization In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, expenses for depreciation and amortization, which includes the amortization of intangible assets and the amortization of deferred insurance acquisition costs, are expected to be 390 billion yen, an increase of 5 percent compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Both expenses for the amortization of deferred insurance acquisition costs in the Financial Services segment and expenses for depreciation and amortization in the Electronics segment are expected to increase. Research and Development Sony expects research and development costs (total of expenses for the development of new product prototypes and expenses for the development of mid-to long-term new technologies) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006 to be 520 billion yen, a 4 percent increase compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Research and development costs for both the Electronics and Game segments are expected to increase. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Sony evaluates its estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. Sony considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to its financial condition and results, and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. Sony believes that the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company. 79 Table of Contents Investments Sonys investments are comprised of debt and equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity method of accounting. If it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings. Sony regularly evaluates its investment portfolio to identify other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities. Factors that are considered by Sony in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of credit condition of the issuers, sovereign risk, and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities whose fair values are readily determinable, management presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally a period of up to six to twelve months). This criteria is employed as a threshold to identify securities which may have a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of other factors which overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is not more than 20% or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors which may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary often requires management judgment based on evaluation of relevant factors. Those factors include business plans and future cash flows of the issuer of the security, the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee, and the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that are currently believed to be temporary may determine to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of additional information such as continued poor operating results, future broad declines in value of worldwide equity markets or circumstances in market interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized into income in future periods. Impairment of Long-Lived assets Sony reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets held and used and long-lived assets to be disposed of whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. This review is performed using estimates of future cash flows by product category (e.g. TV display CRTs) or entity (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing division in the U.S.). If the carrying value of the asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations of those long-lived assets. These unforeseen changes include a possible further decline in demand for TV display CRTs due to a shift in demand from CRT displays to LCD and plasma panel displays. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 12.4 billion yen. This included 8.1 billion yen for the impairment of semiconductor and computer display CRT manufacturing equipment to be abandoned or to be sold in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. It also included 2.7 billion yen for the impairment of a CD manufacturing facility in the U.S., the fair value of which was estimated by using methods such as a survey of the local real estate market. 80 Table of Contents In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 16.1 billion yen. This included 5.3 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets such as semiconductor and TV display CRT manufacturing equipment to be abandoned or sold in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. It also included 3.0 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets in the Music segment such as a certain CD manufacturing facility to be abandoned or sold and a recording studio and equipment to be held and used in Japan. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows based on the best information available. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 19.2 billion yen. This included 7.5 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of CRT TV display manufacturing facilities to be held and used in Europe in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows based on the best information available. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are tested for impairment in accordance with FAS No. 142 on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying value. Such an event would include unfavorable variances from established business plans, significant changes in forecasted results or volatility inherent to external markets and industries, which are periodically reviewed by management. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit (generally, Sonys operating segments) with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Other intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could significantly impact whether or not an impairment charge is recognized as well as the magnitude of any such charge. In its impairment review, Sony performs internal valuation analyses or utilizes third-party valuations when management believes it to be appropriate, and considers other market information that is publicly available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analysis. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony performed the annual impairment analysis and no impairment loss has been recognized. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business 81 Table of Contents assumptions could negatively affect the valuations, which may result in Sony recognizing impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in the future. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the impairment analysis, Sony applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. As of March 31, 2005, a 10% hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting units would not have resulted in a material impairment loss. Pension Benefits Costs Employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on certain assumptions including discount rates, retirement rates and mortality rates, which are based upon current statistical data, as well as expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and other factors. Specifically, the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets are two critical assumptions in the determination of periodic pension costs and pension liabilities. Assumptions are evaluated at least annually, or at the time when events occur or circumstances change and these events or changes could have a significant effect on these critical assumptions. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. Therefore, actual results generally affect recognized expenses and the recorded obligations for pensions in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys pension obligations and future expenses. Sonys principal pension plans are its Japanese pension plans. Foreign pension plans are not significant individually with total assets and pension obligations amounting to less than 10% of those of the aggregate of the Japanese pension plans. To determine the benefit obligation of the Japanese pension plans, Sony used a discount rate of 2.3% for its Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2005. The discount rate was determined by using available information about rates of return on high-quality fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit obligation. The 2.3% discount rate represents a 10 basis point decrease from the 2.4% discount rate used for fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and reflects current market interest rate conditions. For Japanese pension plans, a 10 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension costs by approximately 1.2 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, Sony considers the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on various categories of plan assets. For Japanese pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 4.0% and 3.2% as of March 31, 2004 and 2005 respectively. The actual loss on pension plan assets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was 0.1%. Actual results that differ from the expected return on plan assets are accumulated and amortized as a component of pension costs over the average future service period, thereby reducing the year-to-year volatility in pension costs. As of March 31, 2004 and 2005, Sony had unrecognized actuarial losses of 328.5 billion yen and 322.2 billion yen, respectively, including losses related to plan assets. The unrecognized actuarial losses reflect the overall unfavorable performance of equity markets over the past several years and will result in an increase in pension costs as they are recognized. Sony recorded a liability for the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for Japanese pension plans of 149.4 billion yen and 128.6 billion yen as of March 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. This liability represents the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation under Sonys qualified defined benefit pension plans over the fair value of the plans assets. This liability was established by a charge to stockholders equity, resulting in no impact to the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 82 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate and the expected return on pension plan assets, while holding all other assumptions constant, for Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2005: Pre-Tax Pension Equity Change in Assumption PBO Expense (Net of Tax) (Yen in billions) 25 basis point increase/decrease in discount rate -/+45.0 -/+3.0 +/-1.8 25 basis point increase/decrease in expected return on assets  -/+1.3 +/-0.8 Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Sony records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In establishing the appropriate valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (including deferred tax assets on tax loss carry-forwards), all available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered. Information on historical results is supplemented by all currently available information on future years, because realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on whether each tax-filing unit generates sufficient taxable income. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in Sonys approved forecasts of future operations. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets, less valuation allowance, will be realized. Sony applied to file its corporate income tax return under the consolidated tax filing system in Japan beginning with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. Under the consolidated tax filing system, the tax-filing unit consists of Sony Corporation, the ultimate parent company of the Sony Group, and its wholly owned Japanese subsidiaries. The eventual ability to realize the tax benefit of its deferred tax assets is dependent on whether the tax-filing unit as a whole will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. In addition, Sony is subject to local income taxes in Japan. For purposes of local income taxes, each entity is taxed as a stand alone tax filing unit. The eventual ability to realize the tax benefit of deferred tax assets for local income taxes is dependent on whether Sony Corporation and each subsidiary will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. As of March 31, 2005, Sony Corporation had deferred tax assets for local income taxes totaling 77.5 billion yen. The eventual ability to realize the tax benefit of its deferred tax assets is dependent on whether Sony Corporation will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. Management believes that Sony Corporations historical results, when evaluated in connection with relevant qualitative factors and available information concerning its business and industry, provided substantial positive evidence, which outweighs the negative evidence available. However, under recent conditions, management considers that it is possible that Sony Corporations future results may yield sufficient negative evidence to support the future determination that it is more likely than not that Sony Corporation will not realize the tax benefit of all these deferred tax assets. If this is the case, subject to review of relevant qualitative factors and uncertainties, Sony may establish a valuation allowance against part or all of the deferred tax assets of Sony Corporation. Such valuation allowances would be charged to income as an increase in tax expense. Film Accounting An aspect of film accounting that requires the exercise of judgment relates to the process of estimating the total revenues to be received throughout a films life cycle. Such estimate of a films ultimate revenue is important for two reasons. First, while a film is being produced and the related costs are being capitalized, it is necessary for management to estimate the ultimate revenue, less additional costs to be incurred, including exploitation costs which are expensed as incurred, in order to determine whether the value of a film has been impaired and thus requires an immediate write off of unrecoverable film costs. Second, the amount of film costs recognized as cost of sales for a given film as it is exhibited in various markets throughout its life cycle is based upon the proportion that current period actual revenues bear to the estimated ultimate total revenues. 83 Table of Contents Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on several factors including the historical performance of similar genre films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses, the expected number of theaters at which the film will be released, anticipated performance in the home entertainment, television and other ancillary markets, and agreements for future sales. Management updates such estimates based on the actual results to date of each film. For example, a film that has resulted in lower than expected theatrical revenues in its initial weeks of release would generally have its theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution ultimate revenues adjusted downward; a failure to do so would result in the understatement of amortized film costs for the period. Since the total film cost to be amortized for a given film is fixed, the estimate of ultimate revenues impacts only the timing of film cost amortization. Future Insurance Policy Benefits Liabilities for future insurance policy benefits are established in amounts adequate to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force. These liabilities are computed by the net level premium method based upon estimates as to future investment yield, morbidity, mortality, withdrawals and other factors. Future policy benefits are computed using interest rates ranging from approximately 1.30% to 5.20%. Mortality, morbidity and withdrawal assumptions for all policies are based on either the life insurance subsidiarys own experience or various actuarial tables. Generally these assumptions are locked-in upon the issuance of new insurance. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys future insurance policy benefits. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts In July 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AcSEC) issued the Statement of Position (SOP) 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts. SOP 03-1 requires insurance enterprises to record additional reserves for long-duration life insurance contracts with minimum guarantee or annuity receivable options. Additionally, SOP 03-1 provides guidance for the presentation of separate accounts. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2003. Sony adopted SOP 03-1 on April 1, 2004. As a result of the adoption of SOP 03-1, Sonys operating income decreased by 5.2 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Additionally, on April 1, 2004, Sony recorded a 4.7 billion yen charge (net of income taxes of 2.7 billion yen) as a cumulative effect of an accounting change. In addition, the separate account assets, which are defined by insurance business law in Japan and were previously included in Securities investments and other in the consolidated balance sheet, were excluded from the category of separate accounts under the provision of SOP 03-1. Accordingly, the assets previously treated as separate account assets are now treated within general account assets. The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share In July 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 128, Earnings per Share, Sony had not previously included in the computation of diluted earnings per share (EPS) the number of potential common stock issuable upon the conversion of contingently convertible debt instruments (Co-Cos) that had not met the conditions to exercise the stock acquisition rights. EITF Issue No. 04-8 requires that the maximum number of common stock that could be issued upon the conversion of Co-Cos be included in diluted EPS computations from the date of issuance regardless of whether the conditions to exercise the stock acquisition rights have been met. EITF Issue No. 04-8 is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. Sony adopted EITF Issue No. 04-8 during the quarter ended December 31, 2004. As a result of the adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-8, Sonys diluted EPS of income before cumulative effect of an accounting change and net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 were restated respectively. Sonys diluted EPS of income before 84 Table of Contents cumulative effect of an accounting change and net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were decreased by 7.26 yen and 7.06 yen, respectively, compared to those before adopting EITF Issue No. 04-8. Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (FAS No. 132(R)), which revised FAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, FAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, and FAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. FAS No. 132(R) revised employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It did not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by FAS No. 87, 88 and 106. While retaining the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 132, FAS No. 132(R) requires additional disclosures about assets, obligations and cash flows. The provisions of FAS No. 132(R) were generally effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, excluding the disclosure of certain information about foreign plans. The information about foreign plans is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. In accordance with FAS No. 132(R), Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14, Pension and severance plans, has been expanded to include the new disclosures. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN No. 46 addresses consolidation by a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). Sony early adopted the provisions of FIN No. 46 on July 1, 2003. As a result of adopting the original FIN No. 46, Sony recognized a one-time charge with no tax effect of 2.1 billion yen as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of income, and Sonys assets and liabilities increased by 95.3 billion yen and 98.0 billion yen, respectively. These increases were treated as non-cash transactions in the consolidated statement of cash flows. In addition, cash and cash equivalents increased by 1.5 billion yen. See Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the VIEs that are used by Sony. In December 2003, the FASB issued revised FIN No. 46 (FIN No. 46R), which replaced FIN No. 46. Sony early adopted the provisions of FIN No. 46R upon its issuance. The adoption of FIN No. 46R did not have an impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position or impact the way Sony had previously accounted for VIEs. RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (FAS No. 123(R)). This statement requires the use of the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation and eliminates the alternative use of the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principle Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. With limited exceptions, FAS No. 123(R) requires that the grant-date fair value of share-based payments to employees be expensed over the period the service is received. Sony has accounted for its employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions prescribed by APB No. 25 and its related interpretations and has disclosed the net effect on net income and net income per share allocated to the common stock if Sony had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation as described in Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2(2) Significant accounting policies  Stock-based compensation. This statement shall be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged during the fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued. The options for transition methods prescribed in FAS No. 123(R) include either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective methods. Sony intends to adopt the modified prospective method of transition, which 85 Table of Contents requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock acquisition rights as the requisite service is rendered beginning with the first period of adoption. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new pronouncement. However, Sony expects that the total expenses to be recorded in the future periods will be consistent with the pro forma information in Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2(2) Significant accounting policies  Stock-based compensation. Inventory Costs In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement requires certain abnormal expenditures to be recognized as expenses in the current period. It also requires that the amount of fixed production overhead allocated to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This statement shall be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged during the fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued. The adoption of FAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. This statement requires that exchanges of productive assets be accounted for at fair value unless fair value cannot be reasonably determined or the transaction lacks commercial substance. This statement shall be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with early adoption during the fiscal periods beginning after the date this statement is issued encouraged. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new pronouncement. Item 6.

There is no family relationship between any of the persons named above. There is no arrangement or understanding with major shareholders, customers, suppliers, or others pursuant to which any person named above was selected as a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer. Compensation The aggregate amount of remuneration, including bonuses paid and benefits in kind granted by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 to all Directors and Corporate Executive Officers (refer to Board Practices below) of Sony Corporation who served during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, as a group (28 people), totaled 2,748 million yen. Also, as a part of Sonys incentive compensation arrangements, Sony Corporation issued stock acquisition rights during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. The stock acquisition rights, which represent rights to subscribe for shares of common stock of Sony Corporation, have been granted to the Directors, Corporate Executive Officers, Executive Officers, Group Executive Officers, and selected employees. The stock acquisition rights generally vest ratably up to three years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. The portion of those stock acquisition rights which was granted by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 to the Directors, and Corporate Executive Officers as of May 31, 2005 confers rights to purchase a total number of 712,000 shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock. The exercise price for these stock acquisition rights issued as of November 18, 2004 was 3,782 yen per share, and the exercise price for these stock acquisition rights issued as of March 31, 2005 was 40.34 U.S. dollars. Regarding the above compensation plans, refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate amount accrued for lump-sum severance indemnities by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 for all Directors, and Corporate Executive Officers of Sony Corporation as of May 31, 2005, as a group (26 people), totaled 320 million yen. Board Practices Sony has adopted a corporate governance system called the Company with Committees system under the Japanese Commercial Code (Shoho) and related legislation (including the Law for Special Exceptions to the Commercial Code concerning Audit, etc. of Kabushiki Kaisha, collectively the Commercial Code). Under this system, Sony Corporation has three committees: the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Under the Commercial Code, each committee is required to consist of not less than three Directors, the majority of whom must be outside Directors. Under the committee system, Directors as such have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except for limited circumstances as permitted by law. The Board of Directors must elect Corporate Executive Officers (Shikko- 97 Table of Contents yaku), who are responsible for execution of the business of Sony Corporation. A summary of the new governance system adopted by Sony Corporation is set forth below. The Board of Directors determines the fundamental management policy and other important matters related to management of Sony and oversees the performance of the duties of Directors and Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Commercial Code, all Directors must be elected at the General Meeting of Shareholders from the candidates determined by the Nominating Committee. Under the Commercial Code, the terms of office of Directors expire at the conclusion of the General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last closing of accounts within one year after their assumption of office. Directors may serve any number of consecutive terms; although, under the Regulations of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, outside Directors may not be reelected more than five times without the consent of all Directors. The Nominating Committee, which pursuant to the Regulations of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation consists of five or more Directors, determines the content of proposals to be submitted at the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the appointment and dismissal of Directors. As stated above, under the Commercial Code, a majority of the members of the Nominating Committee must be outside Directors. In order to qualify as an outside Director under the Commercial Code, a Director must be a person who is not engaged in the business of Sony Corporation and has never been a director, a corporate executive officer, a general manager or an employee of Sony Corporation or of any of its subsidiaries and is not a director who is also engaged in the business or a corporate executive officer of such a subsidiary or a general manager or an employee of Sony Corporation or of any subsidiary of Sony Corporation. Under the Regulations of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, two or more members of the Nominating Committee must concurrently be Corporate Executive Officers. The Nominating Committee is composed of the following members as of June 21, 2005: Yotaro Kobayashi, who is the Chairman of the Nominating Committee and an outside Director; Hirobumi Kawano and Carlos Ghosn, who are outside Directors; and Nobuyuki Idei and Kunitake Ando, who are Corporate Executive Officers. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the Nominating Committee held seven meetings. Under the Regulations of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, the Audit Committee must consist of three or more Directors, a majority of whom, as stated above, must be outside Directors. In addition, under the Commercial Code, a member of the Audit Committee may not concurrently be a Corporate Executive Officer, a general manager or any other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or a director who is engaged in the business of any of such subsidiaries. Each member of the Audit Committee has the statutory duty to examine the consolidated and non-consolidated financial statements and business (annual) reports to be submitted by the Board of Directors at the General Meeting of Shareholders. The Audit Committee operates under regulations adopted by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committees primary responsibility is to audit the execution of duties by Directors and Corporate Executive Officers with regard to financial statements, disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls, compliance structure, risk management structure, internal audit structure, whistleblower protections and other matters; to propose appointment/dismissal of, approve the compensation of, oversee and evaluate Sonys independent auditors. Under the Commercial Code, the Audit Committee has a statutory duty to prepare and submit its audit report to the Board of Directors each year. A member of the Audit Committee may note his or her opinion in the audit report if it is different from the opinion of the Audit Committee that is expressed in the audit report. The Audit Committee discusses with Sony Corporations independent auditor, ChuoAoyama PricewaterhouseCoopers, the scope and results of their audits including their evaluation of Sony Corporations internal controls, compatibility with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S., and the overall quality of financial reporting. The Audit Committee ensures the independence of ChuoAoyama PricewaterhouseCoopers by overseeing their activities through regular communications and discussions with ChuoAoyama PricewaterhouseCoopers as well as making pre-approval of audit and non-audit services provided. The Audit Committee is composed of the following members as of June 21, 2005: Yoshiaki Yamauchi, who is the Chairman of the Audit Committee and an outside Director; Sakie T. Fukushima, who is an outside Director; and Akihisa Ohnishi, who is a Director and full-time member of the Audit Committee. Both Yoshiaki Yamauchi and Akihisa Ohnishi are audit committee financial experts within the meaning of Item 16A of this report. The Audit Committee held 15 meetings in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. 98 Table of Contents As required by the Commercial Code, the Compensation Committee determines the compensation (including equity-related rights or options given for the purpose of stock incentive options) to be received by each Director and Corporate Executive Officer. In addition to such statutory duties, the Compensation Committee determines the compensation to be received by each Executive Officer and Group Executive Officer, and also proposes to the Board of Directors stock option plans (involving the issuance of share acquisition rights and other forms of stock price based compensation) to be granted to Directors, officers and employees of Sony. Under the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee shall consist of three or more Directors and one or more members must concurrently serve as Corporate Executive Officers. As stated above, a majority of the members of the Compensation Committee must be outside Directors. The Compensation Committee is composed of the following members as of June 21, 2005: Akishige Okada, who is the Chairman of the Compensation Committee and an outside Director; Yoshihiko Miyauchi, who is an outside Director; and Teruo Masaki, who is a Corporate Executive Officer. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the Compensation Committee held seven meetings. No Directors have service contracts with Sony providing for benefits upon termination of service as a Director. Under the Commercial Code and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may, by a resolution of the Board of Directors, exempt Directors from liabilities to Sony Corporation to the extent permitted by law arising in connection with their failure to perform their duties. In addition, Sony Corporation has entered into a liability limitation agreement with each outside Director which limits the maximum amount of their liabilities owed to Sony Corporation arising in connection with their failure to perform their duties to the greater of either 30 million yen or an amount equal to the aggregate sum of the amounts prescribed in each item of Paragraph 19 of Article 266 of the Commercial Code (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective, the larger of the amount determined by Sony Corporation or the minimum responsibility amount as set forth by the New Company Law). The Board of Directors must appoint one or more Corporate Executive Officers who are authorized to determine matters delegated to them by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Executive Officers are responsible for conducting all the business operations of Sony within the scope of authority delegated by the Board of Directors. As of June 21, 2005, there are 13 Corporate Executive Officers, some of whom are also Directors. Significant decision-making authority has been delegated to the Group CEO and also to each Corporate Executive Officer with regard to investments, strategic alliances and other actions related to the execution of business operations. Sony Corporation believes that this significant delegation enables Sony to be managed in a more dynamic and responsive manner than in the past. The terms of office of Corporate Executive Officers must expire at the conclusion of the first meeting of the Board of Directors held immediately after the conclusion of the General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last closing of accounts within one year after their assumption of office. From among the Corporate Executive Officers who are also Directors, the Board of Directors must elect one or more Representative Corporate Executive Officers. Each Representative Corporate Executive Officer has the statutory authority to represent Sony Corporation in the conduct of its affairs. Employees As of March 31, 2005, Sony had approximately 151,400 employees. Although employees increased at manufacturing facilities in Asia, particularly in China, the total number of employees declined due to the reductions associated with the implementation of restructuring activities in Japan, the U.S., Europe and South-East Asia, and a decrease in the number of employees as a result of Sony combining its recorded music business outside Japan with the recorded music business of Bertelsmann AG forming the jointly-owned company SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT (SONY BMG). The fiscal year-end totals include approximately 2,000 employees in Japan who left Sony mainly through the early retirement program on March 31, 2005 and 3,600 employees in Japan who left Sony mainly through the program on March 31, 2004. As of March 31, 2005, approximately 62,300 employees were located in Japan and approximately 89,100 outside Japan, and approximately 16 percent were members of labor unions. 99 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2004, Sony had approximately 162,000 employees, an increase of approximately 900 from March 31, 2003. As of March 31, 2004, approximately 65,600 employees were located in Japan and approximately 96,400 outside Japan, and approximately 13 percent were members of labor unions. The following table shows the number of employees by segment as of March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. Number of Employees by Segment March 31 2003 2004 2005 Electronics 128,000 127,100 123,600 Game 4,400 4,800 4,300 Music 8,400 6,600 2,100 Pictures 5,700 6,200 5,900 Financial Services 6,600 6,700 6,800 Other 7,300 8,300 6,800 Unallocated  Corporate employees 700 2,300 1,900 Total 161,100 162,000 151,400 In addition, the average number of employees for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, calculated by averaging the total number of employees at the end of each quarter, was 165,300, 165,300 and 154,200 respectively. Sony generally considers its labor relations to be good. Only a few manufacturing facilities have labor unions and, of these, only a few have union contracts. Regarding labor relations in the Electronics segment by area, in Asia, where Sony operates many manufacturing facilities, only a few manufacturing facilities have labor unions that have union contracts. In May 2003, Sony completed negotiations with a labor union regarding the terms of severance for employees who had been working at a manufacturing facility in Indonesia which was closed in the second half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. The outcome of these negotiations did not have a significant impact on Sonys consolidated financial results. In the U.S., no manufacturing facilities have labor unions. In Mexico, one manufacturing facility has a labor union that has a union contract, but labor relations are good and there have been no significant problems in renegotiating the contract. In Europe, Sony maintains good labor relations with the Work Councils in each country, and, while some employees belong to unions, they are not eligible for union contracts. In the Music segment, as a result of the establishment of SONY BMG, 6,000 non-unionized employees of Sony Musics disc manufacturing and distribution operations have now been reclassified to the Electronics segment and 3,600 employees of Sony Music Entertainment Inc. (SMEI)s recorded music business, a certain number of whom were represented by labor unions, are now no longer employees of Sonys consolidated subsidiaries. As the approximately 300 remaining employees of SMEIs music publishing business still classified within the Music segment are non-unionized, there are no labor unions within the Music segment with union contracts. In the Pictures segment, Sony also generally considers its labor relations to be good. A number of Pictures subsidiaries are signatories to union contracts. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, renegotiations for new three-year agreements were successfully concluded with the Directors Guild of America (DGA), Screen Actors Guild (SAG), American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), Writers Guild of America (WGA), International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), Basic Craft Unions (Basic Crafts), and Office and Professional Employees International Union Local #174 (Local #174). On June 10, 2005, renegotiations for a new three and one-half year agreement were concluded with the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). The tentative agreement is subject to ratification by the AFM membership. 100 Table of Contents Sony continuously strives to provide competitive wages and benefits and good working conditions for all of its employees. Share Ownership The following is the total number of shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock beneficially owned by Directors and Corporate Executive Officers as of May 31, 2005 (25 people). Refer to Board Practices above. Number of shares Percentage Title of class Identity of person or group beneficially owned of class (In thousands) Common Stock Directors and Executive Officers 1,161 0.1 Regarding compensation plans, following the amendments to the Commercial Code of Japan effective May 2002, Sony integrated different equity-related securities it had previously issued for the purpose of giving stock incentives into one unified stock option right. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony granted stock acquisition rights, which represent rights to subscribe for shares of common stock of Sony Corporation, to Directors, Corporate Executive Officers, Executive Officers, Group Executive Officers, and selected employees.

Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Sonys investments in and transactions with equity affiliates. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation have performed and continue to perform commercial banking services for Sony.

(SCE) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation through a stock for stock exchange pursuant to Article 358 of the Japanese Commercial Code (Shoho), which does not require approval of such transactions at a General Meeting of Shareholders of Sony Corporation. The stock for stock exchange ratio was determined based on the estimated equity values of SCE and Sony on a consolidated basis. Through the stock for stock exchange, Sony Corporation provided 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to an Executive Deputy President who was also a Corporate Executive Officer of Sony Corporation and who owned 100 shares of SCEs common stock. This transaction did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2005. Interests of Experts and Counsel Not Applicable Item 8. Financial Information Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information Refer to Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal Proceedings Sony Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in several pending legal proceedings. However, based upon the information currently available to Sony, management of Sony believes that damages from such legal proceedings, if any, would not have a material effect on Sonys consolidated financial results and condition. Dividend Policy Sony believes that continuously increasing corporate value and providing dividends are essential to rewarding shareholders. It is Sonys policy to utilize retained earnings, after ensuring the perpetuation of stable dividends, to carry out various investments that contribute to an increase in corporate value such as those that ensure future growth and strengthen competitiveness. A fiscal year-end cash dividend of 12.5 yen per share of Sony Corporation Common Stock was approved at the Board of Directors meeting held on May 16, 2005 and was paid on June 1, 2005. Sony Corporation has 103 Table of Contents already paid an interim dividend for Common Stock of 12.5 yen per share to each shareholder; accordingly, the total annual cash dividend per share of Common Stock is 25.0 yen. Regarding shares of subsidiary tracking stock issued in Japan by Sony Corporation, Sony Communication Network Corporation (SCN) has been working to manage its operations so as to expand cash flow, fully solidify its financial base and increase its retained earnings to aggressively expand its business to strengthen its foundation and respond to the quickly expanding Internet market. For these reasons, SCN does not plan to distribute earnings to SCN shareholders for the time being. As such, Sony Corporation will continue its policy of not paying dividends to shareholders of the subsidiary tracking stock. Significant Changes No significant change has occurred since the date of the annual financial statements included in this annual report.

Additional Information Share Capital Not applicable Memorandum and Articles of Association Organization Sony Corporation is a joint stock corporation (Kabushiki Kaisha)incorporated in Japan under the Commercial Code (Shoho) of Japan. It is registered in the Commercial Register (Shogyo Tokibo) maintained by the Shinagawa Branch Office of the Tokyo Bureau of Legal Affairs. Objects and purposes Article 3 of the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provides that its purpose is to engage in the following business activities: (i) manufacture and sale of electronic and electrical machines and equipment, medical instruments, optical instruments and other equipment, machines and instruments; (ii) planning, production and sale of audio-visual software and computer software programs; (iii) manufacture and sale of metal industrial products, chemical industrial products and ceramic industrial products, textile products, paper products and wood-crafted articles, daily necessities, foodstuffs and toys, transportation machines, equipment, petroleum and coal products; (iv) real estate activities, construction business, transportation business and warehousing business; (v) publishing business and printing business; (vi) advertising agency business, insurance agency business, broadcasting enterprise, recreation business such as travel, management of sporting facilities, etc. and other service enterprises; (vii) financial business; (viii) Type I and Type II telecommunications business under the Telecommunications Business Law; (ix) investing in stocks and bonds, etc.; (x) manufacture, sale, export and import of products which are incidental to or related to those mentioned above; (xi) rendering of services related to those mentioned above; (xii) investment in businesses mentioned above operated by other companies or persons; and (xiii) all businesses which are incidental to or related to those mentioned above. 106 Table of Contents Directors Under the Commercial Code (including the Law for Special Exceptions to the Commercial Code concerning Audit, etc. of Kabushiki-Kaisha, collectively the Commercial Code), Directors have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except in limited circumstances permitted by law. If a Director also serves concurrently as a Corporate Executive Officer, then he or she can execute the business of Sony Corporation in the capacity of Corporate Executive Officer. Under the Commercial Code, Directors must refrain from engaging in any business competing with Sony Corporation unless approved by the Board of Directors, and any Director who has a material interest in the subject matter of a resolution to be taken by the Board of Directors cannot vote on such resolution. The amount of remuneration to each Director is determined by the Compensation Committee, which consists of Directors, the majority of whom are outside Directors (Refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees). No member of the Compensation Committee may vote on a resolution with respect to his or her own compensation as a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer. Except as stated below, neither the Commercial Code nor Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation make a special provision as to the borrowing powers exercisable by Directors, their retirement age, or a requirement to hold any shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. The Commercial Code specifically requires a resolution of the Board of Directors, or a determination of the Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such a determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors, for Sony Corporation to acquire or dispose of material assets; to borrow a substantial amount of money; to employ or discharge from employment important employees, such as general managers; and to establish, change or abolish a material corporate organization such as a branch office. The Regulations of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation and regulations thereunder require a resolution of the Board of Directors for Sony Corporations lending in an amount not less than one hundred billion yen or its equivalent. Capital stock Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the following discussion applies equally to both the shares of Common Stock and the shares of subsidiary tracking stock. (General) Except as otherwise stated, set forth below is information relating to Sony Corporations capital stock, including brief summaries of the relevant provisions of Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation and Share Handling Regulations, as currently in effect, and of the Commercial Code and related legislation. A bill to modernize and make overall amendments to the Commercial Code by replacing the current provisions with regard to corporations with a new company law (the New Company Law) was submitted to the Diet on March 22, 2005. The proposed New Company Law is to be enacted during the first half of 2005 and will come into effect within one year and half after its promulgation, and currently, it is expected that it will take effect in April 2006. The proposed legislation is subject to discussion at, and approval by, the Diet. In order to assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation, a shareholder must, except as set forth below, have its name and address registered on Sony Corporations register of shareholders, in accordance with Sony Corporations Share Handling Regulations. The registered beneficial holder of deposited shares underlying the American Depositary Shares (ADSs) is the Depositary for the ADSs. Accordingly, holders of ADSs will not be able to directly assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation. UFJ Trust Bank Limited is the transfer agent for Sony Corporations capital stock. As such, it keeps Sony Corporations registers of shareholders and beneficial shareholders in its office at 4-3, Marunouchi 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, and records transfers of shares upon presentation of the certificates representing the transferred shares. 107 Table of Contents A holder of shares may choose, at its discretion, to participate in the central clearing system for share certificates under the Law Concerning Central Clearing of Share Certificates and Other Securities of Japan. Participating shareholders must deposit certificates representing all of the shares to be included in this clearing system with Japan Securities Depository Center, Inc., or JASDEC. If a holder is not a participating institution in JASDEC, it must participate through a participating institution, such as a securities company or bank having a clearing account with JASDEC. All shares deposited with JASDEC will be registered in the name of JASDEC on Sony Corporations register of shareholders. Each participating shareholder will in turn be registered on Sony Corporations register of beneficial shareholders and be treated in the same way as shareholders registered on Sony Corporations register of shareholders. Entry of the share transfer in the book maintained by JASDEC for participating institutions, or in the book maintained by a participating institution for its customers, has the same effect as delivery of share certificates. The registered beneficial shareholders may exercise the rights attached to the shares, such as voting rights, and will receive dividends (if any) and notices to shareholders directly from Sony Corporation. The shares held by a person as a registered shareholder and those held by the same person as a registered beneficial shareholder are aggregated for these purposes. Beneficial owners may at any time withdraw their shares from deposit and receive share certificates. A new law to establish a new central clearing system for shares of listed companies and to eliminate the issuance and use of certificates for such shares was promulgated in June 2004 and the relevant part of the law will come into effect within five years of the date of the promulgation. On the effective date, a new central clearing system will be established and the shares of all Japanese companies listed on any Japanese stock exchange, including the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation, will be subject to the new central clearing system. On the same day, all existing share certificates will become null and void and the companies are not required to withdraw those share certificates from shareholders. The transfer of such shares will be effected through entry in the books maintained under the new central clearing system. (Authorized capital) Article 5 of the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provides that Sony Corporation may issue both shares of Common Stock and shares of subsidiary tracking stock. Subsidiary tracking stock is stock which dividend rights track the dividend rights of a particular subsidiary of Sony Corporation. The rights of the holders of such stock may be different from those of the holders of Sony Corporations Common Stock in certain other respects such as rights to receive residual assets in the event of liquidation of Sony Corporation. Paragraph 2 of Article 5 of Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provides that the total number of shares authorized to be issued by Sony Corporation is 3.6 billion shares, of which 3.5 billion shares shall be Common Stock and 100 million shares shall be subsidiary tracking stock. If shares of Common Stock are retired or shares of subsidiary tracking stock are either retired or converted into shares of Common Stock, the respective numbers of shares so retired or converted shall be deducted from the respective total numbers of shares authorized to be issued by Sony Corporation. All shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation have no par value. (Dividends) Dividends  General The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that the accounts shall be closed on March 31 of each year. Year-end cash dividends, if any, shall be paid to shareholders, beneficial shareholders and pledgees of record as of the end of such day. After the close of the fiscal period, a Corporate Executive Officer designated by the Board of Directors prepares, among other things, a proposed allocation of profits for dividends and other purposes; this proposal is submitted to the Audit Committee and to independent certified public accountants and then submitted for approval to the Board of Directors. If each independent certified accountant states in his or her audit report the opinion that the financial statements prepared by such Corporate Executive Officer and proposed allocation of profits are in accordance with relevant laws and the Articles of Incorporation, and if the Audit Committee does not state in its audit report any objection to such independent accountants opinion or an opinion that the proposed allocation of profits is significantly 108 Table of Contents inappropriate, such proposal shall be deemed to be approved by the shareholders when approved by the Board of Directors. Under the New Company Law, subject to certain limitations on the distributable surplus as described below, dividends, if any, may be paid to shareholders, beneficial shareholders, and pledgees of record as of a record date as set forth by the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation or as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time. Dividends shall be paid by way of distribution of surplus. Dividends may be distributed in cash or in kind. In distributing dividends, Sony Corporation may determine the kind of assets to be distributed, the book value of such assets, matters regarding allocation of such assets, and the effective date of such dividends, by a resolution of a general meeting of shareholders. However, Sony Corporation may generally determine such matters by a resolution of the Board of Directors if (a) the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation so provide, (b) the term of its Directors is set to be until the conclusion of the ordinary general meeting of shareholders held with respect to the last closing of accounts within one year after such Directors assumption of office, and (c) certain requirements regarding the financial statements and certain documents of Sony Corporation as set forth in an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice are met; provided, however, that when Sony Corporation is to pay dividends in-kind without giving shareholders the right to request payment of cash dividends in lieu of in-kind dividends, it shall determine such matters by a special shareholders resolution (as defined in (Voting Rights)). When Sony Corporation makes payment of dividends, it shall allocate such dividends in proportion to the number of shares of any specific class held by each shareholder. Dividends  Interim cash dividends In addition to fiscal year-end cash dividends, the Board of Directors may by its resolution declare a cash distribution pursuant to Article 293-5 of the Commercial Code (an interim dividend) payable to shareholders, beneficial shareholders and pledgees of record at the end of each September 30, without shareholders approval, but subject to the limitation described below. Under the New Company Law, Sony Corporation is allowed to make payment of interim dividends during a fiscal year by way of distribution of surplus by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that such payment of interim dividends shall be limited to cash dividends and also limited to once per any fiscal year. Dividends  Legal reserve The Commercial Code provides that a company may not make any distribution of profit by way of dividends or interim dividends unless it has set aside in its legal reserve an amount equal to at least one-tenth of the amount paid by way of appropriation of retained earnings for such fiscal period, or equal to one-tenth of the amount of interim dividends, until the aggregate amount of its additional paid-in capital and its legal reserve is at least one-quarter of its stated capital. The New Company Law provides that when a stock company like Sony Corporation makes distribution of surplus, it shall set aside in its legal reserve an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of the surplus to be decreased as a result of such distribution of surplus in accordance with the provisions set forth in an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice. Dividends  Distributable amount Under the Commercial Code, Sony Corporation is permitted to distribute profits by way of fiscal year-end or interim dividends out of the excess of its net assets, on a non-consolidated basis, over the aggregate of: (i) its stated capital; (ii) its additional paid-in capital; (iii) its accumulated legal reserve; (iv) the legal reserve to be set aside in respect of the fiscal period concerned; and (v) such other amounts as are provided for by an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice. 109 Table of Contents In the case of interim dividends, the net assets are calculated by reference to the non-consolidated balance sheet as at the last date of the preceding fiscal year, but adjusted to reflect (a) the legal reserve to be set aside in respect of interim dividends, (b) any subsequent payment by way of appropriation of retained earnings and transfer to legal reserve in respect thereof, (c) any subsequent transfer of retained earnings to stated capital and (d) if Sony Corporation has been authorized, pursuant to a resolution of an ordinary general meeting of shareholders, a resolution of the Board of Directors or both, to purchase shares of its Common Stock or shares of its subsidiary tracking stock (Refer to (Acquisition by Sony Corporation of its capital stock) and Subsidiary tracking stock  (Acquisition by Sony Corporation of its subsidiary tracking stock) below), the total amount of the purchase price of such shares so authorized by such resolution that may be paid by Sony Corporation and (e) such other amounts as are set out in an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice of Japan, provided that the amount distributable as interim dividends, as described above, will be increased by (x) any amount reduced by Sony Corporation if Sony Corporation reduces the amount of its stated capital, additional paid-in capital or accumulated legal reserve after the end of the preceding fiscal year, less the amount paid to shareholders upon such reduction and certain other amounts, and (y) such other amounts as are set out in an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice of Japan. Under the New Company Law, Sony Corporation is permitted to make distribution of surplus to the extent that the aggregate book value of the assets to be distributed to shareholders does not exceed the Distributable Amount (as defined below) as at the effective date of such distribution of surplus. The amount of surplus at any given time shall be the amount of Sony Corporations assets and the book value of Sony Corporations treasury stock after subtracting the amounts of the following items (1) through (4) as they appear on Sony Corporations non-consolidated balance sheet as at the end of Sony Corporations last fiscal year, and after reflecting the changes in Sony Corporations surplus after the end of Sony Corporations last fiscal year, by adding the amounts of the following items (5), (6) and (7) and/or subtracting the amounts of the following items (8), (9) and (10): (1) its liabilities; (2) its stated capital; (3) its additional paid-in capital and accumulated legal reserve; (4) other amounts as provided for by an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice; (5) (if Sony Corporation transferred its treasury stock after the end of the last fiscal year) the transfer price of its treasury stock after subtracting the book value thereof; (6) (if Sony Corporation decreased its stated capital after the end of the last fiscal year) the amount of decrease in its stated capital (excluding the amount transferred to the additional paid-in capital or legal reserve); (7) (if Sony Corporation decreased its additional paid-in capital or legal reserve after the end of the last fiscal year) the amount of decrease in its additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (excluding the amount transferred to the stated capital); (8) (if Sony Corporation cancelled its treasury stock after the end of the last fiscal year) the book value of its treasury stock so cancelled; (9) (if Sony Corporation distributed surplus to shareholders after the end of the last fiscal year) the assets distributed to shareholders by way of such distribution of surplus; and (10) other amounts as provided for by an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice. The Distributable Amount of Sony Corporation at any given time shall be the aggregate amount of (a) the surplus, (b) the amount of profit as recorded for the period after the end of Sony Corporations last fiscal year until the date of an extraordinary settlement of account (if any) as provided for in an ordinance of 110 Table of Contents the Ministry of Justice and (c) the transfer price of its treasury stock in the same period, after subtracting the amounts of the following items: (1) the book value of its treasury stock; (2) (if Sony Corporation transferred its treasury stock after the end of the last fiscal year) the transfer price of its treasury stock; (3) the losses as recorded for the period after the end of Sony Corporations last fiscal year until the date of an extraordinary settlement of account (if any) as provided for in an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice; and (4) other amounts as provided for by an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice. Dividends  Ex-dividend date and prescription In Japan the ex-dividend date and the record date for dividends precede the date of determination of the amount of the dividend to be paid. Under its Articles of Incorporation, Sony Corporation is not obliged to pay any dividends that are left unclaimed for a period of five years after the date on which they first became payable. Dividends  Liabilities Under the Commercial Code, if Sony Corporation were to pay interim dividends for a fiscal year and at the end of a fiscal year in which there had been no excess of net assets over the aggregate of the amounts referred to in (i) through (v) in Dividends  Distributable amount above, the Directors who authorized such interim dividends would be jointly and severally liable to Sony Corporation for the lesser of the amount of such deficit or the amount of such dividends, unless such Directors prove that they did not fail to exercise due care in determining such interim dividends. Under the New Company Law, where dividends are paid out of the surplus, if the aggregate amount of the following items (1), (2) and (3) as at the end of the relevant fiscal year exceeds the amount of surplus, Directors who have authorized such dividends, would be liable to Sony Corporation for the lesser of such amount in excess or the amount of money or book value of such distributed surplus unless such Directors prove that they did not fail to exercise due care in determining such distribution: (1) the book value of Sony Corporations treasury stock; (2) (if Sony Corporation transferred its treasury stock after the end of the last fiscal year) the transfer price of its treasury stock after the end of Sony Corporations last fiscal year; (3) other amounts as provided for by an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice. However, the Directors shall not be liable to Sony Corporation for the distributions of surplus made pursuant to the resolution of the ordinary general meeting of shareholders. (Stock Splits) Sony Corporation may at any time split shares in issue into a greater number of shares at the determination of the Group CEO. In the event of a stock split, generally, shareholders will not be required to exchange share certificates for new share certificates, but certificates representing the additional shares resulting from the stock split will be issued to shareholders. When a stock split is to be made Sony Corporation must give public notice of the stock split, specifying the record date thereof, at least two weeks prior to such record date. In addition, promptly after the stock split takes effect Sony Corporation must give notice to each shareholder specifying the number of shares to which such shareholder is entitled by virtue of the stock split. After the New Company Law becomes effective, no such notice to each shareholder is required. 111 Table of Contents (Consolidation of Shares) Sony Corporation may at any time consolidate issued shares into a smaller number of shares by a special shareholders resolution (as defined in (Voting Rights)). When a consolidation of shares is to be made, Sony Corporation must give public notice and notice to each shareholder that, within a period of not less than one month specified in the notice, share certificates must be submitted to Sony Corporation for exchange. Sony Corporation must disclose the reason for the consolidation of shares at the general meeting of shareholders. (General Meeting of Shareholders) The ordinary general meeting of shareholders of Sony Corporation for each fiscal year is normally held in June of each year in Tokyo, Japan. In addition, Sony Corporation may hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders whenever necessary by giving notice thereof at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Notice of a shareholders meeting setting forth the place, time and purpose thereof, must be mailed to each shareholder having voting rights (or, in the case of a non-resident shareholder, to such shareholders resident proxy or mailing address in Japan) at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Under the Commercial Code, such notice may be given to shareholders by electronic means, subject to obtaining consent by the relevant shareholders. The record date for an ordinary general meeting of shareholders is March 31 of each year. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least three percent (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective and in the event that Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporations provide for a percentage lower than three percent, such percentage) of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective and in the event that Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporations provide for a period shorter than six months, such period) or more may require the convocation of a general meeting of shareholders for a particular purpose. Unless such a shareholders meeting is convened promptly or a convocation notice of a meeting which is to be held not later than eight weeks (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective and in the event that Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporations provide for a period shorter than eight weeks, such period) from the day of such demand is dispatched, the requiring shareholder may, upon obtaining a court approval, convene such a shareholders meeting. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least 300 (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective and in the event that Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporations provide for a number less than 300, such number) voting rights or one percent (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective and in the event that Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporations provide for a percentage lower than one percent, such percentage) of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective and in the event that Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporations provide for a period shorter than six months, such period) or more may propose a matter to be considered at a general meeting of shareholders by submitting a written request to Sony Corporation at least eight weeks (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective and in the event that Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporations provide for a period shorter than eight weeks, such period) prior to the date set for such meeting. (Voting rights) So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, a holder of shares (whether shares of Common Stock or shares of subsidiary tracking stock) constituting one or more units is entitled to one vote for each such unit of stock (Refer to (Unit share system) below, currently 100 shares constitute one unit), except that no voting rights with respect to shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation are afforded to Sony Corporation or any corporate shareholder more than one-quarter of the total voting rights of which are directly or indirectly held by Sony Corporation (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective, management of which is being controlled in substance by Sony Corporation as provided for by an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice). If Sony Corporation eliminates from its Articles of Incorporation the provisions relating to units of stock, holders of capital stock will have one vote for each share they hold. Except as otherwise provided by law 112 Table of Contents or by the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, a resolution can be adopted at a general meeting of shareholders by a majority of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting. The Commercial Code (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective, the New Company Law) and Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide, however, that the quorum for the election of Directors shall not be less than one-third of the total number of voting rights of all the shareholders. Sony Corporations shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of Directors. Shareholders may cast their votes in writing and may also exercise their voting rights through proxies, provided that the proxies are also shareholders holding voting rights. Shareholders may also exercise their voting rights by electronic means pursuant to the method designated by Sony Corporation. The Commercial Code (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective, the New Company Law) and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that in order to amend the Articles of Incorporation and in certain other instances, including: (1) acquisition of its own shares from a specific party; (2) consolidation of shares; (3) any offering of new shares at a specially favorable price (or any offering of stock acquisition rights to subscribe for or acquire shares of capital stock, or bonds with stock acquisition rights at specially favorable conditions) to any persons other than shareholders; (4) the removal of a Director (when the New Company Law becomes effective, the removal of a Director who is elected by cumulative voting); (5) the exemption of liability of a Director or Corporate Executive Officer with certain exceptions; (6) a reduction of stated capital (when the New Company Law becomes effective, with certain exceptions in which a shareholders resolution is not required); (7) (when the New Company Law becomes effective) a distribution of in-kind dividends which meets certain requirements; (8) dissolution, merger, or consolidation with certain exceptions in which a shareholders resolution is not required; (9) the transfer of the whole or a material part of the business; (10) the taking over of the whole of the business of any other corporation with certain exceptions in which a shareholders resolution is not required; (11) share exchange or share transfer for the purpose of establishing 100 percent parent-subsidiary relationships with certain exceptions in which a shareholders resolution is not required; or (12) separating of the corporation into two or more corporations with certain exceptions in which a shareholders resolution is not required, the quorum shall be one-third of the total number of voting rights of all the shareholders, and the approval by at least two-thirds (or, when the New Company Law becomes effective and in the event that Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporations provide for a percentage more than two-thirds, such percentage) of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting is required (in addition, when the New Company Law becomes effective and in the event that Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide that the approval by certain number of shareholders is required, such approval is also required) (the special shareholders resolutions). (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) Holders of Sony Corporations shares of capital stock have no pre-emptive rights under its Articles of Incorporation. Authorized but unissued shares (whether of Common Stock or of subsidiary tracking stock) may be issued at such times and upon such terms as the Board of Directors or the Group CEO determines, 113 Table of Contents subject to the limitations as to the offering of new shares at a specially favorable price mentioned under (Voting rights) above. The Board of Directors or the Group CEO may, however, determine that shareholders of a particular class of stock shall be given subscription rights regarding a particular issue of new shares of that class, in which case such rights must be given on uniform terms to all shareholders of that class of stock as at a record date of which not less than two weeks prior public notice must be given. Each of the shareholders to whom such rights are given must also be given notice of the expiry thereof at least two weeks prior to the date on which such rights expire. Subject to certain conditions, Sony Corporation may issue stock acquisition rights by a resolution of the Board of Directors or a determination by the Group CEO. Holders of stock acquisition rights may exercise their rights to acquire a certain number of shares within the exercise period as prescribed in the terms of their stock acquisition rights. Upon exercise of stock acquisition rights, Sony Corporation will be obliged to issue the relevant number of new shares or alternatively to transfer the necessary number of treasury stock held by it. In cases where a particular issue of new shares or stock acquisition rights (i) violates laws and regulations or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation, or (ii) will be performed in a manner materially unfair, and shareholders may suffer disadvantages therefrom, such shareholder may file an injunction to enjoin such issue with a court. (Liquidation rights) In the event of a liquidation of Sony Corporation, the assets remaining after payment of all debts, liquidation expenses and taxes will, subject to the rights of the holders of subsidiary tracking stock discussed under Subsidiary tracking stock  (Distribution of residual assets) below, be distributed among the holders of shares of Common Stock in proportion to the respective numbers of shares of Common Stock held. (Record date) March 31 is the record date for Sony Corporations year-end dividends, if declared. So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, the shareholders and beneficial shareholders who are registered as the holders of one or more unit of stock in Sony Corporations register of shareholders and/or beneficial shareholders at the end of each March 31 are also entitled to exercise shareholders rights at the ordinary general meeting of shareholders with respect to the fiscal year ending on such March 31. September 30 is the record date for interim dividends. In addition, Sony Corporation may set a record date for determining the shareholders and/or beneficial shareholders entitled to other rights and for other purposes by giving at least two weeks prior public notice. The price of shares generally goes ex-dividend or ex-rights on Japanese stock exchanges on the third business day prior to a record date (or if the record date is not a business day, the fourth business day prior thereto), for the purpose of dividends or rights offerings. (Acquisition by Sony Corporation of its capital stock) Sony Corporation may acquire its own shares through a stock exchange on which such shares are listed (pursuant to an ordinary resolution of an ordinary general meeting of shareholders or a resolution of the Board of Directors), by way of tender offer (pursuant to an ordinary resolution of an ordinary general meeting of shareholders or a resolution of the Board of Directors), by purchase from a specific party other than a subsidiary of Sony Corporation (pursuant to a special resolution of an ordinary general meeting of shareholders) or from a subsidiary of Sony Corporation (pursuant to a determination by the Group CEO). Under the New Company Law, not only ordinary general meetings of shareholders but also extraordinary general meetings of shareholders will be able to approve the acquisition by Sony Corporation of its own shares in the cases of (a) and (b) above. When such acquisition is made by Sony Corporation from a specific party other than a subsidiary of Sony Corporation, any other shareholder may make a request to the Company in writing, not later than five days prior to the relevant shareholders meeting, to include him/her as a seller in the proposed purchase. However, under the New Company Law, the acquisition of its own shares at a price 114 Table of Contents not exceeding the then market price to be provided under an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice will not trigger the right of any shareholder to be included as a seller of his/her shares in such proposed purchase. Any such acquisition of shares must satisfy certain requirements, including the requirement that in cases other than the acquisition by Sony Corporation of its own shares pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, the total amount of the purchase price may not exceed the sum of the amount of retained earnings available for year-end dividend payments after taking into account any reduction, if any, of the stated capital, additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (if such reduction of the stated capital, additional paid-in capital or legal reserve has been authorized pursuant to a resolution of the relevant ordinary general meeting of shareholders), minus the sum of the amount to be paid by way of appropriation of retained earnings for the relevant fiscal year and the amount to be transferred to stated capital in respect of the relevant fiscal year pursuant to a resolution of such general meeting of shareholders. If Sony Corporation purchases shares pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, the total amount of the purchase price may not exceed the amount of the retained earnings available for an interim dividend payment minus the amount of any interim dividend Sony Corporation actually paid. However, if it is anticipated that the net assets on the non-consolidated balance sheet as at the end of the relevant fiscal year will be less than the aggregate amount of the stated capital, additional paid-in capital and other items as described in (i) through (v) to Dividends  Distributable amount above, Sony Corporation may not acquire such shares. Under the New Company Law, the restriction on the source of funds for the acquisition by Sony Corporation of its own shares will be integrated into those for the distribution of surplus to the shareholders. See (Dividends). Shares acquired by Sony Corporation may be held for any period or may be retired at the determination of the Group CEO. Sony Corporation may also transfer (by public or private sale or otherwise) to any person the shares held by it, subject to a determination by the Group CEO, and subject also to other requirements similar to those applicable to the issuance of new shares, as described in (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) above. Sony Corporation may also utilize its treasury stock for the purpose of transfer to any person upon exercise of stock acquisition rights or for the purpose of acquiring another company by way of merger, share exchange or corporate split through exchange of treasury stock for shares or assets of the acquired company. (Unit share system) The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that 100 shares constitute one unit of shares of stock. The Board of Directors or the Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such a determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors is permitted to amend the Articles of Incorporation to reduce the number of shares that constitute a unit or to abolish the unit share system entirely. The number of shares constituting one unit cannot exceed 1,000 shares or one-two hundredth (1/200) of the aggregate number of all issued shares. Under the unit share system, shareholders have one voting right for each unit of stock that they hold. Any number of shares less than one full unit have no voting rights nor rights related to voting rights. The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that no share certificates may be issued with respect to any number of shares constituting less than one full unit, unless Sony Corporation deems the issue of such share certificates to be necessary for any shareholder(s). As the transfer of shares normally requires delivery of the certificates therefor, fractions of a unit for which no share certificate has been issued are not transferable. Except as otherwise described above, holders of the shares constituting less than one full unit will have all the rights granted to shareholders under the Commercial Code. A holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may require Sony Corporation to purchase such Shares at their market value in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that a holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may request Sony Corporation to sell to such holder such amount of shares which will, when added together with the shares constituting less than one full unit, constitute one full unit of stock. Such 115 Table of Contents request by a holder and the sale by Sony Corporation must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. A holder who owns ADRs evidencing less than 100 ADSs will indirectly own less than one full unit. Although, as discussed above, under the unit share system holders of less than one full unit have the right to require Sony Corporation to purchase their shares or sell shares held by Sony Corporation to such holders, holders of ADRs evidencing ADSs that represent other than integral multiples of whole units are unable to withdraw the underlying shares of capital stock representing less than one full unit and, therefore, are unable, as a practical matter, to exercise the rights to require Sony Corporation to purchase such underlying shares or sell shares held by Sony Corporation to such holders. As a result, access to the Japanese markets by holders of ADRs through the withdrawal mechanism will not be available for dispositions of shares in lots less than one full unit. The unit share system does not affect the transferability of ADSs, which may be transferred in lots of any size. (Sale by Sony Corporation of shares held by shareholders whose location is unknown) Sony Corporation is not required to send a notice to a shareholder if a notice to such shareholder fails to arrive at the registered address of the shareholder in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation continuously for five years or more. In addition, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of shares of capital stock for which the location of the shareholder is unknown. Generally, if (i) notices to a shareholder fail to arrive continuously for five years or more at the shareholders registered address in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, and (ii) the shareholder fails to receive dividends on the shares continuously for five years or more at the address registered in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholders shares at the then market price of the shares by a determination of a Corporate Executive Officer and after giving at least three months prior public and individual notice, and hold or deposit the proceeds of such sale or disposal of shares for such shareholder. Subsidiary tracking stock By a special resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on January 25, 2001, Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation were amended to enable Sony Corporation to issue shares of subsidiary tracking stock. By resolutions of the Board of Directors dated May 15 and 31, 2001, Sony Corporation created and issued 3,072,000 shares of a series of subsidiary tracking stock. The subsidiary whose economic value this series of subsidiary tracking stock tracks is Sony Communication Network Corporation (SCN), a Japanese corporation directly and indirectly wholly-owned by Sony Corporation. Except as otherwise stated in the preceding paragraphs and as stated in the following paragraphs, the shares of the subsidiary tracking stock have the same rights and characteristics as those of shares of Common Stock described above. (Dividends) The dividend (the year-end dividend and the interim dividend) on the shares of this series of subsidiary tracking stock is payable only when the board of directors of SCN has resolved to pay to the holders of its common stock a dividend (in the case of year-end dividend, SCNs year-end dividend, and in the case of interim dividend, SCNs interim dividend) in an amount per share of the subsidiary tracking stock equal to the smaller of the amount of SCNs dividend per share of its common stock multiplied by the Standard Ratio (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation: currently one one-hundredth, which is subject to adjustment in the occurrence of certain dilutive events) or 100,000 yen multiplied by the Standard Ratio per share (the Maximum Dividend Amount), subject to statutory restriction on Sony Corporations ability to pay dividends on its shares of capital stock referred to under Capital stock  (Dividends) above. If the amount of interim dividend paid to the holders of shares of a series of subsidiary tracking stock for any fiscal year is less than the amount calculated in accordance with the foregoing formula, such shortfall will be added to the 116 Table of Contents amount of the year-end dividend of such fiscal year. If the amount of dividends paid to the holders of shares of a series of subsidiary tracking stock is less than the amount which should have been paid pursuant to the formula set forth above due to the statutory restriction referred to above or for any other reason, such shortfall will be accumulated and such cumulative amount will be paid to the holders of shares of the subsidiary tracking stock for subsequent fiscal period(s), subject to the statutory limitation set forth above and the Maximum Dividend Amount. Any such dividend on the subsidiary tracking stock is payable in priority to the payment of dividends to the holders of shares of Common Stock. However, the holders of shares of subsidiary tracking stock have no right to participate in the dividends to holders of shares of Common Stock. Furthermore, even if the Board of Directors of SCN does not take a resolution for the payment of dividends to the holders of SCN common stock, Sony Corporation may decide to pay dividends to the holders of its Common Stock. (Voting rights) The holders of shares of subsidiary tracking stock have the same voting rights, subject to the same limitation on voting rights, as those of the holders of shares of Common Stock and, thus, are entitled to participate and vote at any general meeting of shareholders in the same way as the shareholders of Common Stock. In addition, as each series of subsidiary tracking stock is a separate class of stock different from the Common Stock, if any resolution of the general meeting of shareholders for amending the Articles of Incorporation, any granting to shareholders of any series of subsidiary tracking stock certain rights with respect to certain matters including the issue of new shares, stock acquisition rights, bonds with stock acquisition rights, consolidation, split, purchase or retirement of shares, share exchange or share transfer, or a merger or consolidation or splitting of Sony Corporation would adversely affect the rights of the holders of shares of a particular class or classes of subsidiary tracking stock, the holders of shares of each such class of subsidiary tracking stock will have the right to approve or disapprove such resolution by a special resolution of the meeting of holders of shares of that class of subsidiary tracking stock. (Distribution of residual assets) In the event of distribution of residual assets to the shareholders of Sony Corporation, as long as such assets include shares of common stock of SCN, the number of shares of SCN common stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the subsidiary tracking stock held by each holder by the Standard Ratio (if the total number of shares of SCN common stock available for distribution is less than the total number so to be distributed, the lesser number adjusted in proportion to the respective numbers of shares of the subsidiary tracking stock held by such holders) or the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of SCN common stock so to be distributed will be distributed to the holders of shares of the subsidiary tracking stock. Such distribution will be made in priority to the distribution of residual assets to the holders of shares of Common Stock. No other distribution of residual assets will be made to the holders of shares of subsidiary tracking stock. (Acquisition of shares of tracking stock) The shares of subsidiary tracking stock may be subject to acquisition in the same manner and under the same restriction as the shares of Common Stock referred to under Capital stock  (Acquisition by Sony Corporation of its capital stock) above. In addition, Sony Corporation may at any time retire the entire amount of all outstanding shares of that series of subsidiary tracking stock upon paying to the holders thereof an amount equal to the current market price (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation) of shares of the subsidiary tracking stock out of Sony Corporations retained earnings available for dividend payments. Sony Corporation may also retire the shares of a series of subsidiary tracking stock in their entirety pursuant to the procedures prescribed by the Commercial Code for the reduction of capital upon payment to the holders of shares of the subsidiary tracking stock an amount equal to the market value thereof as set forth above. 117 Table of Contents (Conversion of subsidiary tracking stock) So long as the shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock are listed or registered on any stock exchange or over-the-counter market (a Stock Exchange), Sony Corporation may at any time convert the entire amount of all outstanding shares of the subsidiary tracking stock into shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock at the rate of the multiple of 1.1 of the market value (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation) of shares of the subsidiary tracking stock divided by the market value (as similarly defined) of shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock. (Compulsory termination) If any of the following events occurs, the entire amount of all outstanding shares of the subsidiary tracking stock will be either retired or converted into shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock at the price or rate set forth above: (i) SCN transfers its assets representing 80 percent or more of the total assets appearing on its most recent consolidated balance sheet or transfers its business as a result of which its consolidated revenue is expected to decrease by 80 percent or more from its most recent consolidated profit and loss statement; (ii) SCN ceases to be a subsidiary of Sony Corporation; (iii) the number of shares of capital stock of SCN which Sony Corporation directly holds becomes less than the total number of outstanding shares of tracking stock multiplied by the Standard Ratio and such situation continues for a period of 3 months or more; (iv) a resolution was taken by SCNs shareholders for its dissolution; (v) certain events of bankruptcy; or (vi) occurrence of any event which causes de-listing or de-registration of the subsidiary tracking stock from all Stock Exchanges where the tracking stock is listed or registered. If the shares of capital stock of SCN are approved by any Stock Exchange for listing or registration thereon, the entire amount of all outstanding shares of the subsidiary tracking stock will be either retired or converted into shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock at the price or rate set forth above on the date determined by Sony Corporations Board of Directors or the Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such a determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors prior to the date of such approval of the Stock Exchange; or, they may be retired in their entirety by distributing the number of shares of SCN common stock to each holder of shares of the subsidiary tracking stock at the rate calculated by multiplying the number of such shares by the Standard Ratio on the date of such listing or registration or the date prior to such date determined by Sony Corporations Board of Directors or the Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such a determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors. (Miscellaneous) Either or both of the shares of Common Stock and the shares of subsidiary tracking stock may be consolidated or split at the same ratio or at different ratios. The holders of shares of Common Stock and/or the holders of shares of subsidiary tracking stock may be allotted rights to subscribe for new shares (to the holders of Common Stock, new shares of Common Stock, and to the holders of subsidiary tracking stock, new shares of subsidiary tracking stock) at the same ratio or different ratios and on different conditions. At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on April 26, 2005, Sony decided to consider the possibility of an initial public offering of common stock of SCN. In response to recent changes in the Internet-related industry, Sony believes that it will be desirable for Sony and the Sony Group, as well as for SCN, to seek the enhancement of SCNs enterprise value through SCNs own business operations and to employ a strategy 118 Table of Contents more directed at making SCN more independent from Sony and allowing SCN to raise funds with enhanced flexibility on the capital markets. In accordance with the above revised policy, SCN will start making preparations required for or in connection with the listing of its common stock on a stock exchange. If the listing of SCN common stock is approved by the stock exchange, subject to required procedures, Sony will be required under its articles of incorporation to terminate all the shares of the subsidiary tracking stock. Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation stipulate that the method of such termination may be any one of the following: (1) compulsory retirement in cash, (2) compulsory conversion to common stock of Sony Corporation, or (3) compulsory exchange with SCN common stock. With respect to the method of exchange with SCN common stock referred to (3) above, Sonys initial policy was that such method would not be taken unless and until a tax deferment on the difference between the acquisition cost of the subsidiary tracking stock and the market value of SCN common stock is permitted under tax law. No tax law revision that allows such deferral has yet been enacted. Regardless of whether such a revision will ever be enacted, Sony has changed its policy and now permits such a method (compulsory exchange with SCN common stock) of terminating shares of the subsidiary tracking stock. Reporting of substantial shareholdings The Securities and Exchange Law of Japan and its related regulations require any person, regardless of residence, who has become, beneficially and solely or jointly, a holder of more than five percent of the total issued shares of capital stock of a company listed on any Japanese stock exchange or whose shares are traded on the over-the-counter market in Japan to file with the Director General of the competent Regional Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance within five business days a report concerning such shareholdings. A similar report must also be filed in respect of any subsequent change of one percent or more in any such holding, with certain exceptions. For this purpose, shares issuable to such persons upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of share subscription warrants or stock acquisition rights are taken into account in determining both the number of shares held by such holders and the issuers total issued share capital. Copies of such report must also be furnished to the issuer of such shares and all Japanese stock exchanges on which the shares are listed or (in the case of shares traded over-the-counter) the Japan Securities Dealers Association. Except for the general limitation under Japanese anti-trust and anti-monopoly regulations against holding of shares of capital stock of a Japanese corporation which leads or may lead to a restraint of trade or monopoly, and except for general limitations under the Commercial Code or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation on the rights of shareholders applicable regardless of residence or nationality, there is no limitation under Japanese laws and regulations applicable to Sony Corporation or under its Articles of Incorporation on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. There is no provision in Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation or by-laws that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Sony Corporation and that would operate only with respect to merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving Sony Corporation. Material Contracts None Exchange Controls The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Law of Japan and its related cabinet orders and ministerial ordinances (the Foreign Exchange Regulations) govern the acquisition and holding of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation by exchange non-residents and by foreign investors. The Foreign Exchange Regulations currently in effect do not, however, affect transactions between exchange non-residents to purchase or sell shares outside Japan using currencies other than Japanese yen. 119 Table of Contents Exchange non-residents are:  individuals who do not reside in Japan; and  corporations whose principal offices are located outside Japan. Generally, branches and other offices of non-resident corporations that are located within Japan are regarded as residents of Japan. Conversely, branches and other offices of Japanese corporations located outside Japan are regarded as exchange non-residents. Foreign investors are:  individuals who are exchange non-residents;  corporations that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or whose principal offices are located outside of Japan; and  corporations (1) of which 50 percent or more of their shares are held by individuals who are exchange non-residents and/or corporations (a) that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or (b) whose principal offices are located outside of Japan or (2) a majority of whose officers, or officers having the power of representation, are individuals who are exchange non-residents. In general, the acquisition of shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) by an exchange non-resident from a resident of Japan is not subject to any prior filing requirements. In certain limited circumstances, however, the Minister of Finance may require prior approval of an acquisition of this type. While prior approval, as described above, is not required, in the case where a resident of Japan transfers shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) for consideration exceeding 100 million yen to an exchange non-resident, the resident of Japan who transfers the shares is required to report the transfer to the Minister of Finance within 20 days from the date of the transfer, unless the transfer was made through a bank, securities company or financial futures trader licensed under Japanese law. If a foreign investor acquires shares of a Japanese company that is listed on a Japanese stock exchange (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) or that is traded on an over-the-counter market in Japan and, as a result of the acquisition, the foreign investor, in combination with any existing holdings, directly or indirectly holds 10 percent or more of the issued shares of the relevant company, the foreign investor must file a report of the acquisition with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers having jurisdiction over that Japanese company within 15 days from and including the date of the acquisition, except where the offering of the companys shares was made overseas. In limited circumstances, such as where the foreign investor is in a country that is not listed on an exemption schedule in the Foreign Exchange Regulations, a prior notification of the acquisition must be filed with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers, who may then modify or prohibit the proposed acquisition. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, dividends paid on and the proceeds from sales in Japan of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation held by non-residents of Japan may generally be converted into any foreign currency and repatriated abroad. Taxation The following is a summary of the major Japanese national tax and U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership, acquisition and disposition of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation and of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation by a non-resident of Japan or a non-Japanese corporation without a permanent establishment in Japan. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to any particular investor depending on its individual circumstances. Accordingly, holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the considerations discussed below to their particular circumstances. 120 Table of Contents This summary is based upon the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement in relation to the ADSs dated as of June 1, 1961, as amended and restated as of October 31, 1991, as further amended and restated as of March 17, 1995, and in any related agreement, will be performed under its terms. For purposes of the income tax convention between Japan and the United States (the Treaty) and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), U.S. holders of ADSs generally will be treated as owning shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation underlying the ADSs evidenced by the ADRs. For the purposes of the following discussion, a U.S. holder is a holder that: (i) is a resident of the U.S. for purposes of the Treaty; (ii) does not maintain a permanent establishment in Japan (a) with which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are effectively connected or (b) of which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation form part of the business property; and (iii) is eligible for benefits under the Treaty with respect to income and gain derived in connection with shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation. Japanese Taxation The following is a summary of the principal Japanese tax consequences (limited to national taxes) to holders of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation and of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation who are non-residents of Japan or non-Japanese corporations, without a permanent establishment in Japan (non-resident Holders). Generally, a non-resident of Japan or a non-Japanese corporation is subject to Japanese withholding tax on dividends paid by Japanese corporations. Sony Corporation withholds taxes from dividends it pays as required by Japanese law. Stock splits in themselves are not subject to Japanese income tax. In the absence of an applicable tax treaty, convention or agreement reducing the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax or allowing exemption from Japanese withholding tax, the rate of Japanese withholding tax applicable to dividends paid by Japanese corporations to non-residents of Japan or non-Japanese corporations is 20 percent. With respect to dividends paid on listed shares issued by a Japanese corporation (such as the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation) to any corporate or individual shareholders (including those shareholders who are non-Japanese corporations or non-residents of Japan, such as non-resident Holders), except for any individual shareholder who holds 5 percent or more of the total shares issued by the relevant Japanese corporation, the aforementioned 20 percent withholding tax rate is reduced to (i) 7 percent for dividends due and payable on or before March 31, 2008, and (ii) 15 percent for dividends due and payable on or after April 1, 2008. As of the date of this document, Japan has income tax treaties, conventions or agreements whereby the above-mentioned withholding tax rate is reduced, in most cases to 15 percent for portfolio investors with, among other countries, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K. Under the Treaty, the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax which may be imposed on dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that does not own directly or indirectly at least 10 percent of the voting stock of the Japanese corporation is generally limited to 10 percent of the gross amount actually distributed, and Japanese withholding tax with respect to dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that is a pension fund is exempt from Japanese taxation by way of withholding or otherwise unless such dividends are derived from the carrying on of a business, directly or indirectly, by such pension fund. If the maximum tax rate provided for in the income tax treaty applicable to dividends paid by Sony Corporation to any particular non-resident Holder is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law or any particular non-resident Holder is exempt from Japanese income tax with respect to such dividends under the income tax treaty applicable to such particular non-resident Holder, such non-resident Holder is required to submit an Application Form for Income Tax Convention Regarding Relief 121 Table of Contents from Japanese Income Tax on Dividends in advance through Sony Corporation to the relevant tax authority before the payment of dividends. A standing proxy for non-resident Holders of a Japanese corporation may provide this application service. With respect to ADSs, this reduced rate or exemption is applicable if the Depositary or its agent submits two Application Forms (one before payment of dividends and the other within eight months after Sony Corporations fiscal year-end or semi-fiscal year-end). To claim this reduced rate or exemption, a non-resident Holder of ADSs will be required to file a proof of taxpayer status, residence and beneficial ownership (as applicable) and to provide other information or documents as may be required by the Depositary. A non-resident Holder who is entitled, under an applicable income tax treaty, to a reduced rate which is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law or an exemption from the withholding tax, but failed to submit the required application in advance will be entitled to claim the refund of taxes withheld in excess of the rate under an applicable tax treaty (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to a reduced treaty rate under the applicable income tax treaty) or the full amount of tax withheld (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to an exemption under the applicable income tax treaty) from the relevant Japanese tax authority. Sony Corporation does not assume any responsibility to ensure withholding at the reduced treaty rate or to ensure not withholding for shareholders who would be eligible under any applicable income tax treaty but do not follow the required procedures as stated above. Gains derived from the sale of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation outside Japan by a non-resident Holder holding such shares or ADSs as portfolio investors are, in general, not subject to Japanese income or corporation tax. U.S. holders are not subject to Japanese income or corporation tax with respect to such gains under the Treaty. Japanese inheritance and gift taxes at progressive rates may be payable by an individual who has acquired shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation as a legatee, heir or donee even though neither the individual nor the deceased nor donor is a Japanese resident. Holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of these taxes and, in the case of U.S. holders, the possible application of the Estate and Gift Tax Treaty between the U.S. and Japan. United States Taxation with respect to shares of Common Stock and ADSs The U.S. dollar amount of dividends received (prior to deduction of Japanese taxes) by a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock will be includable in income as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits of Sony Corporation as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by an individual prior to January 1, 2009 with respect to the ADSs or Common Stock will be subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent if the dividends are qualified dividends. Dividends paid on the Common Stock or ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if Sony Corporation was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, (a) a passive foreign investment company (PFIC), or (b) for the dividend paid prior to the 2005 tax year, a foreign personal holding company (FPHC) or foreign investment company (FIC). Based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, Sony Corporation believes that it was not treated as a PFIC, FPHC or FIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2003 or 2004 taxable year. In addition, based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and Sony Corporations current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market and shareholder data, Sony Corporation does not anticipate becoming a PFIC for the 2005 taxable year. The U.S. Treasury has announced its intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which holders of ADSs or Common Stock and intermediaries through whom such securities are held will be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers to treat dividends as qualified for tax reporting purposes. Because such procedures have not yet been issued, it is not clear whether Sony Corporation will be able to comply with them. Holders of ADSs and Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of the considerations discussed above and their own particular circumstances. 122 Table of Contents Subject to applicable limitations and special considerations discussed below, a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock of Sony Corporation will be entitled to a credit for Japanese tax withheld in accordance with the Tax Convention from dividends paid by Sony Corporation. For purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, dividends will be foreign source income, and will constitute passive or financial services income. Foreign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term of hedged positions and may not be allowed in respect of arrangements in which economic profit, after non-U.S. taxes, is insubstantial. Holders of Ads and Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of these rules in light of their particular circumstances. Dividends paid by Sony Corporation to U.S. corporate holders of ADSs or Common Stock will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. In general, a U.S. holder will recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Common Stock equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or disposition and the U.S. holders tax basis in the ADSs or Common Stock. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the ADSs or Common Stock have been held for more than one year on the date of the sale or disposition. The net amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder after May 5, 2003 and before January 1, 2009 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent. The net long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder before May 6, 2003 or after December 31, 2008 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20 percent.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Sonys normal course of business is continuously exposed to market fluctuation, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates or stock prices. Sony utilizes several derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements in order to hedge the potential downside risk on the cash flow from the normal course of business caused by market fluctuation. Sony uses foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts primarily to reduce the foreign exchange volatility risk that accounts receivable or accounts payable denominated in yen, U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies have through the normal course of Sonys worldwide business. Interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements are utilized to diversify funding conditions or to reduce funding costs, and in Financial Services segment, these transactions are used for asset liability management. Sony uses these derivative financial instruments mainly for risk-hedging purposes as described above, and few derivative transactions, such as bond futures and bond options are held or utilized for trading purposes in Financial Services segment. If hedge accounting cannot be applied because the accounts receivables or accounts payables to be hedged are not yet booked, or because cash flows 123 Table of Contents from derivative transactions do not coincide with the underlying exposures recorded on Sonys balance sheet, then Sony understands that such derivatives agreements should be subject to a mark-to-market evaluation and their unrealized gains or losses are recognized in earnings. In addition, Sony holds marketable securities such as straight bonds, convertible bonds, and stocks in yen or other currencies in the Financial Services segment in order to obtain interest income or capital gain on the financial assets under management. Sony understands that such investment in marketable securities is also subjected to market fluctuation. Sony measures the economic impact of market fluctuations on the value of derivatives agreements and marketable securities by using Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis in order to comply with Item 11 disclosure requirements. VaR in this context indicates the potential maximum amount of loss in fair value resulting from adverse market fluctuations for a selected period of time and at a selected level of confidence. The following table shows the results of VaR. These analyses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 indicate the potential maximum loss in fair value as predicted by the VaR analysis resulting from market fluctuations in one day at a 95% confidence level. The VaR of currency exchange rate risk principally consists of risks arising from the volatility of the exchange rates between the yen and U.S. dollar and between the yen and the euro, the currencies in which a significant amount of financial assets and liabilities and derivative transactions are maintained on a consolidated basis. The VaR of interest rate risk and stock price risk consists of risks arising from the volatility of the interest rates and stock prices against trading securities in the Financial Services segment. The net VaR for Sonys entire portfolio is smaller than the simple aggregate of VaR for each component of market risk. This is due to the fact that market risk factors such as currency exchange rates, interest rates, and stock prices are not completely independent, and potential profits and losses arising from each market risk may to some degree be mutually offsetting. The disclosed VaR amounts simply represents the calculated potential maximum loss on the specified date and does not necessarily indicate an estimate of actual or future loss.

Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds In June 2001, Sony Corporation issued shares of subsidiary tracking stock in Japan, the economic value of which is intended to be linked to the economic value of Sony Communication Network Corporation, a directly and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation, which is engaged in Internet-related services. Regarding the rights of holders of Sony Corporations Common Stock and subsidiary tracking stock, refer to Memorandum and Articles of Association in Item 10. Additional Information. Item 15. Controls and Procedures Sony has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Sonys management, including the Group Chief Executive Officer, Group Chief Strategy Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Sonys disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2005. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon Sonys evaluation, the Group Chief Executive Officer, Group Chief Strategy Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2005, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports Sony files and submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. There has been no change in Sonys internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Sonys internal control over financial reporting. Item 16. [Reserved] Item 16A.

(3) All Other Fees comprise fees for all other services not included in any of the other categories noted above. Audit Committees Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures Consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee of Sony Corporation is responsible for appointing, reviewing and setting compensation, retaining, and overseeing the work of Sonys independent auditor, so that the auditors independence will not be impaired, including overseeing any separate firm that audits the financial statements of any subsidiary if Sonys independent auditor expressly relies on the audit report of such firm. The Audit Committee has established a formal policy requiring pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor to Sony or any of its affiliates. The Audit Committee shall periodically review this policy with due regard to complying with laws and regulations of host countries where Sony is listed. Prior to the engagement of the independent auditor for the following fiscal years audit, management shall submit an application form to the Audit Committee for comprehensive pre-approval of all recurring services expected to be rendered during that year. In order to obtain comprehensive pre-approval, management shall provide sufficient information regarding each service so that each service can be classified into one of four categories (Audit, Audit-related, Tax, or All Other) as well as information regarding the fees expected to be budgeted for each service. Management shall describe each service in detail and indicate precisely and unambiguously the nature and scope of each particular service. Any additional services not contemplated in the application form shall require the Audit Committees separate pre-approval on an individual basis. The Audit Committee will approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees from changes in the scope of services to be provided or other circumstances. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a full-time member of the Audit Committee. The full-time member must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee or its designee shall establish procedures to assure that the independent auditor is aware in a timely manner of the services that have been pre-approved. 126 Table of Contents Item 16D.
