Risk Factors Food safety is the most significant risk to any company that operates in the restaurant industry. It has become the focus of increased government regulatory initiatives at the local, state and federal levels which adds higher compliance costs to the Company. To limit the Companys exposure to the risk of food contamination, management rigorously emphasizes and enforces the Companys food safety policies in all of the Companys restaurants, and at the commissary and food manufacturing plant that the Company operates for Big Boy restaurants. These policies are designed to work cooperatively with programs established by health agencies at all levels of government authority, including the federal Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) program. In addition, the Company makes use of ServSafe Training, a nationally recognized program developed by the National Restaurant Association. The ServSafe program provides accurate, up-to-date science-based information to all levels of restaurant workers on all aspects of food handling, from receiving and storing to preparing and serving. All restaurant managers are required to receive re-certification in ServSafe Training every five years. Other examples of risks and uncertainties facing the Company include, but are not limited to, the following:  intense competition for customers;  consumer perceptions of value, food quality and quality of service;  changing consumer preferences, particularly based on concerns with nutritional content of the Companys food or restaurant food in general;  the effects of higher gasoline prices on discretionary spending by consumers in restaurants;  changing demographics in neighborhoods where the Company operates restaurants;  changes in business strategy and development plans;  the rising cost of quality sites on which to build restaurants;  poor selection of restaurant sites;  changes in the supply and cost of food;  the effects of other inflationary pressures, especially higher costs for health care benefits and higher energy prices;  rolling power outages;  shortages of qualified labor;  seasonal weather conditions, particularly during the winter months of the third quarter;  natural disasters; fires or explosions;  criminal acts, including bomb threats, robberies, hostage taking, kidnapping and other violent crimes;  acts of terrorists or acts of war; and  civil disturbances and boycotts. Risks and uncertainties also include:  rising variable interest rates;  limitations on borrowing capacity;  legal claims;  changes in accounting standards;  estimates used in preparing financial statements and the inherent risk that future events affecting them may cause actual results to differ markedly; 11 Table of Contents  disruptions to the business during transitions to new computer software;  financial stability of technology vendors to support computer software over the long-term;  unauthorized access to information systems;  changes in governmental regulations regarding the environment;  exposure to penalties for potential violations of numerous governmental regulations in general, and immigration (I-9) and minor labor regulations in particular;  any future imposition by OSHA of costly ergonomics regulations on workplace safety;  legislative changes affecting labor law, especially increases in the federal or state minimum wage requirements; and  legislation or court rulings that result in changes to tax codes. The Company continually takes reasonable preventive measures to reduce its risks and uncertainties. However, the nature of some risks and uncertainties provides little control to the Company. The materialization of any of the risks and uncertainties identified herein, together with those risks not specifically listed or those that are presently unforeseen, could result in significant adverse effects on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows, which could include the permanent closure of any affected restaurant(s) with an impairment of assets charge taken against earnings, and could adversely affect the price at which shares of the Companys common stock trade.
