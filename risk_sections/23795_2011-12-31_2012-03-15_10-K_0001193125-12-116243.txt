ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) Our operations and properties in Florida could be adversely affected in the event of a hurricane, natural disaster, or other significant disruption. Our corporate headquarters and most of our properties are located in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. Depending on where any particular hurricane makes landfall, our properties in Florida could experience significant damage. In addition, the occurrence and frequency of hurricanes in Florida could also negatively impact demand for our real estate products because of consumer perceptions of hurricane risks. In addition to hurricanes, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, fires, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have am adverse effect on our ability to develop properties or realize income from our properties. If a hurricane, natural disaster or other significant disruption occurs, we may experience disruptions to our operations and properties, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. Competition and market conditions relating to golf operations could adversely affect our operating results. Golf operations face competition from similar nearby golf operations. Any new competitive golf operations that are developed close to our existing golf operations also may adversely impact results of operations. Golf operations are also subject to adverse market conditions, such as population trends and changing demographics, any of which could adversely affect results of operations. In addition, the golf operations may suffer if the economy weakens, if the popularity of golf decreases, or if unusual weather conditions or other factors cause a reduction in rounds played. Our golf operations are seasonal, primarily due to the impact of the winter tourist season and Florida summer heat and rain. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS NONE
