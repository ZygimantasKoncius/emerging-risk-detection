Item 1A. Risk FactorsIn evaluating our company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this annual report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of our common stock or preferred stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes.3Table of ContentsRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR PROPERTIESThere are inherent risks associated with real estate investments and with the real estate industry, each of which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and the value of our retail properties.Real estate investments are subject to various risks, fluctuations and cycles, many of which are beyond our control. Our operating and financial performance and the value of our properties can be affected by many of these factors, including the following:•national, regional and local economies, which may be negatively impacted by concerns about inflation, deflation, government deficits, high unemployment rates, decreased consumer confidence, industry slowdowns, reduced corporate profits, liquidity and other adverse business concerns;•local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of retail space or a reduction in demand for retail space resulting in vacancies or compromising our ability to rent space on favorable terms;•the convenience and quality of competing retail properties and other retailing options such as the Internet;•competition for investment opportunities from other real estate investors with significant capital, including other REITs, real estate operating companies and institutional investment funds;•adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and tenants of our properties, including bankruptcies, financial difficulties or lease defaults by our tenants;•fluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect our ability and the ability of buyers and tenants of our properties, to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;•changes in, and changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and governmental policies, including, without limitation, health, safety, environmental, zoning and tax laws, government fiscal policies and the ADA; and•civil unrest, acts of war, terrorist attacks and natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses.In addition, a period of economic slowdown or recession, declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults among our existing leases, and, consequently, our properties may fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet operating, debt service and other expenses. As a result, we may have to borrow amounts to cover fixed costs, and our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. As such, the per share trading prices of our Class A common stock and Series A preferred stock and our ability to satisfy our principal and interest obligations and to make distributions to our shareholders may be adversely affected.Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions where our properties are geographically concentrated, especially in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area in which we have a high concentration of properties.The economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial condition and results of operations. We are particularly susceptible to adverse economic and other developments in such areas, including increased unemployment, industry slowdowns, business layoffs or downsizing, relocations of businesses, decreased consumer confidence, changes in demographics, increases in real estate and other taxes, increased regulation and natural disasters. Specifically, as of December 31, 2013, approximately 12.2% of the GLA and approximately 15.5% of the annualized base rent (ABR) from our retail operating portfolio were represented by properties located in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area. As such, poor economic or market conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated may adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.We face significant competition in the leasing market, which may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of retail properties, many of whom own properties similar to, and in the same sub-markets as our properties. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants. In order to attract new tenants and retain existing tenants, we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge. As a result, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.4Table of ContentsWe may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire and rents associated with new leases may be less than expiring rents (lease roll-down), which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Approximately 5.6% of the total GLA in our retail operating portfolio, including our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures, was vacant as of December 31, 2013, excluding leases signed but not commenced. In addition, leases accounting for approximately 28.4% of the ABR in our retail operating portfolio, including our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures, as of December 31, 2013 are scheduled to expire between 2014 and 2016. We cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates, or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, lease inducements or incentives, early termination rights or below-market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. The rental rate spread between expiring leases and new leases may vary both from property to property and among different leased spaces within a single property. If the rental rates for our properties decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to improve our properties in order to retain and attract tenants, which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.In order to attract new tenants and retain existing tenants, we may be required to offer substantial tenant improvements or inducements, accommodate requests for renovations and other improvements or provide additional services to our tenants. Additionally, we may have to incur significant capital or other expenditures in order to retain tenants or attract new tenants in sufficient numbers. If we have to incur significant expenditures or are unable to make such expenditures, resulting in non-renewals by tenants upon expiration of their leases or the inability to obtain new tenants, it could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to collect rents from tenants or collect balances due on our leases from any tenants in bankruptcy may negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Substantially all of our income is derived from rentals of real property. Therefore, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations materially depend on the financial stability of our tenants and our ability to collect amounts due on our leases. If the sales of stores operating in our properties decline sufficiently, tenants may be unable to pay their existing minimum rents or other charges, or tenants may decline to extend or renew a lease upon its expiration on terms favorable to us, or at all, or may even exercise early termination rights (to the extent available). If a significant number of our tenants are unable to make their rental payments to us or otherwise meet their lease obligations, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, although minimum rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our properties files bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party, which could result in a reduction to our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.If any of our anchor tenants experience a downturn in their business or terminate their leases, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor tenant, particularly an anchor tenant with multiple store locations. Anchor tenants generally occupy significant amounts of square footage and pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property. Additionally, anchor tenants and “shadow” anchors, retailers occupying space that we do not own, in or adjacent to our properties, contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing a significant number of customers to a property. The closing of one or more anchor or “shadow” anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by, or reductions in rent from, other tenants whose leases permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result of the anchor store closing. In addition, we may be unable to re-let such space on similar terms and in a timely manner.Many of the leases at our retail properties contain provisions, which, if triggered, may allow tenants to pay reduced rent, cease operations or terminate their leases, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Many of the leases at our retail properties contain provisions that condition a tenant’s obligation to remain open, the amount of rent payable by the tenant or potentially the tenant’s obligation to remain in the lease, subject to certain factors, including: (i) the presence and continued operation of a certain anchor tenant or tenants, (ii) minimum occupancy levels at the applicable property 5Table of Contentsor (iii) tenant sales amounts. If such a provision is triggered by a failure of any of these or other applicable conditions, a tenant could have the right to cease operations at the applicable property, terminate its lease early or have its rent reduced. A tenant ceasing operations as a result of these provisions could result in decreased customer traffic and related decreased sales for our other tenants at that property, which may result in our other tenants being unable to pay their minimum rents or other charges. To the extent these provisions in our retail leases result in lower revenue or tenant sales, or in tenants’ rights to terminate their leases early, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our expenses may remain constant or increase, even if income from our properties decreases, causing our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected.Costs associated with our business, such as real estate taxes, state and local taxes, insurance, utilities, mortgage payments and corporate expenses, are relatively inflexible and generally do not decrease when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, a tenant fails to pay rent or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease. If we are unable to reduce our operating costs in response to revenue declines, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, inflationary price increases could result in increased operating costs or increases in assessed valuations could result in increased real estate taxes for us and our tenants and, the extent to which we are unable to pass along those increases or recover operating and real estate expenses and real estate taxes from tenants, could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.We depend on external sources of capital that are outside of our control, which may affect our ability to execute on strategic opportunities, satisfy our debt obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are generally required under the Code to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. In addition, as a REIT, we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, including any net capital gains. Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs (including redevelopment, acquisition, expansion and renovation activities, payments of principal and interest on and the refinancing of our existing debt, tenant improvements and leasing costs) from operating cash flow. Consequently, we may rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. We may not be able to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, in the time period we desire, or at all. Any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage, expose us to the risk of default and may impose operating restrictions on us, and any additional equity we raise could be dilutive to existing shareholders. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on:•general market conditions;•the market’s view of the quality of our assets and operating platform;•the market’s perception of our growth potential;•our current debt levels;•our current and expected future earnings; and•our cash flow and cash distributions.If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our principal and interest obligations or make the cash distributions to our shareholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT.We may be unable to sell a property at the time we desire and/or on favorable terms or at all, which could limit our ability to access capital through dispositions and could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond on our control, including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties, and we cannot predict the various market conditions affecting real estate investments that will exist at any particular time in the future. As a result of the uncertainty of market conditions, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell such properties at a profit, or at all. In addition, and subject to certain safe harbor provisions, the Code generally imposes a 100% tax on gain recognized by REITs upon the disposition of assets if the assets are held primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business, rather than for investment, which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be attractive from a pre-tax perspective. Accordingly, our ability to access capital through dispositions may be limited, which could limit our ability to fund future capital needs. Furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or 6Table of Contentsto make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot assure our shareholders that we will have sufficient funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements and, therefore, we may be unable to sell the asset or may have to sell it at a reduced price.We may be unable to complete acquisitions and, even if acquisitions are completed, we may fail to successfully operate acquired properties.We continue to evaluate the market of available properties and expect to continue to acquire properties when we believe strategic opportunities exist. Our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully operate or develop them is subject to the following risks:•we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with substantial capital, including from other REITs and institutional investment funds;•even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price;•we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including ones that we are subsequently unable to complete;•we may acquire properties that are not initially accretive to our results upon acquisition, and we may not successfully manage and lease those properties to meet our expectations;•we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms in the time period we desire, or at all;•even if we are able to finance acquisitions, our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments, if applicable;•we may spend more than budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations; and•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse to former owners, with respect to unknown liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants or other persons to former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.If we cannot finance property acquisitions in a timely manner and on favorable terms, or operate acquired properties to meet our financial expectations, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority.As of December 31, 2013, we held a portion of one development property with 51,600 square feet of GLA in one consolidated joint venture and six operating properties with 1,195,000 square feet of GLA in one unconsolidated joint venture. Our existing joint ventures and any additional joint venture arrangements in which we may engage in the future, are or could be subject to risks including the following:•we may not have exclusive control over the joint venture, which may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interest;•our partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which may force us to contribute more capital than we anticipated to cover the joint venture’s liabilities;•our partners may take actions that could jeopardize our REIT status, require us to pay taxes or subject properties owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those contemplated by the terms of the joint venture agreements;•disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business;•future joint venture agreements may require prior consent of our joint venture partners for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interest in the joint venture, which would restrict our ability to dispose of our interest in such a joint venture; and7Table of Contents•future joint venture agreements may contain buy-sell provisions pursuant to which one partner may initiate procedures requiring the other partner to choose between buying the other partner’s interest or selling its interest to that partner.If any of the foregoing were to occur, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our development, redevelopment and construction activities have inherent risks, which could adversely impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.As of December 31, 2013, we had one active development project, for which we had guaranteed $4,544 of the associated construction loan, and we periodically engage in redevelopment activities. To the extent we engage in these activities in the future, we may provide additional completion of construction and principal guaranties to lenders. In addition to the risks associated with real estate investments in general as described elsewhere, the risks associated with current and future development and redevelopment activities include:•significant time lag between commencement and stabilization subjecting us to greater risks due to fluctuations in the general economy and shifts in demographics;•expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed;•occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property that may not be sufficient to make the property profitable within the projected time frame;•failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms or at all;•higher than estimated construction or operating costs, including labor and material costs; and•inability to complete construction and lease-up on schedule due to a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals, acts of terror or other acts of violence, or acts of God (such as fires, earthquakes or floods), resulting in increased debt service obligations and construction costs.Additionally, the time frame required for development or redevelopment and lease-up of these properties means that we may not realize a significant cash return for several years. If any of the above events occur, the development of the properties may hinder our growth and have an adverse effect on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new development activities, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful, typically require substantial time and attention from management.We are subject to litigation that may negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory proceedings relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. For a further discussion of litigation risks, see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.A number of properties in our portfolio are subject to ground leases; if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease or are unable to renew a ground lease, we could be materially and adversely affected.We have 17 properties in our portfolio that are either completely or partially on land subject to ground leases. Accordingly, we only own a long-term leasehold or similar interest in those properties. If we are found to be in breach of a ground lease, we could lose the right to use the property. In addition, unless we can purchase a fee interest in the underlying land and improvements or extend the terms of these leases before or at their expiration, as to which no assurance can be given, we will lose our right to operate these properties and our interest in the improvements upon expiration of the ground leases. Assuming that we exercise all available options to extend the terms of our ground leases, all of our ground leases will expire between 2043 and 2107. However, in certain cases, our ability to exercise such options is subject to the condition that we are not in default under the terms of the ground lease at the time that we exercise such options, and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to exercise our options at such time. If we were to lose the right to use a property due to a breach or non-renewal of the ground lease, we would be unable to derive income from such property, which could materially and adversely affect us.8Table of ContentsUninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Each tenant is responsible for insuring its goods and demised premises and, in some circumstances, may be required to reimburse us for a share of the cost of acquiring comprehensive insurance for the property, including casualty, liability, fire and extended coverage customarily obtained for similar properties in amounts which have been determined as sufficient to cover reasonably foreseeable losses. Tenants on a net lease typically are required to pay all insurance costs associated with their space. However, material losses may occur in excess of insurance proceeds with respect to any property. Additionally, losses of a catastrophic nature including loss due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, other natural disasters, pollution or environmental matters may be considered uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. In the instance of a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, a significant portion of the capital invested in the damaged property could be lost, as well as the anticipated future revenue of the property, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it impractical or undesirable to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties are irreparably damaged. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable costs in the future, as the costs associated with property and casualty renewals may be higher than anticipated.A number of our properties are located in areas which are susceptible to, and could be significantly affected by, natural disasters that could cause significant damage to our properties. For example, many of our properties are located in coastal regions, and would therefore be affected by any future increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes and tropical storms. In addition, a number of our properties are located in California and other regions that are especially susceptible to earthquakes.In addition, the upcoming vote pertaining to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) or actual terrorist acts could sharply increase the premium paid for this coverage. Further, mortgage lenders, in some cases, insist that specific coverage against terrorism be purchased by commercial property owners as a condition for providing mortgage loans. It is uncertain whether such insurance policies will be available, or available at reasonable costs, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We cannot assure our shareholders that we will have adequate coverage for such losses and, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We may incur significant costs complying with the ADA and similar laws, which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe the properties in our portfolio substantially comply with the present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance, nor can we be assured that requirements will not change. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. If one or more of the properties in our portfolio is not in compliance with the ADA, we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance, and it could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties, or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA and any other legislation, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may incur liability with respect to contaminated property or incur costs to comply with environmental laws, which may negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation, remediation, natural resource damages or third party liability for personal injury or property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell, redevelop, or lease such property or to borrow using the property as collateral. Environmental laws also may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which that property 9Table of Contentsmay be used or how businesses may be operated on that property. Some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from current or prior uses of the property or adjacent properties for commercial or industrial purposes. Such contamination may arise from spills of petroleum or hazardous substances or releases from tanks used to store such materials. We also may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site disposal or treatment facilities when we arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such facilities, without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so. The environmental site assessments described in Item 1. “Business — Environmental Matters” have a limited scope and may not reveal all potential environmental liabilities. Further, material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability beyond what was known at the time the site assessment was conducted.In addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of waste and underground and aboveground storage tanks. Noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us or our tenants to liability. These environmental liabilities could affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. Moreover, changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations, or those of our tenants, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us.As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. For example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or ACM. Environmental, health and safety laws require that ACM be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. These requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. In addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to ACM or releases of ACM into the environment.When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants, or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.We cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.We may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets resulting in the recognition of impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.A decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment charge against such assets under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be unrecoverable. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized aggregate impairment charges related to investment properties of $92,033, $25,842 and $39,981, respectively (including $32,547, $24,519 and $32,331, respectively, reflected in discontinued operations). We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment charges in the future.Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.We depend on the efforts and expertise of our senior management team to manage our day-to-day operations and strategic business direction. We have retention agreements with the members of our executive management team, however, we cannot guarantee their continued service. The loss of their services, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could have an adverse effect on our operations.10Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO OUR DEBT FINANCINGWe had $2,299,439 of consolidated indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2013, which could adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility.As of December 31, 2013, we had $2,299,439 (excluding mortgage premium of $1,175 and discount of $(981), net of accumulated amortization, and mortgages payable of $6,435 associated with one investment property classified as held for sale) of aggregate consolidated indebtedness outstanding, the majority of which was secured by one or more of our properties. As a result of this indebtedness, we are required to use a significant portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which could have important consequences to us, including:•limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, debt service requirements and capital expenditures, or for other purposes;•limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business, to react to competitive pressures and to capitalize on business opportunities, including the acquisition of additional properties, or use operating cash flow in other areas of our business;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates and changes in government regulation;•limiting our ability or increasing the costs to refinance indebtedness if we so choose, including the $49,825 and $437,403 of our indebtedness maturing in 2014 and 2015, respectively;•limiting our ability to enter into financing and hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom we can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions;•we may be forced to dispose of one or more properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms; and•we may be forced to sell additional equity securities at prices that may be dilutive to existing shareholders.If any one of these events were to occur, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.A significant portion of our indebtedness is secured by properties and defaults may result in foreclosure. In addition, mortgages sometimes include cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions that increase the risk that more than one property may be affected by a default.As of December 31, 2013, we had a total of $1,684,439 (excluding mortgage premium of $1,175 and discount of $(981), net of accumulated amortization, and mortgages payable of $6,435 associated with one investment property classified as held for sale) of indebtedness secured by 155 of our 231 operating properties. As a result, we are subject to the risk of property loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the property securing the loan for which we are in default.In the event that we default on mortgages in the future, either as a result of ceasing to make debt service payments or the failure to meet applicable covenants, the lenders may accelerate our debt obligations, foreclose on the properties that secure their loans and/or take control of our properties that secure their loans and collect rents and other property income. In the event of a default under any of our recourse indebtedness, we would be liable for any deficiency between the value of the property securing such loan and the principal and accrued interest on the loan. In addition, as a result of cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions contained in certain of our mortgage loans, a default under one mortgage loan could result in a default on other indebtedness and cause us to lose other better performing properties, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Further, for tax purposes, a foreclosure of any nonrecourse mortgage on any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on the foreclosure without accompanying cash proceeds. As a result, we may be required to identify and utilize other sources for distributions to our shareholders of that income, including but not limited to, the issuance of a stock dividend that qualifies as a distribution for federal income tax purposes, in order to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code.11Table of ContentsOur cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by financial and other covenants and other provisions under the credit agreement governing our unsecured revolving line of credit and unsecured term loan or other debt agreements.On May 13, 2013, we entered into our third amended and restated unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions to provide for an unsecured credit facility aggregating $1,000,000, consisting of a $550,000 unsecured revolving line of credit which matures on May 12, 2017 and a $450,000 unsecured term loan which matures on May 11, 2018. The credit agreement governing this unsecured credit facility requires compliance with certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, maximum unsecured, secured and total leverage ratios, minimum fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage ratios and a minimum consolidated net worth requirement. The credit agreement also limits our distributions to the greater of 95% of funds from operations (FFO), as defined in the credit agreement (which equals FFO, as set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Funds From Operations,” excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items, impairment charges not already excluded from FFO and other non-cash charges) or the amount necessary for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. The unsecured revolving line of credit and unsecured term loan also contain customary events of default, including but not limited to, non-payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, breaches of covenants, defaults on any of our recourse indebtedness in excess of $50,000 or any non-recourse indebtedness in excess of $150,000 in the aggregate subject to certain carveouts and bankruptcy or other insolvency events. These provisions could limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, obtain additional funds needed to address cash shortfalls or pursue growth opportunities or transactions that would provide substantial returns to our shareholders. In addition, a breach of these covenants or other events of default would allow the lenders to accelerate payment of advances under the credit agreement. If payment is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full and, as a result, such an event may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.In connection with the debt financing transaction of IW JV 2009, LLC (IW JV), a previously consolidated joint venture that became wholly-owned in April 2012 which owns a portfolio of 55 investment properties, we entered into a lockbox and cash management agreement pursuant to which substantially all of the income generated by the IW JV properties is deposited directly into a lockbox account established by the lender. In the event of a default or the debt service coverage ratio falling below a set amount, the cash management agreement provides that excess cash flow will be swept into a cash management account for the benefit of the lender and held as additional security after the payment of interest and approved property operating expenses. Cash will not be distributed to us from these accounts, in the event of a default, until the earlier of a cash sweep event cure or the repayment of the mortgage loan and senior and junior mezzanine notes. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the terms of the cash management agreement; however, if an event of default were to occur, we may be forced to borrow funds in order to make distributions to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.Given the restrictions in our debt covenants on these and other activities, we may be significantly limited in our operating and financial flexibility and may be limited in our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities in the future.Our consolidated indebtedness may limit our ability to refinance debt and may expose us to the adverse effects of future increases in interest rates.If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt at maturity, it may be necessary to refinance the debt. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancings than our interest rates at maturity, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we are not successful in refinancing our debt when it becomes due, we may default under our loan obligations, enter into foreclosure proceedings or be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, any of which might affect our ability to service other debt and meet our other obligations. In addition to the risks associated with future refinancings, future increases in interest rates could cause our borrowing costs to rise, which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREOur board of directors may change significant corporate policies without shareholder approval.Our investment, financing, distribution and operations policies are determined by our board of directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of the board of directors without a vote of our shareholders. As a result, the ability of our shareholders to control our policies and practices is extremely limited. We could make investments and engage in business activities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this report. In addition, our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes 12Table of Contentsare consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). A change in these policies could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.We could increase the number of authorized shares of stock and issue stock without shareholder approval.Subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, our charter authorizes our board of directors, without shareholder approval, to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock or the number of authorized shares of stock of any class or series, to issue authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to set the preferences, rights and other terms of such classified or unclassified shares. As a result, we may issue series or classes of common stock or preferred stock with preferences, dividends, powers and rights, voting or otherwise, that are senior to, or otherwise conflict with, the rights of holders of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our shareholders may believe is in their best interests.Provisions of our charter may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company.Our charter provides that no person may beneficially own more than 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common stock or 9.8% in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of our capital stock. While these charter provisions help us to ensure we maintain our REIT status, these ownership limitations may prevent an acquisition of control of our company by a third party without our board of directors’ approval, even if our shareholders believe the change in control is in their best interests.Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes of control in us, which could lower the values of our Class A common stock and Series A preferred stock.Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, may have the effect of inhibiting or deterring a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including:•“business combination” provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an “interested shareholder” (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our then outstanding voting shares) or an affiliate of an interested shareholder for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, and thereafter, may impose special shareholder voting requirements unless certain minimum price conditions are satisfied; and•“control share” provisions that provide that “control shares” of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the shareholder, entitle the shareholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a “control share acquisition” (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of outstanding “control shares”) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.We have opted out of these provisions of the MGCL, in the case of the business combination provisions of the MGCL by resolution of our board of directors, and in the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL pursuant to a provision in our bylaws. However, following our opt out, in the future, only upon the approval of our shareholders, our board of directors may by resolution elect to opt in to the business combination provisions of the MGCL and we may, only upon the approval of our shareholders, by amendment to our bylaws, opt in to the control share provisions of the MGCL.Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our board of directors, without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses, including adopting a classified board. Such takeover defenses may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our common shareholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price.In addition, the provisions of our charter on removal of directors and the advance notice provisions of our bylaws could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or that our shareholders may believe to be in their best interests. Likewise, if our company’s board of directors were to opt 13Table of Contentsin to the business combination provisions of the MGCL or the provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL, or if the provision in our bylaws opting out of the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL were rescinded by our board of directors and our shareholders, these provisions of the MGCL could have similar anti-takeover effects.Our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions that you do not believe are in your best interests.Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she satisfies his or her duties to us and our shareholders. As permitted by the MGCL, our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to us and our shareholders for monetary damages, except for liability resulting from:•actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or•a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated.In addition, our charter and bylaws and indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and certain of our officers require us to indemnify our directors and officers, among others, for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist. Accordingly, in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of our directors or officers impede the performance of our company, your ability to recover damages from such director or officer will be limited. In addition, we will be obligated to advance the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers with indemnification agreements, and may, in the discretion of our board of directors, advance the defense costs incurred by our employees and other agents, in connection with legal proceedings.Our charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our shareholders to effect changes to our management.Our charter provides that a director may only be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. Vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. These requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control of our company that is in the best interests of our shareholders.RISKS RELATING TO OUR REIT STATUSFailure to qualify as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for distribution to our shareholders and materially and adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.We believe that we have been organized, owned and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2003, and that our intended manner of ownership and operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified or will qualify as such. Shareholders should be aware that qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such qualification.If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distributions to our shareholders because:•we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;•we could be subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax;•we could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and•unless we are entitled to relief under certain U.S. federal income tax laws, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT.14Table of ContentsIn addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, it could result in default under certain of our indebtedness agreements. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, taxes on net income from certain “prohibited transactions,” taxes on income from certain activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. In addition, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Also, our consolidated TRS will be subject to regular corporate U.S. federal, state and local taxes. To the extent that we conduct operations outside of the United States, our operations would subject us to applicable foreign taxes as well. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our cash flow.Failure to make required distributions would subject us to U.S. federal corporate income tax.In order to qualify as a REIT, we generally are required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, each year to our shareholders. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the Code. Moreover, our unsecured revolving line of credit and unsecured term loan may limit our distributions to the minimum amount required to maintain our REIT status. Specifically, they limit our distributions to the greater of 95% of FFO as defined in the credit agreement (which equals FFO, as set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Funds From Operations,” excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items, impairment charges other than those already excluded from FFO and other non-cash charges) or the amount necessary for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. To the extent these limits prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to income tax, and potentially excise tax, on the retained amounts.We may be required to borrow funds to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT and to meet the REIT distribution requirements, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis or sell assets, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings or sales. Our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which Section 162(m) of the Code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments. The insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise debt in order to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT.Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.Certain qualified dividends paid by corporations to individuals, trusts and estates that are U.S. shareholders are taxed at capital gain rates. Dividends of current and accumulated earnings and profits payable by REITs, however, are taxed at ordinary income rates as opposed to the capital gains rate. Dividends payable by REITs in excess of these earnings and profits generally are treated as a non-taxable reduction of the shareholders’ basis in the shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable gain. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs, including us, to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends.Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments.To qualify as a REIT, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our shareholders and the ownership of our capital stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make and refrain from engaging in certain activities. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our performance.15Table of ContentsIn addition, if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments.We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition.At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our shareholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.You may be restricted from acquiring or transferring certain amounts of our stock.In order to maintain our REIT qualification, among other requirements, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code to include certain kinds of entities, during the last half of any taxable year, other than the first year for which we made a REIT election. To assist us in qualifying as a REIT, our charter contains an aggregate stock ownership limit of 9.8%, a common stock ownership limit of 9.8% and a preferred stock ownership limit of 9.8%. Generally, any shares of our stock owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the aggregate stock ownership limit, any shares of common stock owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the common stock ownership limit and any shares of preferred stock owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the preferred stock ownership limit.If anyone attempts to transfer or own shares of stock in a way that would violate the aggregate stock ownership limit, the common stock ownership limit or the preferred stock ownership limit, unless such ownership limits have been waived by our board of directors, or in a way that would prevent us from continuing to qualify as a REIT, those shares instead will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and will be either redeemed by us or sold to a person whose ownership of the shares will not violate the aggregate stock ownership limit, the common stock ownership limit or the preferred stock ownership limit. If this transfer to a trust fails to prevent such a violation or our disqualification as a REIT, then the initial intended transfer or ownership will be null and void from the outset. Anyone who acquires or owns shares of stock in violation of the aggregate stock ownership limit, the common stock ownership limit or the preferred stock ownership limit, unless such ownership limit or limits have been waived by our board of directors, or in violation of the other restrictions on transfer or ownership in our charter, bears the risk of a financial loss when the shares of common or preferred stock are redeemed or sold, as applicable, if the market price of our common or preferred stock falls between the date of purchase and the date of redemption or sale.Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.The REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Generally, income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, provided we properly identify the hedge pursuant to the applicable sections of the Code and Treasury regulations. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by it or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in our TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for use against future taxable income in our TRS.The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without shareholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders.Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our shareholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to be a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders.16Table of ContentsGENERAL INVESTMENT RISKSThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile.The U.S. stock markets, including the NYSE on which our Class A common stock is listed, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of shares of our Class A common stock is likely to be similarly volatile, and investors in shares of our Class A common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. We cannot assure you that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.A number of factors could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock, including:•actual or anticipated changes in our operating results and changes in expectations of future financial performance;•our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;•our strategic decisions, such as acquisitions, dispositions, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;•adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we incur in the future;•increases in market interest rates or decreases in our distributions to shareholders that lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;•equity issuances by us or the perception that such issuances may occur;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•additions or departures of key management personnel;•publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts;•speculation in the press or investment community;•the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry;•changes in accounting principles;•our failure to satisfy the listing requirements of the NYSE;•our failure to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act;•our failure to qualify as a REIT; and•general market conditions, including factors unrelated to our performance.In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their common stock. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.Increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our common and preferred stock.One of the factors that may influence the price of our common and preferred stock is the dividend yield on our common and preferred stock relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates rise, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, prospective purchasers or holders of shares of our common stock may expect a higher distribution rate. Higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds being available for distribution and, in fact, would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease our funds available for distribution. We therefore may not be able, or we may not choose, to provide a higher distribution rate on our common or preferred stock. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our properties. This could result in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock and Series A preferred stock.17Table of ContentsFuture offerings of debt securities, which would be senior to our common and preferred stock, or equity securities, which would dilute the interests of our existing shareholders and may be senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market prices of our common and preferred stock.We have issued one series of preferred stock and have established an at-the-market (ATM) equity program under which we may sell shares of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2013, we had Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $115,165 remaining available for sale under our ATM equity program. In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities, including medium term notes, senior or subordinated notes and classes of preferred or common stock. Debt securities or shares of preferred stock will generally be entitled to receive interest payments or distributions, both current and in connection with any liquidation or sale, prior to the holders of our common stock. We are not required to offer any such additional debt or equity securities to existing common shareholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, offerings of common stock or other equity securities may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders. Future offerings of debt or equity securities, or the perception that such offerings may occur, may reduce the market prices of our common and preferred stock and/or the distributions that we pay with respect to our common stock. Because we may generally issue any such debt or equity securities in the future without obtaining the consent of our shareholders, our shareholders will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market prices of our common and preferred stock and diluting their proportionate ownership.The change of control conversion feature of our Series A preferred stock may make it more difficult for a party to take over our company or discourage a party from taking over our company.Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in our Articles Supplementary for our Series A preferred stock), holders of our Series A preferred stock will have the right unless prior to the change of control conversion date (as defined in our Articles Supplementary for our Series A preferred stock), or in the event that we have provided notice of our election to redeem our Series A preferred stock, to convert some or all of their Series A preferred stock into shares of our common stock, or equivalent value of alternative consideration. Upon such a conversion, the holders will be limited to a maximum number of shares of our common stock equal to 4.1736, subject to certain adjustments, multiplied by the number of shares of Series A preferred stock converted. In addition, the change of control conversion feature of our Series A preferred stock may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying, deferring or preventing certain change of control transactions of our company under circumstances that shareholders may otherwise believe are in their best interests.Our ability to pay dividends is limited by the requirements of Maryland law.Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and Series A preferred stock is limited by the laws of the State of Maryland. Under applicable Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally may not make a distribution if, after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as the debts become due in the usual course of business, or the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the corporation’s charter provides otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. Accordingly, we generally may not make a distribution on our common stock or Series A preferred stock if, after giving effect to the distribution, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus, unless the terms of such class or series provide otherwise, the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of shares of any class or series of preferred stock then outstanding, if any, with preferences senior to those of our common stock or Series A preferred stock, respectively.Item 1B.
