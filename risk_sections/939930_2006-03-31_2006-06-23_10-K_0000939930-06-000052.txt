ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) Risks Relating to the Tobacco Industry (Continued) Legislative and regulatory initiatives could reduce consumption of consumer tobacco products and demand for our services. (Continued) A number of foreign nations also have taken steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion, to increase taxes on cigarettes and to discourage cigarette smoking. In some cases, such restrictions are more onerous than those in the United States. For example, advertising and promotion of cigarettes has been banned or severely restricted for a number of years in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Singapore and other countries. Further, in May of 2003, the World Health Organization adopted a treaty, the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, which requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would require, among other things, specific actions to prevent youth smoking; restrict or prohibit tobacco product marketing; inform the public about the health consequences of smoking and the benefits of quitting; regulate the content of tobacco products; impose new package warning requirements including the use of pictorial or graphic images; eliminate cigarette smuggling and counterfeit cigarettes; restrict smoking in public places; increase and harmonize cigarette excise taxes; abolish duty-free tobacco sales; and permit and encourage litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. The treaty will take effect after forty countries ratify it and must be implemented by national laws in the ratifying nations. To date, 168 parties have signed the treaty, and 129 countries have ratified the treaty. Due to the present regulatory and legislative environment, a substantial risk exists that past growth trends in tobacco product sales may not continue and that existing sales may decline. We have been, and continue to be, subject to governmental investigations into, and litigation concerning, leaf tobacco industry buying practices. The leaf tobacco industry, from time to time, has been the subject of government investigations regarding trade practices. For example, in 1998 Alliance One was the subject of an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice into certain buying practices alleged to have occurred in the industry. More recently, we were named defendants in the DeLoach, et al. v. Philip Morris Companies Inc. et al., antitrust class action litigation alleging a conspiracy to rig bids in the tobacco auction markets. Alliance One, along with all but one of the other defendants, entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs which received final approval, and which accorded it a full release from all the claims. In exchange for such settlement, Alliance One contributed $6.0 million towards a larger total settlement agreement. Since October 2001, the Directorate General for Competition (DGCOMP) of the European Commission (EC) has been conducting an administrative investigation into certain tobacco buying and selling practices alleged to have occurred within the leaf tobacco industry in some countries within the European Union, including Spain, Italy, Greece and potentially other countries. Alliance One and Standard subsidiaries in Spain, Italy and Greece have been subject to these investigations. In 2004, the EC fined Alliance One and its Spanish subsidiaries €4.4 million (US$5.7 million) solely relating to the investigations in Spain. In respect of the Italian investigation, in October 2005, the EC announced that Alliance One and Mindo (its former subsidiary) have been assessed a fine in the aggregate amount of €10 million (US$12 million) and that, in addition, Alliance One and Trans catab, a subsidiary of Standard prior to its merger into DIMON, have been assessed a fine in the aggregate amount of €14 million (US$16.8 million). Several tobacco processors, growers and agricultural associations that were the subject of the investigation in Italy were assessed fines in various amounts totaling €56 million (US$67 million), inclusive of the fines imposed on Alliance One and its subsidiaries. Alliance One, along with the applicable subsidiaries, have appealed the decisions of the Commission with respect to Spain and Italy to the Court of First Instance of the European Commission for the annulment or modification of the decision; but the outcome of the appeals process as to both timing and results is uncertain. In March 2005, the EC informed Alliance One that it had closed its investigation in relation to the Greek leaf tobacco industry buying and selling practices. In relation to these investigations into certain tobacco buying and selling practices, the DGCOMP could decide to pursue investigations into other countries and additional fines may be assessed in those countries. The Company has recently been made aware of a review by the Malawi Government of the operation of its tobacco auction markets. Although the Governments preliminary report suggests that there may have been violations by the leaf dealer industry of certain Malawi competition laws, the review is at an early stage and it is not possible to predict its outcome or its possible impact on the Company. The Company will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities and is conducting its own internal investigation. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. -16-
