SunOpta Inc. 3 December 31, 2008  10-K PART I Item 1. Business Overview SunOpta Inc., incorporated in 1973, has three business groups: SunOpta Food Group (the Food Group), which accounted for approximately 91% of 2008 consolidated revenues. Opta Minerals Inc. (Opta Minerals), which is owned 66.2% by SunOpta and which represented 9% of consolidated 2008 revenues. SunOpta BioProcess Group (SBI or SunOpta BioProcess), which represented less than 0.5% of 2008 consolidated revenues. The Food Group operates in the natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health product sectors, which we believe offer above average growth opportunities compared to other segments of the food industry. The Food Group is comprised of five operating groups: the SunOpta Grains and Foods Group (the Grains and Food Group), the SunOpta Ingredients Group (the Ingredients Group), the SunOpta Fruit Group (the Fruit Group), the SunOpta International Sourcing and Trading Group (the International Sourcing and Trading Group), and the SunOpta Distribution Group (the Distribution Group). These groups use a combination of specific and vertically integrated seed to table capabilities and preferred sourcing contracts to serve the fast growing natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health product sectors. Opta Minerals processes, sells and distributes silica-free loose abrasives and other specialty industrial minerals to the foundry, steel, roofing shingle and marine/bridge cleaning industries; sources specialty sands and garnets for the water filtration industry; and recycles inorganic materials under special permits from government authorities at both its Waterdown, Ontario and Norfolk, Virginia sites. In February 2005, approximately 29% of Opta Minerals was sold as part of an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), trading under the symbol OPM. As part of the acquisition of Newco a.s. in 2007, Opta Minerals issued 1,000,000 Common Shares which when combined with the issue of employee option grants has diluted SunOptas equity ownership in Opta Minerals to approximately 66.2% . SunOpta BioProcess operates from facilities in Brampton, Ontario and pilot plant facilities in Waterdown, Ontario. SunOpta BioProcess provides equipment and process solutions for the biomass conversion industry, from process development and design through the sale of proprietary biomass processing technology with a current focus on applications in the production of cellulosic ethanol. SunOpta BioProcess offers extensive scientific and engineering capabilities in the design and development of biomass conversion solutions, and holds a number of patents on its proprietary steam explosion technology and related processes. This technology has wide potential in cellulosic ethanol, pulp, and food ingredients processing and offers licensing and applications potential. The proprietary steam explosion technology uses high temperature and pressure rather than chemicals to process biomass which can then be used to produce various products for further processing. SunOpta Inc. 4 December 31, 2008  10-K Segment Information Each of our groups - the Food Group, Opta Minerals and SBI - reports as a separate segment. Our assets, operations and employees are principally located in North America, and, more recently, in Europe as a result of our 2007 acquisition of Newco a.s. (Newco) and our acquisitions in 2008 of The Organics Corporation (TOC) and MCP Mg-Serbien SAS (MCP). Financial information for each segment describing revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets for the last three fiscal years as well as financial information about geographic areas for the last three fiscal years is set forth in note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Major Developments in 2008 and 2009 In 2008, we wrote down inventories in the SunOpta Fruit Groups Fruit Specialties (formerly, Berry Operations) to net realizable value and made other adjustments. These adjustments delayed the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K for 2007, in which we reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and required that we restate quarterly financial results for 2007. We conducted an in-depth review of internal controls and accounting practices at the SunOpta Fruit Groups Fruit Specialties, and our Audit Committee engaged independent counsel and independent accountants to help it investigate and assess the Fruit Specialties accounting practices and internal controls. The Audit Committee completed its investigation and the Board of Directors accepted recommendations to remediate internal controls and related processes. The remediation of internal control weaknesses, including variations from the Audit Committees original recommendations, is discussed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. In connection with our restatement, we received letters from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) requesting additional information, and we received an additional request from the Ontario Securities Commission for information regarding our stock option granting process. While the OSC has completed its formal investigation of the write-down and restatements without any enforcement action; the SEC has requested additional information and interviews with certain current and past employees, and we continue to cooperate with the requests from the SEC. We have also provided the information requested by the OSC regarding our stock option granting process and continue to cooperate with further requests as received. After we announced our inventory write-down, we and certain of our officers (one of whom is a director) and a former director were named as defendants in several proposed class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired securities of SunOpta between May 8, 2007 and January 25, 2008. The lawsuits allege, among other things, violations of United States federal securities laws. These lawsuits have been consolidated into one class action with a lead plaintiff. Similarly, one proposed class action lawsuit has also been filed in Canada in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on behalf of shareholders who acquired securities of SunOpta between May 8, 2007 and January 25, 2008 against SunOpta and certain officers, one of whom is also a director, alleging misrepresentation, and proposing to seek leave from the Ontario court to bring statutory misrepresentation civil liability claims under Ontarios Securities Act. Motions for class certification of the Ontario action, and leave to pursue statutory claims under Ontarios Securities Act, are scheduled to be heard in May 2009. We intend to vigorously defend these actions. On April 2, 2008, we acquired the outstanding shares of The Organics Corporation, a global supplier of a wide variety of globally sourced organic food ingredients including frozen and fresh fruits and vegetables, dried fruits, coffee, cocoa, cereals, rice, soy, beans, pulses, seeds, nuts, oils, dairy products, seasonings, and sweeteners. TOCs organic foods sourcing and processing expertise complements ours, and we expect the integration of TOC into our operations will result in efficiencies and cost savings, and will expand our sourcing and processing opportunities around the globe. We appointed Mr. Tony Tavares as Vice President and Chief Operating Officer effective June 2, 2008. Mr. Tavares has operational and strategic responsibility for the SunOpta Food Group operations and global supply chain initiatives. He brings over 20 years of food industry experience to this role. SunOpta Inc. 5 December 31, 2008  10-K On July 9, 2008, Opta Minerals Inc. expanded its business capabilities in Europe by acquiring 67% of the outstanding common shares of MCP Mg-Serbien SAS ("MCP"), a French company. The transaction included an option to acquire the remaining 33% minority interest on similar terms. For fiscal 2007, MCP recorded revenues of approximately $6.3 million from the sale of ground magnesium products. The acquisition complements existing operations which supply a wide range of magnesium based desulphurization products in the United States, Canada and Europe from operations in Indiana, Ontario and Slovakia. We amended our credit facility on July 11, 2008, primarily to adjust certain covenant ratio calculations and ratio targets. In connection with the amendment, we received a waiver from our lending syndicate for failure to achieve certain ratios for the three month period ended March 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2007. We received a prior waiver from our lenders with respect to covenant ratios on April 30, 2008. On September 25, 2008, at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Mr. Douglas Greene and Mr. Victor Hepburn were appointed to the Board of Directors. Mr. Steven Townsend, Mr. James Rifenbergh and Mr. Joe Riz did not stand for re-election as directors of SunOpta and thus were relieved of their duties the day of the Annual Meeting. Mr. Greene brings over 25 years experience in the natural and organics food industry to the board and Mr. Hepburn brings over 30 years of diverse financial and general business experience to the Board. On October 7, 2008, we adopted a shareholder rights plan (the Rights Plan), the purpose of which is to provide sufficient time to develop and implement alternatives to maximize value for all shareholders if we receive an unsolicited bid for control of SunOpta and to enhance our ability to prevent unfair acquisition tactics. The Rights Plan is not intended to prevent take-over bids, but is designed to ensure offers are fair. It allows persons seeking control of SunOpta to make bids which provide, among other things, that (1) all shareholders are entitled to participate, (2) the bid remains open for an initial period of 60 days, and (3) more than 50% of the shares held by independent shareholders must be tendered and not withdrawn during this period. Unless the Board of Directors determines otherwise, if a bid does not meet the permitted bid provisions and an unsolicited bidder acquires more than 20% of our outstanding shares, each independent shareholders would have a right to receive, upon exercise his or her right, that number of shares having a value equal to two times the Exercise Price (as defined in the Rights Plan). The Rights Plan is subject to the approval of our shareholders on or before April 2, 2009. If the Rights Plan is not approved by shareholders, it will terminate. On November 17, 2008, our Audit Committee appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm immediately following the resignation of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. This decision was taken after a careful and thorough assessment of engagement proposals received from independent registered international public accounting firms. On November 25, 2008, Mr. Jay Amato was appointed to the Board of Directors. Mr. Amato has a strong business and information technology background and has served as an executive at a number of media and information technology businesses. Also on November 25, 2008 Mr. Robert Fetherstonaugh resigned from the Board due to personal commitments. On December 23, 2008, we announced that the arbitrator rendered his decision in the arbitration proceedings between the SunOpta BioProcess Group and Abener Energia S.A. ("Abener") regarding the Equipment Supply and Engineering Services Agreement related to a bioethanol plant being constructed in Salamanca, Spain. The ruling of the arbitrator partially allowed Abener's claim and ordered payment be made to Abener in the amount of EUR 1,329,898. The arbitrator's decision resolved certain disputes related to the interpretation of contractual business terms and did not reflect on the effectiveness of SBIs products and technologies or the value of its intellectual property. SBIs claim for damages against Abengoa BioEnergy New Technologies, Inc., a related party to Abener, continues in arbitration and a decision is expected in mid-2009. SunOpta Inc. 6 December 31, 2008  10-K We have implemented a number of cost-saving measures as a result of general economic conditions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing to the end of February 2009, we have reduced employment by 36 salaried positions and 66 hourly workers. We temporarily closed our Salinas, California and Rosarito, Mexico fruit processing facilities and permanently closed a sales office within the Fruit Group operations in South Carolina and an International Sourcing and Trading Group sales office in Austria. We intend to maintain 2009 salaries at 2008 levels and continue to explore additional measures to improve our ability to adapt during the economic downturn. We appointed Mr. Eric Davis Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective March 16, 2009. Mr. Davis is a Chartered Accountant and brings over 25 years of diverse global finance and accounting experience to this position. In this role, Mr. Davis will assume responsibility for financial reporting, tax, banking and treasury, investor relations and special projects. SunOpta Inc. 7 December 31, 2008  10-K SUNOPTA FOOD GROUP The SunOpta Food Group has been built through the acquisition of thirty-one business operations and through significant internal growth. The Food Group is a vertically integrated natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health products company, with global operations, serving domestic and international markets and representing approximately 91% of SunOptas consolidated revenues. Below is a summary listing of acquisitions and significant facilities acquired since inception of the SunOpta Food Group. See note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of acquisitions during 2008 and 2007.

(Fruit Group) August 7, 2007 Operating assets of a soymilk manufacturing facility in Heuvelton, New York (Grains and Foods Group) December 6, 2007 Neo-Nutritionals, Inc. (Distribution Group) April 2, 2008 The Organic Corporation (International Sourcing and Trading Group) The Food Groups long-term strategy is to leverage the platform it has developed and to continue to pursue selective acquisitions that align with its vertically integrated model. Although the pace of rapid growth in these sectors of the food industry have slowed due to the economic environment, we believe these sectors are growing approximately 5 to 15% per year and that they remain fragmented with numerous players in North America and internationally. SunOpta Inc. 8 December 31, 2008  10-K Specific strategies of the Food Group in the last several years have included the following. Diversify the range of organic and non-genetically modified (non-GMO) grains-based and fruit-based products that SunOpta markets, including via the acquisition of businesses that are vertically integrated through ingredients and packaged products. Develop value-added natural and organic food ingredient solutions to meet demands of food manufacturers wanting to improve the healthfulness of their products or expand into the natural and organic markets. Expand the Canadian natural and organic produce, grocery and natural health products distribution businesses to maintain its position as the leading coast to coast distributor in Canada. With respect to this strategy, we believe the Distribution Group is important beyond its contribution to earnings because it provides insights into the trends for natural and organic products; provides a service to our ingredient and finished packaged goods customers, providing a one-stop outlet for their products into Canada; and allows identification of potentially new ingredients supply customers and acquisition opportunities that would allow expansion of our vertically integrated model. Expand our ability to source and supply natural and organic products worldwide. Invest in healthy convenience food businesses, which we believe will continue to be a strong area of growth for natural and organic food products. Expand the number of customer private label programs including the soy and rice beverage categories, frozen fruit and fruit beverages, and healthy convenience foods. Develop and expand our operations outside of North America. Major Developments in 2008 and 2009 in the SunOpta Food Group We continue to increase our strength in the natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health products sectors through internal growth and selective acquisitions. Achievements through March 5, 2009 include the following. On March 11, 2008, we entered into an agreement with Colorado Mills LLC (Colorado Mills) of Lamar, Colorado, to build and operate an organic and natural vegetable oil refining facility. The venture operates as Colorado Sun Oil Processing LLC and is owned 50% by SunOpta and 50% by Colorado Mills. The processing facility will be located in Lamar, Colorado, adjacent to Colorado Mills existing crude oil processing facility, and will be capable of refining approximately 35 million pounds annually of natural and organic sunflower, soybean and canola oils. The refining facility is under development and is expected to be operational in late 2009. On April 2, 2008, we acquired the outstanding shares of The Organics Corporation, a global supplier of a wide variety of globally sourced organic food ingredients including frozen and fresh fruits and vegetables, dried fruits, coffee, cocoa, cereals, rice, soy, beans, pulses, seeds, nuts, oils, dairy products, seasonings, and sweeteners. TOCs organic foods sourcing and processing expertise complements ours, and we expect the integration of TOC into our operations will result in efficiencies and cost savings, and will expand our sourcing and processing opportunities around the globe. For TOC, we paid €6,000,000 (U.S. $9,371,000) in cash and currently received €3,000,000 (U.S. - $4,685,000) by way of subordinated debt payable to the former shareholders on March 31, 2010 and issued a promissory note for €1,000,000 (U.S. $1,562,000) bearing interest at 7% and payable March 31, 2010. Additional consideration is payable on March 31, 2010 in the amount of the greater of €8,000,000 (U.S. $12,494,000) or 2.5 multiplied by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. At our option, €2,000,000 (U.S. $3,124,000) of this additional payment can be paid in the equivalent value of SunOpta common stock. The common shares of TOC were pledged to the former shareholders as security pending payment of the promissory note and additional consideration. SunOpta Inc. 9 December 31, 2008  10-K On August 26, 2008, our International Sourcing and Trading Group entered into a series of agreements to expand its global organic supply capabilities, primarily in Central America, and to expand its supply of private label and branded frozen food products. Under the agreements, the International Sourcing and Trading Group acquired a number of existing supplier and customer relationships, and the rights to the Pure Nature Organics(tm) frozen fruit and vegetable registered trademark, and entered into an ongoing brokerage and consulting services agreement. On October 14, 2008, our International Sourcing and Trading Group finalized a joint venture agreement with an Ethiopian-based partner to create Selet Hulling to source and produce organic sesame seeds for international distribution. The International Sourcing and Trading Group has a 35% ownership position in this venture and also has the exclusive rights for international distribution of the finished product. On October 14, 2008, our International Sourcing and Trading Group entered into an agreement to assume control of the organic coffee sourcing and processing assets from Alanheri Produkten BV, expanding its existing organic coffee platform. It is estimated that these assets will further position the Group as a supplier of choice for certified organic fair trade Ethiopian origin coffee. On February 25, 2009, our Grains and Foods Group announced that it expects to commence commissioning of a new soy processing and aseptic packaging operation located in Modesto, California in March 2009 with the facility on schedule for commercial production late in the second quarter of 2009. The Modesto, California facility will produce and package organic aseptic soymilk and other beverages, plus expand the Companys product offering into other alternative beverage and aseptically packaged product categories. The new Modesto facility, when combined with the Companys aseptic packaging facility located in Alexandria, Minnesota, is expected to bring total annual production capacity to approximately 250 to 300 million quarts of soymilk and other beverages per year once fully operational. Additionally, the Grains and Foods Group announced that it has commenced production of an innovative and proprietary organic aseptic soymilk for an international food service restaurant company utilizing the capabilities of the Groups vertically integrated soymilk model. Based on a recently finalized supply agreement, SunOpta will supply organic soymilk for this customers stores in the United States and Canada with full product implementation expected over the first half of 2009. GRAINS AND FOODS GROUP The Grains and Foods Group is headquartered in Hope, Minnesota. The Grains and Foods Group specializes in marketing organic, identity preserved (IP), non-GMO grains, ingredients, packaged goods and processing services with a core focus on soybean, sunflower and corn products. The Grains and Foods Group ensures that it provides its customers with high quality organic, non-GMO and IP specialty grains and seeds, by serving as a growers supplier of seed, purchaser of the growers specialty crops and distributor of IP and organic specialty products. The Grains and Foods Groups seed to table approach allows it to satisfy the specific needs of domestic and foreign food manufacturers and processors by providing products in the varieties and quantities needed in a timely fashion; transporting products to meet customers needs by being able to package in containers, truck, rail or barge; providing product information and technical support during the growing, processing, and marketing phases; and offering complete product service including grading, formulation, processing, quality control and packaging.

The Grains and Foods Group also engages in processing and contract manufacturing services and offers a comprehensive range services including basic grain cleaning, ingredient processing, custom roasting, and retail-ready packaging.

Roasting through a facility offering nitrogen-flushed pillow packs, pouches and bulk packaging. SunOpta Inc. 11 December 31, 2008  10-K CompetitionGrains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group competes with large grain suppliers for customers and competes with other companies active on the international commercial grain procurement market for supply. The Grains and Foods Groups organic specialty grains compete in the smaller niche U.S. commercial organic grains market. Key to competing in these markets is access to transportation, supply and relationships with organic producers. The Grains and Foods Groups aseptic packaged products facility competes with a number of other regional manufacturers and ingredient offerings and competes with a range of suppliers from small local companies through large multi-nationals. Distribution, Marketing, and SalesGrains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group has well established sales and marketing capabilities that have provided a base for its rapid and stable growth. As a leading provider of soy, corn, sunflower and grain-based food ingredients, the group offers a comprehensive range of ingredients and services to the food industry. Distribution channels can vary greatly by product category, but the Grains and Foods Group enjoys a diverse to market strategy in each product category. The Grains and Foods Groups Organic, non-GMO and IP ingredients are sold to manufacturers worldwide. For specialty whole food grain raw materials, approximately 50% of the customer base is international. Food ingredients are sold principally to customers in North America that range from major multinationals to smaller specialty innovative organic food makers. The consumer goods distribution channels include private label and store brands, food service and also SunOpta-controlled brands. This wide array of sales and distribution avenues allows the Grains and Foods Group to maximize sales and margin while mitigating the risk of concentrating business in a single segment of the market. SuppliersGrains and Foods Group We have an extensive established IP, organic soy and corn grower network with approximately 2,500 producers, with many relationships existing for over 25 years, and relationships with approximately 500 sunflower farmers in the Midwest and southern U.S. Because weather conditions and other factors can limit the availability of certain grains in North America, our Grains and Foods group is focused on expanding production and sourcing capabilities to other parts of the world to ensure supply in years when local production is below normal levels. By diversifying supply, we also have the ability to divert available product based on market demand and customer requirements in order to maximize return. INGREDIENTS GROUP The Ingredients Group is headquartered in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and operates from five processing facilities throughout the United States. The Ingredients Group transforms both internally and externally sourced raw materials into value-added food ingredient solutions. The Ingredients Group comprises the previously acquired Northern Food & Dairys Fosston, Minnesota facility, Opta Food Ingredients, Inc., and the Cedar Rapids oat fiber facility purchased in 2005 from General Mills. The Ingredients Group specializes in the technical processing of specialty food ingredients with a focus on non-GMO, natural, functional and organic offerings. The Ingredients Group works closely with customers to identify product formulation, and cost and productivity issues, and develops solutions to these problems based on proprietary, value-added, highly functional food ingredients and ingredient systems that use the Ingredients Groups technical knowledge and manufacturing base. The Ingredients Group is an innovator in the value-added food ingredients market with a technical selling and product applications focus. Based on our internal estimates, the Ingredients Group is the worlds largest supplier of oat fiber to the food industry, one of the largest producers of soy fibers in the United States and the largest producer of organic soy fiber in the United States. The Ingredients Group markets the Canadian Harvest ® Oat Fiber and SunOpta ® Soy Fibers brands of insoluble organic and conventional fiber products, a number of value-added starch-based texturizers, resistant starch and proprietary stabilizer blends under the SunOpta Ingredient Systems tm umbrella, and a number of custom processed ingredients including natural preservatives and sweeteners. SunOpta Inc. 12 December 31, 2008  10-K The Ingredients Group continues to diversify its unique portfolio of products. Products are organized under three main technology platforms: 1) Fibers and Brans, which include Canadian Harvest ® , Oat Fibers and Stabilized Bran products as well as SunOpta Soy Fibers. Canadian Harvest Oat Fibers and SunOpta Soy Fibers are a family of insoluble fiber products derived from oat and soy hulls. They are used commercially to increase yield and enhance texture in ground meat products, to add strength and reduce breakage in products such as taco shells and ice cream cones, and to enhance texture and increase the fiber content of cereals, breads, cookies and crackers. We also offer Canadian Harvest Stabilized Brans derived from oat, wheat and corn, as well as wheat germ. The Stabilized Brans are heat-treated to extend shelf life and ground to meet customer needs for appropriate particle size. The Ingredients Group has increased its fiber offerings over the past few years to include organic and conventional soy fibers. One of the Ingredients Groups unique soy fibers is a protein and fiber rich by-product of soy concentrate manufacturing. This fiber is used to enrich protein and fiber for a variety of foods for human consumption plus animal feed and pet foods. 2) SunOptatm Ingredient Systems, which include OptaGrade®, OptaMist®, Blanvers microcrystalline cellulose and a growing portfolio of value added ingredient systems for the bakery, dairy, and meat industries, proprietary stabilizer and dairy powder blends. SunOpta Ingredient Systems are proprietary blends of texturizing agents and other ingredients that are primarily developed and sold for use in bakery, meat, dairy and soy-based product categories. Several of the ingredient systems contain one of the Ingredients Groups unique and proprietary starch-based texturizers. 3) Custom ingredients and contract manufacturing services. We produce a number of unique functional food ingredients, and offers services to customers, on a contract basis utilizing customers proprietary technologies We believe the Ingredients Group is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of the health conscious natural and organic food markets, with its wide range of fiber, soy and starch based products. Publications from both the American Dietetic Association and a Mayo Clinic Health letter note that fiber consumption is still below recommended levels in the U.S. The Ingredients Groups Canadian Harvest ® line of oat fibers and stabilized brans and SunOpta soy fibers are used in numerous products such as fiber-enriched breads and other baked goods, breakfast cereals and snack bars. These products can be used to increase total dietary fiber content of foods while minimizing negative effects on taste, texture and appearance. The Ingredients Groups oat and insoluble soy fibers enhance overall gastrointestinal health. Oat and soy fibers have become primary ingredients in breads, pastries, muffins, tacos and tortillas as food companies reformulate their products to include fiber-enriched ingredients. Recent innovations have expanded applications of fiber into dairy and meat products. Stabilized oat brans can be used as a source of soluble fiber (ß-glucan) which is beneficial to cardiovascular health. The Ingredients Group food ingredients are used by approximately 300 customers worldwide, including some of the largest U.S. consumer packaged food companies and quick service restaurant chains. In 2008, the Ingredients Group continued to enhance its international sales capabilities by adding distributors and currently has approximately 25 distributors around the world. Many of the Ingredients Group starch-based texturizers and ingredient blends were originally developed for and are used in reduced fat versions of a variety of dairy products such as low fat or fat-free cottage cheese, sour cream, cream cheese, or processed cheeses. As discussed in Taking the Fat Out of Food, a publication of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reducing fat intake by consuming reduced fat versions of these products is an element of a healthier diet. With the increased demand for foods containing soy, the Ingredients Group has developed several ingredient blends for use in organic and conventional soy-based dairy alternatives such as soy yogurt, cream cheese, beverages, and frozen desserts. In addition to helping food manufacturers improve the healthfulness of their food products, the ingredients can be used to improve the overall quality of food products, reduce formulation costs, and meet specific processing requirements. We believe that all of its products are Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) under current FDA regulations (see Regulation  SunOpta Food Group, below). SunOpta Inc. 13 December 31, 2008  10-K Recently, the Ingredients Group expanded its portfolio of functional fibers by entering into a distribution agreement with Polycell Technologies to market and sell Barley Balance beta-glucan concentrate. Barley Balance is the most concentrated source of barley beta-glucan soluble fiber produced by a natural and sustainable process. Barley Balance contains a minimum of 25% beta-glucan and over 35% dietary fiber adding excellent nutritional benefits and functional performance to food and beverage products. SunOpta Ingredients Group launched a line of new products under the Multifiber brand name. This family of products consists of different combinations of soluble and insoluble fiber. Each blend provides the nutritional and functional benefits of both insoluble and soluble dietary fiber while being natural and non-GMO. The primary applications for Multifiber will be baked goods, breads, cereals, nutritional bars, pasta and nutritional supplements. In addition the Ingredients Group launched four new oat fiber products. Canadian Harvest® oat fiber 211 is used for fiber enrichment of whole grain products, primarily breads. Canadian Harvest® oat fiber 320 is used specifically for the fiber enrichment of crunchy cookies and crackers, Canadian Harvest® oat fiber 680 helps reduce breakage in crunchy snacks, and Canadian Harvest® oat fiber 240 is for use in a variety of low moisture baked goods which require high levels of fiber fortification. CompetitionIngredients Group Food ingredients are considered unique niche items usually developed or processed for specific customers or industry segments. The Ingredients Group competes with other product developers and specialty processors for the specialty ingredient business. The food ingredients industry is intensely competitive. Competitors include major companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient and sourcing companies, stabilizer companies and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources as well as production and marketing capabilities that are greater than ours. Distribution, Marketing, and SalesIngredients Group Sales and marketing is done through a technically oriented customer account team. The Ingredients Group believes that the most effective way to solve each customers problem is to gain a thorough understanding of the customer at all levels, build solid working relationships throughout the customers organization, be knowledgeable of the market segment in which the customer competes, and have a detailed technical understanding of the customers need as well as its preferred solution. We take a multidisciplinary approach to achieve this level of customer understanding and service. Members of the Ingredient Groups direct sales force are teamed up with the appropriate technical personnel to work as consultants in defining and developing a range of potential solutions to our customers formulation and product development needs. SuppliersIngredients Group The Ingredients Groups raw materials and packaging are sourced from approximately 1,000 suppliers with availability subject to world market conditions. There are a number of alternative sources of supply for all raw materials with critical supply relationships highlighted below. Dairy ingredients are purchased primarily from dairy producer cooperatives. Products are purchased in the spot market with certain ingredients purchased under short-term supply contracts. Oat and soy hulls are primarily sourced from major food companies or their brokers and there is ample supply to meet production requirements. The supply for these ingredients is sufficient to meet current demand. Supply shortfalls would have an effect on availability and price and would be reflected in finished product pricing for the Ingredients Group. Certain other raw materials are supplied by processing customers and are not sourced directly from Food Group suppliers. FRUIT GROUP The Fruit Group is headquartered in Buena Park, California. The Fruit Group focuses on providing natural and organic fruit and vegetable based products to the private label retail, quick-service restaurant, food service and industrial markets. The Fruit Group comprises two separate operating divisions: SunOpta Inc. 14 December 31, 2008  10-K 1. Fruit Specialties (comprised of Cleughs Frozen Foods Inc., Pacific Fruit Processors Inc., Hess Food Group LLC, Baja California Congelados S.A. de C.V., and Congeladora del Rio S.A. de C.V.), and 2. Healthy Fruit Snacks (comprised of Kettle Valley Dried Fruit, Ltd.). Prior to 2008, the Fruit Group included SunOpta Global Organic Ingredients; however, this operation is now reported in the SunOpta International Sourcing and Trading Group along with recently acquired TOC. We believe the Fruit Group is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of the natural and organic fruit and vegetable market, and to adjust to market pressures resulting from a continued economic downturn due to flexible operations. The Fruit Groups global sourcing and production capabilities, coupled with extensive product development expertise, provide a solid platform for continued future growth. Based on management estimates, the Fruit Group is one of the largest suppliers of organic individually quick-frozen fruit to the private label retail market in the United States. The Fruit Group provides customers with a wide range of products including bulk raw materials and value-added ingredients and quick-service products to casual dining restaurant and retail solutions. The Fruit Group services over 500 customers, including food manufactures, food service distributors, quick-service and casual dining restaurants and retail companies located principally in North America and Asia. The Fruit Group is headquartered in Buena Park, California. The Fruit Groups two divisions operate as follows: 1. Fruit Specialties: This division consists of both berry processing and fruit base operations. The berry processing operations consist of fruit and berry processing facilities with value added processing capabilities, as well as sourcing and trading capabilities within the Hess Food Group, a member of the Fruit Specialties division of the Fruit Group. This division processes strawberries, peaches, mangos and other fruits and vegetables, and packs natural and organic frozen fruits and vegetables for the private label retail, food service, and industrial ingredient markets. The division sources fresh fruits, berries, and vegetables from various growing regions throughout California and Mexico, and processes the fruit into individually quick- frozen, block frozen, strawberry sugar packs and purees to meet the customers technical specifications. The division supplies frozen fruit products to the private label retail, food service and industrial markets, including food manufacturers and quick service and casual dining restaurants. The divisions poly-bag packaging operations in Buena Park, California and Irapuato, Mexico, provide retail customers with a wide range of private label natural and organic frozen fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, peaches, mangos, tropical fruit and many other items. The division operates four berry processing facilities located in Buena Park and Salinas, California, and Rosarito and Irapuato, Mexico. As a result of the general economic environment, the division has temporarily closed its Salinas, California and Rosarito, Mexico facilities. The divisions Pacific Fruit Processors is a member of the Fruit Specialties division of the Fruit Group, and produces a range of value-added fruit bases in aseptic and other packaging for sale to manufacturers and food service operations and restaurants. Fruit Specialties also has sourcing and trading capabilities within the Hess Food Group. Raw materials consist primarily of fresh strawberries sourced from growers in California and Mexico, and fresh peaches, pineapple, mangos, honeydew melons, cantaloupes, and other fruits from growers in Mexico. The operations face competition in securing the grower base required to meet its needs; however, due to the location of its processing facilities, the operations are able to source raw materials from a number of growing regions by securing exclusive supply arrangements and in some cases providing short term crop advances to growers to finance harvesting of upcoming crops. The operations also source other frozen fruits and vegetables from a number of domestic and worldwide growers, processors and traders, including the internal SunOpta International Sourcing and Trading Group. SunOpta Inc. 15 December 31, 2008  10-K 2. Healthy Fruit Snacks: This division produces natural and organic fruit snacks. The division operates processing facilities in Summerland, British Columbia and in Omak, Washington. During 2007 and 2008, the division significantly expanded its operations at Omak by adding capacity for an additional 140 million units per year, doubling through-put. The divisions primary raw material, apple, is sourced from both local growers and internationally through the SunOpta International Sourcing and Trading Group. The divisions production capabilities include a variety of bar, twist, rope and bite sizes and shapes, as well as the ability to add a variety of ingredients including fiber. The division has internal research and development capabilities to introduce innovative products to the marketplace. CompetitionFruit Group The fruit and berry processing operations compete with strawberry processors in California and Mexico and frozen fruit imports from Mexico, South America, Europe and Asia. The competitive landscape includes divisions of companies with financial resources larger than ours. In many cases, Mexican, South American, European and Asian competitors are able to achieve greater cost efficiencies due to lower relative cost of living in these regions. The processing operations in Mexico and California provide a counter seasonal supply for SunOpta customers and opportunity address this competitive factor. The fruit base operations compete with regional and national food manufacturers. In addition, the operations face research and development competition from flavor companies. A number of these competitors have production capabilities and financial resources that are greater than ours. The healthy fruit snack operations faces competition from a small number of competitors, some of whom have production and technical capabilities and financial resources greater than ours. These competitors include independent fruit snack manufacturers and fruit snack divisions of larger food manufacturers. Distribution, Marketing and SalesFruit Group The fruit and berry processing operation supplies frozen fruit products to the private label retail, food service and industrial markets, including food manufacturers and quick service and casual dining restaurants. The fruit base operation supplies natural and organic value-added fruit ingredients to the dairy, food service and beverage industries. The operations offer fruit bases and preps for customers seeking high-quality, custom formulations to meet their flavor and texture profiles. Applications include fruit for yogurts, ice creams, cheeses, smoothies, shakes, frozen desserts, bakery fillings, health bars, various beverages, dressings, marinades, dips and sauces. The fruit base operations research and development team is integral to the operations reputable product quality and customer service. Manufacturing capabilities include aseptic and conventional processing and packaging at its processing facility in South Gate, California. The healthy fruit snack operation focuses on supplying natural and organic fruit snacks to the private label Canadian and U.S. retail markets. SuppliersFruit Group The fruit and berry processing operations source fresh fruits, berries, and vegetables from a large number of growers throughout California and Mexico. The fruit base operations primary raw materials are sourced from processors and traders of frozen fruits and vegetables, including SunOptas International Sourcing and Trading Group and fruit and berry processing operations, major sweetener producers, and a number of regional and national flavor companies. Availability of supplies is subject to world market conditions, including quantity and quality of supply. The healthy fruit snack operations raw material suppliers include growers and traders of apples and flavor companies as well as processors and traders of frozen fruits including SunOptas International Sourcing and Trading Group. This division is subject to the availability of apples based on conditions beyond its control. SunOpta Inc. 16 December 31, 2008  10-K INTERNATIONAL SOURCING AND TRADING GROUP The International Sourcing and Trading Group is headquartered in Aptos, California, and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Our International Sourcing and Trading Group is comprised of SunOpta Global Organic Ingredients (SGOI), previously part of the SunOpta Fruit Group, and TOC, which was acquired in April 2008. The group sources raw material ingredients from approximately 60 countries around the world, and, in managements estimation, is the largest supplier of a wide range of organic commodities to the food industry in the European Union, North American and Asian markets. The group provides organic food solutions to major global food manufacturers and distributors, and major U.S. supermarket chains with a variety of industrial and private label retail products. The group sources or produces organic fruit and vegetable-based ingredients, sweeteners, cocoa, coffee, grains, nuts, seeds and pulses and other organic food products from virtually every continent and in both hemispheres to ensure quality of supply, minimize crop risk and provide contra-seasonal solutions to its customers. In many cases, the group enters into exclusive arrangements with growers and/or processors of key strategic commodities to control the reliability of its supply chain. Utilizing a number of strategic and/or exclusive co-pack relationships and an experienced research and development team, the group provides its retail customers and distributors with organic private label turn-key solutions in a variety of product categories, including juices, frozen fruits and vegetables, specialty beverages and tomato products. CompetitionInternational Sourcing and Trading Group The organic food industry is intensively competitive due primarily to the limited worldwide supply of organic raw materials. Our competitors in the supply of industrial ingredients include domestic and worldwide brokers, traders and food processors. In the private label retail market, competitors include major food manufacturing companies, some of which have production and technical capabilities more extensive ours. Distribution, Marketing and SalesInternational Sourcing and Trading Group The International Sourcing and Trading Group operates administrative, research and development offices in Aptos, California and Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and sales and sourcing offices in Germany, France, Thailand, Ethiopia and the United States. The group also operates a factory in Dalian, China that supplies food grade organic soybeans and feed, organic sunflower kernels and other grains. In addition, the group has a sourcing and processing operation for organic coffee and organic sesame seeds in Ethiopia. The group also provides procurement support for other SunOpta divisions particularly, the Fruit Group. Sales and marketing is done through technically oriented sales teams strategically located close to specific geographic sourcing and sale regions. The group maintains one of the largest global sourcing and supply networks in the world, working closely to manage global organic supply and link these supplies with diverse customer needs. SuppliersInternational Sourcing and Trading Group The International Sourcing and Trading Groups raw material suppliers include growers, processors and traders of organic fruit and vegetable based ingredients, sweeteners and other food products. Raw materials are sourced from worldwide growing regions, including North America, South America, Central America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Organic food suppliers are required to meet stringent organic certification requirements equivalent to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program or European Union standards. SunOpta Inc. 17 December 31, 2008  10-K DISTRIBUTION GROUP The Distribution Group is headquartered in Richmond, British Columbia. The Distribution Group represents the final layer of our vertically integrated organic, natural and specialty food and natural health products business model. We started to build a Canadian national organic, natural, kosher and specialty food distribution system in late 2002 and since then have built what we believe is the largest distribution platform in Canada, serving natural, organic and specialty foods and natural health products and handling approximately 22,000 natural, organic, kosher and specialty food products; and fresh organic produce, vitamins, supplements and other natural health products. The broad range of products includes our branded and private label packaged products. The Distribution Group plans to continue expansion through internal growth and through additional strategic acquisitions. According to The Organic Trade Associations 2007 Manufacturer Survey, the market for Canadian natural food distribution grew by approximately 1015% in 2007 and this growth trend continued for most of 2008 but is expected to slow somewhat in 2009 as a result of weak economic conditions in Canada and around the world. In addition, according to the same survey, the market segment growth, in dollars, continues to be significantly higher than conventional foods and organic penetration continues to increase as consumers continue to recognize the benefits of a healthier lifestyle and environment through a diet that includes natural, organic and quality specialty foods as well as natural vitamins, supplements and health and beauty aids. The Distribution Group is also strategically important to other parts of our food business. The Distribution Groups major products are as follows: Fresh Organic Produce  a full line of certified organic fruits, vegetables and bulk foods. Fresh Organic Dairy and Dairy Alternatives  numerous regional and national brands of organic liquid milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, tofu, soy cheese, soy beverages and other dairy alternatives. Bulk Foods  a full range of organic bulk foods including grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, legumes, flours and healthy snacks. Natural and Organic Grocery  approximately 8,000 natural and organic grocery items including dry, refrigerated and frozen categories from a broad range of North American and international suppliers. Kosher and Specialty Foods Grocery  approximately 6,000 kosher and specialty groceries including dry and refrigerated product offerings. Natural Health Products  approximately 7,000 branded and/or distributed SKUs of natural vitamins, supplements and health and beauty aids, many of which are formulated, processed and packaged within the Groups vertically integrated manufacturing operations and sold under company brands such as Herbon, Vivitas, Natures Harmony and Quest. CompetitionDistribution Group The Distribution Group competes against much larger conventional distributors; however, management believes that SunOpta is the largest national natural and organic foods and natural health products distributor in Canada. Competition in organic and natural grocery products is represented by a number of regional natural and organic food distributors that vary greatly in size. Management believes that Purity Life, a member of the Distribution Group, is Canadas largest distributor of natural health products. Purity Life competes with a handful of national distributors and a diverse group of much smaller regional distributors. Distribution, Marketing and SalesDistribution Group The Distribution Groups primary direct-to-store distribution coverage includes central, eastern and western Canada. We primarily service independent natural and organic food retailers and supermarket chains. The customer mix also includes a growing component of large mass merchandisers and major drugstore chains. The Distribution Groups core competencies include direct-to-store service, the breadth of its product line, and organic market and natural health product knowledge. SunOpta Inc. 18 December 31, 2008  10-K SuppliersDistribution Group The Distribution Group sources products from over 900 suppliers around the world. Overall supply is sufficient; however, quality, price and availability of fresh produce can be affected by harsh weather conditions in growing regions. With respect to fresh produce items, supply is controlled through spot pricing, with changes in supply reflected in prices to end customers. Regulation  SunOpta Food Group The SunOpta Food Group is affected by a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various countries and regions where it operates, including the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, and the European Union. These laws, regulations and policies are implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial and local levels. Examples of laws and regulations that affect the Food Group include laws and regulations applicable to the use of seed, fertilizer and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and warehousing of grain and other products; the processing and sale of food, including wholesale operations; and the labelling and marketing of food and food products. Additionally, government-sponsored price supports and acreage set aside programs are two examples of policies that may also have an impact on the Food Group. In addition, the Food Groups business activities are subject to a number of environmental regulations. The Food Group is involved in the sourcing, manufacturing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic seed and food products and, as such, is subject to certain organic quality assurance standards. The Food Group is currently in compliance with all state and federal fertilizer, pesticide, food processing, grain buying and warehousing, and wholesale food-handling regulations. Regulatory agencies include the USDA, which monitors both the organic process and agricultural grain business; the FDA, which oversees the safety, security and efficacy of the food supply in the United States; the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) which monitors food processing and safety in Canada; and SKAL, an organization that certifies organic products in the Netherlands. Certain food ingredients are regulated under the 1958 Food Additive Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 as administered by the FDA. Pre-marketing approval by the FDA is required for the sale of a food additive unless we believe the substance is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) under FDA standards. A food additive is a substance, the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, either in their becoming a component of food or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food. Such pre-marketing approval for ingredients that are not GRAS, which is issued in the form of formal regulation, requires a showing both that the food ingredient is safe under its intended conditions of use and that it achieves the function for which it is intended. Companies may establish GRAS status through self-affirmation in which the producer determines on its own that the ingredient is GRAS, normally with the assistance of a panel of qualified experts. The producer may also voluntarily submit a GRAS Notification to the FDA that includes the products description, conditions of use, and the basis for GRAS determination among other information. The FDA response, typically within 180 days, to a GRAS notice is not an approval and the product may be marketed while the FDA is reviewing the information. A food ingredient is eligible for GRAS classification based on the views of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of the product. The experts views are either based on scientific procedures or through experience based on common use of the material prior to 1958. If based on scientific procedures they must use the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as would be required for the FDA to issue a pre-market approval of the sale of a food additive. If a food ingredient is not entitled to GRAS status, pre-market approval must be sought through the filing of a Food Additive Petition. Many of the Food Groups products are being marketed pursuant to GRAS self-affirmation. The Food Group believes that a majority of products for which it has retained commercial rights are GRAS. However, such status cannot be determined until actual formulations and uses are finalized. Thereafter, the Food Group decides whether self-affirmation procedures and a GRAS notification will be appropriate. For those components that do not qualify for GRAS, we may be required to file a Food Additive Petition. In the event that a petition is required, we may elect to sell or license its rights to manufacture, market, and distribute the component to another party. SunOpta Inc. 19 December 31, 2008  10-K Countries other than the U.S. also regulate the sale of food ingredients or characterize food ingredients differently. Vitamin and minerals supplements in the U.S. are regulated pursuant to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which regulates these products as foods. In Canada these products are presently regulated as drugs. Regulations vary substantially from country to country, and we take appropriate steps to comply with such regulations. In Canada, we have sales of Natural Health Products (NHPs"), drugs, cosmetic, devices and pest control products. These may be regulated by various federal, provincial and municipal laws, but are principally regulated by the Canadian federal government pursuant to Canadas Food and Drugs Act and supporting regulations, the Pest Control Products Act and supporting regulations and the Canada Environmental Protection Act, 1999, (CEPA) and supporting regulations. A substantial portion of these products, are classed in Canada as NHPs and are regulated pursuant to the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act and the Natural Health Product Regulations (NHP Regulations), enacted under Canadas Food and Drugs Act. As this regulatory framework is still considered to be relatively new, (it became effective January 1, 2004), Health Canada has published a compliance policy and guide which have the practical effect of relaxing enforcement of the NHP Regulations, assisting regulated parties in complying with the NHP Regulations. Prior to the adoption of the NHP Regulations, many of the NHPs now regulated under the NHP Regulations were regulated as drugs pursuant to the Food and Drug Regulations. These products will continue to be classed as drugs pending their transition to the NHP regulatory framework, which for those products which bear a DIN is not required until December 31, 2009. Full compliance with the NHP Regulations including those presently marketed as drugs will likely be required by April 1, 2010 based on verbal representations made by the NHP Directorate to industry representatives. This extension of the compliance policy and guide is and likely will be dependent on the ability of the Natural Health Products Directorates ability to reduce the existing backlog to workload, i.e. reducing the time frame from submission to review of a pre-market application from the existing time frame to a time frame considered to be representative of performance criteria to be established for future operations of the NHPD. As such, our compliance with the NHP Regulations will at that point become mandatory, and any NHPs for which a market authorization has not been granted will have to be removed from the marketplace until the market authorization is issued. Failure to do so could see enforcement action taken by the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate, which could include the removal of non-compliant NHPs from the market place and possibly result in charges against us. In addition to the NHPs and drugs which we sell, we also import and sell cosmetic products for which we file with Health Canada, cosmetic notification forms, a post-marketing requirement for those cosmetics manufactured in Canada and a pre-market requirement for those products imported into Canada. In light of the changes to the Cosmetic Regulations requiring ingredient disclosure on the cosmetic product labeling, we continue to work with its vendors to bring cosmetic labeling into compliance. In addition, there is an ongoing review of ingredients used in regulated products, including those we sell, for compliance with CEPA. The Canadian Federal Government has undertaken a review of ingredients used in commerce for these regulated products with a view of determining whether the use of certain ingredients in these products represent a risk to the environment. This could eventually lead to the removal of the use of these ingredients in Canada. This would require a re-formulation of product affected by such a determination. On April 8, 2008, the Federal Government introduced two proposed pieces of legislation intended to overhaul the Food and Product Safety Laws in Canada. Bill C-51, legislation to amend the Food and Drugs Act, and Bill C-52, the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, Bill C-51 and C-52 propose amendments to the Food and Drugs Act as well as a new Canada Consumer Product Safety Act. The changes include: Greater oversight of manufacturers, importers and retailers, including requiring holders of market authorizations to provide information and/or conduct tests to establish the benefits and risks associated with the sale of the product, lead to: Increased public access to risk and benefits associated with products. Ability to disclose personal and confidential business information. SunOpta Inc. 20 December 31, 2008  10-K A general prohibition against the manufacture, importation, advertisement or sale of consumer products that are a danger to human health or safety. A requirement of mandatory reporting by suppliers of serious product-related incidents including near- misses and defects, allowing for more targeted oversight. Substantially increased fines for violations, including imposing on directors and officers liability for the breaches committed by the corporate bodies. The power to order recalls of unsafe products, increased powers for inspectors, direct persons in control of consumer products to take actions or refrain from taking certain actions. These two pieces of proposed legislation are not yet law in Canada; it is expected that there will be amendments proposed to be made to the bills once a committee of the Federal Parliament reviews the proposed bills and hears comments from stakeholders affected by these bills. The Food Group endeavours to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental regulations. Some of the key regulations in the U.S. include: Air Quality  air quality is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and certain city/state air pollution control groups. Emission reports are filed annually. Waste Treatment/Disposal  solid waste is either disposed of by a third-party or, in some cases, we have a permit to haul and land apply. Agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and other constituents. This can require weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. Sewer  agreements with the local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified limits of BOD and TSS. This requires weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. Hazardous Chemicals  various reports are filed with local city/state emergency response agencies to identify potential hazardous chemicals being used in our facilities. Storm Water  all facilities are inspected annually and must comply with an approved storm water plan to protect water supplies. Bioterrorism Compliance  we are currently complying with the four recognized and approved sections of the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. In Canada, the key regulatory framework is found in the regulations to the CEPA. Prior to the importation and use in products, the importer must ensure that all ingredients are found on the Domestic Substances List (DSL) maintained by Environment Canada. In the event that an ingredient is not found on the DSL, then subject to the amount of the substance imported into Canada and used in products sold in Canada, a filing may become necessary under the New Substances Notification Regulations. All of the Food Groups Canadian manufacturing facilities and warehouses are registered with the CFIA and/or Health Canada. All imported materials are shipped in compliance with the notification systems that alert FDA, Health Canada, the CFIA and customs before the materials enter the country. We have the necessary processes and controls in place that provide for an additional level of traceability of all raw materials from the supplier to the immediate subsequent recipient of the finished products. We also recognize and have the necessary programs that allow the applicable regulatory body the right to seize, voluntarily retain and or recall any regulated product if required by law and if the regulatory body has credible evidence that the sale of the product and its use may be a threat to the health and well-being of the intended recipient. As a result of the 2008 acquisition of TOC with its headquarters in the Netherlands, we are now subject to Dutch and European Commission (EC) regulations and policies. TOC is involved in the sourcing, supplying, marketing, selling and distribution of organic food products and, as such, is subject to standards for production, labeling and inspection of organic products contained in EC Regulation 2092/91 (and its subsequent amendments). TOC is certified by SKAL, the inspection body for the production of organic products in the Netherlands. Products certified as organic by a European Union (EU) recognized inspection body, such as SKAL, can be marketed within the entire EU. SunOpta Inc. 21 December 31, 2008  10-K TOC is also affected by general food legislation both at an EU and Dutch level relating to product safety and hygiene, among others. TOC is Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) certified in the Netherlands and manages a fully computerized system that guarantees the traceability of each product. In addition, TOC also considers and abides by EC and local legislation with regard to packaging and packaging waste. Research and Development  SunOpta Food Group The Food Group maintains extensive applications and research and development expertise via resources which are organized around four key product categories: Grains and grain-based ingredients through finished packaged products; Value-added ingredients focused on fiber and starch-based applications; Fruits and fruit-based ingredients through finished packaged products; and Natural health products sold via certain owned brands within Purity Life and other units within the Distribution Group These groups maintain staffs of highly trained and experienced food scientists and engineers dedicated to resolving customer formulation, processing and packaging challenges. Applications and technical support provided by each of the groups to its customers include all aspects of product development from concept to commercial launch as well as ongoing manufacturing and processing support. Ongoing research and development is a key priority of the Food Group. Research and development initiatives are intended to continually improve existing product portfolios in addition to bringing new and innovative products to the market, a key requirement in the fast growing natural and organic foods and health categories. The Food Group has continued to develop a number of new soy and other grain-based ingredients and alternatives to accommodate new product adaptation of these ingredients into various food items. The expanding interest to incorporate soy and grain-based foods in consumers diets creates numerous opportunities to develop ingredients that can be incorporated into food developers menu items. In addition, the Food Group continues to expand its product portfolio via the addition of new fiber offerings and other texturizing agents that can be used along with its oat-derived ingredients to improve the nutritional content of a variety of foods. Many of these ingredients can be used in products that help address the industrys need to respond to the growing epidemic of obesity in North America and elsewhere by replacing fat, sugars and other calorie-dense components of food. These ingredients can also be used in products which qualify for a whole grain claim by augmenting the insoluble and soluble fiber content of foods. In hand with continued focus on increasing consumption of fruit-based products in North America, the Food Group has developed a number of new fruit-based beverage, fruit snack and other packaged goods applications and continues in the development of innovative fruit ingredient systems for the dairy, food service and beverage industries. Intellectual Property  SunOpta Food Group The nature of a number of the Food Groups products and processes requires that we create and maintain patents and trade secrets. The Food Groups policy is to protect its technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of its business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions. The Food Groups success will depend, in part, on its ability to protect its products and technology under U.S. and international patent laws and other intellectual property laws. We believe that we own or have the right to use all proprietary technology necessary to manufacture and market our products; however, there is always a risk that patent applications relating to our products or technologies will not result in patents being issued or that current or additional patents will not afford protection against competitors with similar technology. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain technologies and processes. Even with the steps taken, our outside partners and contract manufacturers could gain access to our proprietary technology and confidential information. All employees are required to adhere to internal policies which are intended to further protect the Food Groups technologies, processes and trade secrets. SunOpta Inc. 22 December 31, 2008  10-K Employees  SunOpta Food Group The Food Group has approximately 2,126 full-time employees as of December 31, 2008. Aside from unions at the Fruit Groups Mexican facilities and the International Sourcing and Trading Groups China facility, there are no other unions within the Food Group. Properties  SunOpta Food Group The Food Group operates from 26 processing facilities (16 owned, 10 leased) in eleven U.S. states, two Canadian provinces, Mexico, China and Ethiopia. The Food Group also owns and leases a number of office and distribution locations and also leases and utilizes public warehouses to satisfy its storage needs. For more details see
