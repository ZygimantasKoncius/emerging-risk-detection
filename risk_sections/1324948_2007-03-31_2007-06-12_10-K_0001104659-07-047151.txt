ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Cautionary Statement As To Forward-Looking Information This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including any projections of earnings, cash flows, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; future growth rates in the markets we serve; increases in foreign sales; supply and cost of raw materials, any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements may include the words may, estimate, intend, continue, believe, expect, anticipate, the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties, such as those disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: · Weaknesses and cyclicality in any of the industries in which our customers operate; · Changes in marketing, product pricing and sales strategies or developments of new products by us or our competitors; · Future reductions in U.S. governmental spending or changes in governmental programs, particularly military equipment procurement programs; · Suspension or debarment from acting as a government supplier; · Our ability to obtain and retain product approvals; · Supply and costs of raw materials, particularly steel, and energy resources and our ability to pass through these costs on a timely basis; · Our ability to address technological advances in metallurgy or in material advances and introduce new products to remain competitive; · Our ability to acquire and integrate complementary businesses; · Unexpected equipment failures, catastrophic events or capacity constraints; · Development of new litigation; · Our ability to attract and retain our management team and other highly-skilled personnel; · Increases in interest rates; · Work stoppages and other labor problems for us and our customers or suppliers; · Contractual limitations on our ability to expand our business; · Regulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries; · Developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights; · Actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, fluctuations in our operating results or the failure to meet the expectations of financial market analysts and investors; · Changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles; · Risks associated with operating internationally, including currency translation risks; · The operating and stock performance of comparable companies; · Acts of terrorism or major catastrophic events; · Investors perceptions of us and our industry; and · General economic, geopolitical, industry and market conditions. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7. Managements 7 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We are not under any duty to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. All forward-looking statements contained in this report and any subsequently filed reports are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should carefully consider these risks before investing in shares of our common stock. Risk Factors Related to Our Company The bearing industry is highly competitive, and this competition could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to grow. The global bearing industry is highly competitive, and we compete with many U.S. and non-U.S. companies, some of which benefit from lower labor costs and fewer regulatory burdens than us. We compete primarily based on product qualifications, product line breadth, service and price. Certain competitors are larger than us or subsidiaries of larger entities and may be better able to manage costs than us or may have greater financial resources than we have. Due to the competitiveness in the bearing industry we may not be able to increase prices for our products to cover increases in our costs, or we may face pressure to reduce prices, which could materially reduce our revenues, gross margin and profitability. Competitive factors, including changes in market penetration, increased price competition and the introduction of new products and technology by existing and new competitors could result in a material reduction in our revenues and profitability. The loss of a major customer could result in a material reduction in our revenues and profitability. Our top ten customers generated 32% of our net sales during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Accordingly, the loss of one or more of those customers or a substantial decrease in such customers purchases from us could result in a material reduction in our revenues and profitability. In addition, the consolidation and combination of defense or other manufacturers may eliminate customers from the industry and/or put downward pricing pressures on sales of component parts. For example, the consolidation that has occurred in the defense industry in recent years has significantly reduced the overall number of defense contractors in the industry. In addition, if one of our customers is acquired or merged with another entity, the new entity may discontinue using us as a supplier because of an existing business relationship with the acquiring company or because it may be more efficient to consolidate certain suppliers within the newly formed enterprise. The significance of the impact that such consolidation may have on our business is difficult to predict because we do not know when or if one or more of our customers will engage in merger or acquisition activity. However, if such activity involved our material customers it could materially impact our revenues and profitability. Weakness in any of the industries in which our customers operate, as well as the cyclical nature of our customers businesses generally, could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. The commercial aerospace, mining and construction equipment and other diversified industrial industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. Margins in those industries are highly sensitive to demand cycles, and our customers in those industries historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production, general economic conditions and business confidence levels. Downward economic cycles have affected our customers and reduced sales of our products resulting in reductions in our revenues and net earnings. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industries could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. For example, the severe downturn in 2001 in the aerospace industry resulted in deferrals or cancellations in aircraft orders, which reduced the volume and price of orders placed for products used to manufacture commercial aircraft, including our bearings and other individual parts and components we manufacture. Previous industry downturns have negatively affected, and future industry downturns may negatively affect, our net sales, gross margin and net income. 8 Future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending could negatively affect our business. In fiscal 2007, 6.5% of our net sales were made directly, and we estimate that approximately an additional 15.6% of our net sales were made indirectly, to the U.S. government to support military or other government projects. Our failure to obtain new government contracts, the cancellation of government contracts or reductions in federal budget appropriations regarding our products could result in materially reduced revenue. In addition, the funding of defense programs also competes with non-defense spending of the U.S. government. Our business is sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and the U.S. government budget. A shift in government defense spending to other programs in which we are not involved or a reduction in U.S. government defense spending generally could materially reduce our revenues, cash flow from operations and profitability. If we, or our prime contractors for which we are a subcontractor, fail to win any particular bid, or we are unable to replace lost business as a result of a cancellation, expiration or completion of a contract, our revenues or cash flow could be reduced. Fluctuating supply and costs of raw materials and energy resources could materially reduce our revenues, cash flow from operations and profitability. Our business is dependent on the availability and costs of energy resources and raw materials, particularly steel, generally in the form of stainless and chrome steel, which are commodity steel products. The availability and prices of raw materials and energy sources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels. Although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain raw materials. Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices in order to obtain these raw materials or energy resources from other sources, which could thereby affect our net sales and profitability. For example, we purchase steel at market prices, which during the past three years have increased to historical highs as a result of a relatively low level of supply and a relatively high level of demand. As a result, we are currently being assessed surcharges on certain of our purchases of steel, and under certain circumstances, we have experienced difficulty in identifying steel for purchase. If we are unable to purchase steel for our operations for a significant period of time, our operations would be disrupted, which could reduce or delay sales of our products, and, in turn, could result in a material reduction in our revenues, cash flow from operations and profitability. In addition, we may be unable to pass on the increased costs of raw materials to our customers, which could materially reduce our cash flow from operations and profitability. We seek to pass through a significant portion of our additional costs to our customers through steel surcharges or price increases. However, even if we are able to pass these steel surcharges or price increases to our customers, there may be a time lag of up to 3 months or more between the time a cost increase goes into effect and our ability to implement surcharges or price increases, particularly for orders already in our backlog. As a result our gross margin percentage may decline, and we may not be able to implement other price increases for our products. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to pass these additional costs on to our customers at all or on a timely basis or that our customers will not seek alternative sources of supply if there are significant or prolonged increases in the price of steel or other raw materials or energy resources. We may not be able to address technological advances or maintain customer relationships which are necessary to remain competitive within our businesses. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, manufacturing expertise, operational flexibility and customer service. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet our customers changing specifications with respect to these criteria. We must remain committed to product research and development, advanced manufacturing techniques and service to remain competitive. We may not be able to address technological advances in metallurgy or in materials science or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive within our businesses, or our competitors may develop products superior to our products. Furthermore, we may be unable to adequately protect any of our own technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. 9 Our products are subject to certain approvals, and the loss of such approvals could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. Essential to servicing the aerospace market is the ability to obtain product approvals. We have a substantial number of product approvals, which enable us to provide products used in virtually all domestic aircraft platforms presently in production or operation. Product approvals are typically issued by the FAA to designated OEMs who are Production Approval Holders of FAA approved aircraft. These Production Approval Holders provide quality control oversight and generally limit the number of suppliers directly servicing the commercial aerospace aftermarket. Regulations enacted by the FAA provide for an independent process (the PMA process), which enables suppliers who currently sell their products to the Production Approval Holders, to sell products to the aftermarket. Our foreign sales may be subject to similar approvals or U.S. export control restrictions. Although we have not lost any material product approvals in the past, we cannot assure you that we will not lose approvals for our products in the future. The loss of product approvals could result in lost sales and materially reduce our revenues and profitability. Under certain circumstances, the U.S. government has the right to debar or suspend us from acting as a U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, and if we are suspended or debarred from acting as a government supplier for any reason, such an action would materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In connection with our performance of certain U.S. government contracts, the federal government audits and reviews our performance, pricing practices and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. It is possible that as a result of these audits, our revenues, cash flow or results of operations could be materially reduced as a result of lost sales or penalties. For example, the government could disallow certain costs that it originally reimbursed, and we may be required to refund cash already collected. It is also possible that a government audit, review or investigation could uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to civil, criminal and/or administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to, termination of contracts, reimbursement of payments received, fines, forfeiture of profits and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies. If any allegations of impropriety were made against us, whether or not true, our reputation could be adversely affected. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government, or any specific agency, if our reputation was impaired or if the government ceased or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our revenues and cash flow could be reduced. As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to various federal laws, regulations and standards. New laws, regulations or standards or changes to existing laws, regulations or standards could subject us to additional costs of compliance or liabilities and could result in material reductions to our results of operations, cash flow or revenues. We have outstanding debt, and may incur additional debt in the future for acquisitions or other purposes, which could materially impact our business. As of March 31, 2007, we had total indebtedness of $59.4 million. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future for acquisitions and other purposes, and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have effects on our operations, including: · limit our ability to obtain additional financing to operate our business; · require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt, reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general operational requirements; · limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business or industry; · place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to some of our competitors that have less debt than us; and · increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy. The occurrence of any one of these events could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow our business. Restrictions in our indebtedness agreements could limit our growth and our ability to respond to changing conditions. 10 The KeyBank Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to: · incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock and guarantee indebtedness; · create liens on our assets; · pay dividends or make other equity distributions; · purchase or redeem capital stock; · create restrictions on payments of dividends or other amounts to us by our restricted subsidiaries; · make investments; · merge, consolidate or sell assets; · engage in activities unrelated to our current business; · engage in transactions with our affiliates; and · sell or issue capital stock of certain subsidiaries. In addition, the KeyBank Credit Agreement contains other financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum senior leverage ratios and to satisfy certain other financial conditions. Our KeyBank Credit Agreement prohibits us from incurring capital expenditures of more than $20 million per year. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. As of March 31, 2007, we had $42.0 million outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $21.4 million under our $150.0 million KeyBank Credit Agreement. Under the KeyBank Credit Agreement, we had borrowing availability of $86.6 million as of March 31, 2007. Work stoppages and other labor problems could materially reduce our ability to operate our business. As of March 31, 2007, approximately 15% of our hourly employees were represented by labor unions in the U.S. While we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory, a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our facilities, particularly at some of our larger facilities, could materially reduce our ability to operate our business. In addition, any attempt by our employees not currently represented by a union to join a union could result in additional expenses, including with respect to wages, benefits and pension obligations. We currently have three collective bargaining agreements, one agreement covering approximately 70 employees will expire in June 2009, one agreement covering approximately 32 employees will expire in October 2009, and one agreement covering approximately 82 employees will expire in January 2008. Negotiations for the extension of these agreements may result in modifications to the terms of these agreements, and these modifications could cause us to incur increased costs relating to our labor force. In addition, work stoppages at one or more of our customers or suppliers, including suppliers of transportation services, many of which have large unionized workforces, for labor or other reasons could also cause disruptions to our business that we cannot control, and these disruptions may materially reduce our revenues and profitability. Our business is capital intensive and may consume cash in excess of cash flow from our operations. Our ability to remain competitive, sustain our growth and expand our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and our access to capital. We intend to fund our cash needs through operating cash flow and borrowings under our KeyBank Credit Agreement. We may require additional equity or debt financing to fund our growth and debt repayment obligations. In addition, we may need additional capital to fund future acquisitions. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to pay our debt obligations and capital expenditures or 11 we may not be able to refinance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity. Unexpected equipment failures, catastrophic events or capacity constraints may increase our costs and reduce our sales due to production curtailments or shutdowns. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment, such as furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers, and this equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, earthquakes or violent weather conditions. In the future, we may experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of these types of equipment failures or catastrophes. Interruptions in production capabilities will inevitably increase our production costs and reduce sales and earnings for the affected period. Certain of our facilities are operating at a single shift with light second and third shifts, and additional demand may require additional shifts and/or capital investments at these facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to add additional shifts as needed in a timely way and production constraints may result in lost sales. In certain markets we refrain from making additional capital investments to expand capacity where we believe market expansion in a particular end market is not sustainable or otherwise does not justify the expansion or capital investment. Our assumptions and forecasts regarding market conditions in these end markets may be erroneous and may result in lost earnings, potential sales going to competitors and inhibit our growth. The occurrence of extraordinary events, such as a major terrorist attack, may adversely affect our business, resulting in a decrease in our revenues. Future terrorist attacks cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economy of the U.S. and other countries in which we do business. Such attacks may have a material impact on the markets in which we operate, particularly commercial aerospace, as increased terrorist activity around the world is likely to cause a reduction in air travel. For example, in the period following September 11, 2001, aircraft orders declined significantly and materially reduced our sales to the aerospace market. Similar effects are likely to result if there is a significant increase in terrorist activity around the world, particularly if commercial airliners are again involved in one or more major terrorist incidents. Other kinds of significant terror incidents may also impair our ability to conduct our manufacturing and other business activities for extended periods depending on the nature and severity of the event. We may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for us to realize our growth strategy. The acquisition of businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy. We frequently engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and negotiations for possible acquisitions, some of which, if consummated, could be significant to us. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms in the future for a number of different reasons including the increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs, and consolidation in our industries reducing the number of acquisition targets. Our inability to acquire businesses, or to operate them profitably once acquired, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, cash flow and growth. The costs and difficulties of integrating acquired businesses could impede our future growth. We cannot assure you that any future acquisition will enhance our financial performance. Our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on, among other things, the culture of the acquired business matching with our culture, the ability to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business, the ability to retain customers and integrate customer bases, the adequacy of our implementation plans, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies and sales goals. The integration of any acquired businesses might cause us to incur unforeseen costs, which would lower our future earnings and would prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions. Even if we are able to integrate future acquired businesses with our operations successfully, we cannot assure you that we will realize all of the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that we anticipate from such integration or that we will realize such benefits within the expected time frame. As a result of our acquisitions of other businesses, we may be subject to the risk of unforeseen business uncertainties or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers may not 12 indemnify us, or be financially able to indemnify us. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of securities. We depend heavily on our senior management and other key personnel, the loss of whom could materially affect our financial performance and prospects. Our business is managed by a small number of key executive officers, including Dr. Michael J. Hartnett. Our future success will depend on, among other things, our ability to keep the services of these executives and to hire other highly qualified employees at all levels. Dr. Hartnett is the only member of our senior management team with a long-term employment contract. The remainder of our key executives are at-will employees. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining executives and other skilled employees that we need. Our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, market and develop our products and serve our customers could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or executives. Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in such activities. We have established operations in certain countries outside the U.S., including Mexico, France, Switzerland and England. Of our 19 facilities, 5 are located outside the U.S., including 3 manufacturing facilities. Approximately 24% of our net sales were derived from sales directly or indirectly outside the U.S. for fiscal 2007. We expect that this proportion is likely to increase as we seek to increase our penetration of foreign markets, including through acquisitions, particularly within the aerospace and defense markets. Our foreign operations are subject to the risks inherent in such activities such as: currency devaluations, logistical and communications challenges, costs of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, greater difficulties in protecting and maintaining our rights to intellectual property, difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations, acts of terrorism or war or other acts that may cause social disruption which are difficult to quantify or predict and general economic conditions in these foreign markets. We are not aware of any proposed material regulatory changes, but our international operations may be negatively impacted by changes in government policies, such as changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof), restrictions on imports and exports, sources of supply, duties or tariffs, the introduction of measures to control inflation and changes in the rate or method of taxation. To date we have not experienced significant difficulties with the foregoing risks associated with our international operations, however, as the size of our international operations has continued to grow, we expect these risks to become increasingly important to our business operations. Currency translation risks may have a material impact on our results of operations. Our Swiss operations utilize the Swiss franc as the functional currency and our French operations utilize the Euro as the functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings. Foreign currency transaction exposure arises primarily from the transfer of foreign currency from one subsidiary to another within the group and to foreign currency denominated trade receivables. Unrealized currency translation gains and losses are recognized upon translation of the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets to U.S. dollars. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our earnings. While we monitor exchange rates, we currently do not have exchange rate hedges in place to reduce the risk of an adverse currency exchange movement. Although currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial performance in the past, such fluctuations may affect our financial performance in the future. The impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskForeign Currency Exchange Rates. Our pension plans are underfunded, and we may be required to make significant future contributions to the plans. As of March 31, 2007, we maintained four noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. The plans were underfunded by $1.1 million in the aggregate as of March 31, 2007 and $3.8 million as of April 1, 2006, which is the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the sum of the fair market value of plans assets. We are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by employee benefit laws and tax laws. The amount of any such required contributions is determined based on annual actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans actuaries. The amount of future contributions will depend upon asset returns, then-current discount rates and a number of other factors, and, as a result, the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly. Additionally, there is a risk that if the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 13 concludes that its risk with respect to our pension plans may increase unreasonably if the plans continue to operate, if we are unable to satisfy the minimum funding requirement for the plans or if the plans become unable to pay benefits, then the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could terminate the plans and take control of their assets. In such event, we may be required to make an immediate payment to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of all or a substantial portion of the underfunding as calculated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation based upon its own assumptions. The underfunding calculated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could be substantially greater than the underfunding we have calculated because, for example, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation may use a significantly lower discount rate. If such payment is not made, then the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could place liens on a material portion of our assets and the assets of any members of our controlled group. Such action could result in a material increase in our pension related expenses and a corresponding reduction in our cash flow and net income. For additional information concerning our pension plans and plan liabilities, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. We may incur material losses for product liability and recall related claims. We are subject to a risk of product and recall related liability in the event that the failure, use or misuse of any of our products results in personal injury, death, or property damage or our products do not conform to our customers specifications. In particular, our products are installed in a number of types of vehicle fleets, including airplanes, trains, automobiles, heavy trucks and farm equipment, many of which are subject to government ordered as well as voluntary recalls by the manufacturer. If one of our products is found to be defective, causes a fleet to be disabled or otherwise results in a product recall, significant claims may be brought against us. Although we have not had any material product liability or recall related claims made against us, and we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage for product liability, although not for recall related claims, we cannot assure you that product liability or recall related claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or would be covered by insurance which, in turn, may result in material losses related to these claims, increased future insurance costs and a corresponding reduction in our cash flow and net income. Environmental regulations impose substantial costs and limitations on our operations, and environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect. We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the storage, handling and disposal of wastes and the health and safety of employees. These laws and regulations could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including compliance costs, civil and criminal fines imposed for failure to comply with these laws and regulatory and litigation costs. We also may be liable under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or similar state laws, for the costs of investigation and clean-up of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other facilities at which we have disposed of hazardous substances. In connection with such contamination, we may also be liable for natural resource damages, government penalties and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage. Compliance with these laws and regulations may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate. New laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could cause a material increase in our environmental related compliance costs and a corresponding reduction in our cash flow and net income. Investigation and remediation of contamination at some of our sites is ongoing. Actual costs to clean-up these sites may exceed our current estimates. Although we have indemnities for certain pre-closing environmental liabilities from the prior owners in connection with our acquisition of several of our facilities, we cannot assure you that the indemnities will be adequate to cover known or newly discovered pre-closing liabilities. Our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business and results of operations; in addition, we may be subject to infringement claims by third parties. Our ability to compete effectively is dependent upon our ability to protect and preserve the intellectual property and other proprietary rights and materials owned, licensed or otherwise used by us. We have numerous U.S. and foreign patents, trademark registrations and U.S. copyright registrations. Our issued patents are expected to expire by their own terms at various dates and most such patents will not expire for at least 5 years. We also have U.S. and foreign trademark and patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that our pending trademark and patent applications will result in trademark registrations and issued patents, and our failure to secure rights under these applications may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover. Although we have attempted to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights both in the United States and in foreign countries through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection and non-disclosure agreements, these steps may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, particularly in foreign countries where the protection available for such intellectual property and other proprietary rights may be limited. To date we are not currently engaged in and have not had any 14 material infringement or other claims pertaining to our intellectual property brought against us in recent years. We cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights will not be infringed upon or that our trade secrets will not be misappropriated or otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. We may not have adequate remedies available for any such infringement or other unauthorized use. We cannot assure you that any infringement claims asserted by us will not result in our intellectual property being challenged or invalidated, that our intellectual property will be held to be of adequate scope to protect our business or that we will be able to deter current and former employees, contractors or other parties from breaching confidentiality obligations and misappropriating trade secrets. In addition, we may become subject to claims against us which could require us to pay damages or limit our ability to use certain intellectual property and other proprietary rights found to be in violation of a third partys rights, and, in the event such litigation is successful, we may be unable to use such intellectual property and other proprietary rights at all or on reasonable terms. Regardless of its outcome, any litigation, whether commenced by us or third parties, could be protracted and costly and could result in increased litigation related expenses, the loss of intellectual property rights or payment of money or other damages, which may result in lost sales and reduced cash flow and decrease our net income. See BusinessIntellectual Property. Cancellation of orders in our backlog of orders could negatively impact our revenues. As of March 31, 2007, we had an order backlog of $176.6 million, which we estimate will be fulfilled within the next 12 months. However, orders included in our backlog are subject to cancellation, delay or other modifications by our customers prior to fulfillment. For these reasons, we cannot assure you that orders included in our backlog will ultimately result in the actual receipt of revenues from such orders. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. To date we have not detected any material weakness or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. However, we are continuing to evaluate and, where appropriate, enhance our policies, procedures and internal controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. Any reduction of Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) distributions in the future would reduce our earnings and cash flows. The CDSOA provides for distribution of monies collected by the U.S. Customs Service from antidumping cases to qualifying domestic producers where the domestic producers have continued to invest in their technology, equipment and personnel. We reported approximately $1.2 million in CDSOA receipts for the year ended March 31, 2007. In February 2006, U.S. legislation was enacted that would end CDSOA distributions for imports covered by antidumping duty orders entering the United States after September 30, 2007. Instead, any such antidumping duties collected would remain with the U.S. Treasury. This legislation is not expected to have a significant effect on potential CDSOA distributions in our fiscal year ending 2008, but would be expected to reduce any distributions in years beyond our fiscal year ending 2008, with distributions eventually ceasing. In separate cases in July and September 2006, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, ruled that the procedure for determining recipients eligible to receive CDSOA distributions is unconstitutional. The CIT has not finally ruled on other matters, including any remedy as a result of its ruling. We are unable to determine, at this time, if these rulings will have a material adverse impact on our future receipt of CDSOA distributions or our financial results. It is possible that the CIT rulings might prevent us from receiving any CDSOA distributions in our fiscal year ending 2008. In addition to the CIT ruling, there are a number of other factors that can affect whether we receive any CDSOA distributions and the amount of such distributions in any year. These factors include, among other things, potential additional changes in the law, ongoing and potential additional legal challenges to the law, and the administrative operation of the law. Any reduction of CDSOA distributions would reduce our earnings and cash flow. Risk Factors Related to our Common Stock Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us. 15 Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include: · a classified board of directors; · advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; · the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; and · the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2¤3% of our shares entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation. In addition, absent approval of our board of directors, many of our bylaw provisions may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2¤3% of our shares entitled to vote. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of blank check preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, the board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock, including purchasers in this offering. Holders of the common stock will not have preemptive rights to subscribe for a pro rata portion of any capital stock which may be issued by us. In the event of issuance, such preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us. Although we have no present intention to issue any new shares of preferred stock, we may do so in the future. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Section 203 may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
