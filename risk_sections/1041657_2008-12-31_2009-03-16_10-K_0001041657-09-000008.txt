We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements because of new information, future events or otherwise. PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Radio One is one of the nation’s largest radio broadcasting companies and the largest broadcasting company that primarily targets African-American and urban listeners. We currently own 53 broadcast stations located in 16 urban markets in the United States. While our primary source of revenue is the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations, we have diversified our revenue streams by making acquisitions and investments in other complementary media properties. Most recently, in April 2008, we completed our acquisition of Community Connect Inc. (“CCI”), an online social networking company that hosts the website BlackPlanet, the largest social networking site primarily targeted at African-Americans. This acquisition is consistent with our operating strategy of becoming a multi-media entertainment and information content provider to African-American consumers. Our other media acquisitions and investments include our approximate 36% ownership interest in TV One, LLC (“TV One”), an African-American targeted cable television network that we invested in with an affiliate of Comcast Corporation and other investors; our 51% ownership interest in Reach Media, Inc. (“Reach Media”), which operates the Tom Joyner Morning Show; and our acquisition of certain net assets (“Giant Magazine”) of Giant Magazine, LLC, an urban-themed lifestyle and entertainment magazine. Through our national multi-media presence, we provide advertisers with a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to the African-American audience. While diversifying our operations, since December 2006, we have sold approximately $287.9 million of our non-core radio assets. While we maintained our core radio franchise, these dispositions have allowed the Company to more strategically allocate its resources consistent with its long-term multi-media operating strategy. As part of our consolidated financial statements, consistent with our financial reporting structure and how the Company currently manages its businesses, we have provided selected financial information on the Company’s two reportable segments: (i) Radio Broadcasting and (ii) Internet/Publishing. (See Note 17 of the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 – Segment Information.) Significant 2008 Events On February 20, 2008, Peter Thompson assumed the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of the Company. Mr. Thompson comes to the Company with over 20 years of financial experience and served as the Company’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Development from October 1, 2007 until his appointment as the Company’s CFO. Mr. Thompson assumed the role of CFO following the departure of Scott R. Royster, who left the Company on December 31, 2007. Acquisitions In June 2008, the Company purchased the assets of WPRS-FM, a radio station located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, for $38.0 million. From April 2007 and until closing, the station had been operated under a local marketing agreement (“LMA”), and the results of its operations were included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The station was consolidated with the Company’s existing Washington, DC operations in April 2007. In April 2008, the Company acquired CCI for $38.0 million in cash. CCI is an online social networking company operating branded websites including BlackPlanet, MiGente, and AsianAvenue. Dispositions Between December 2006 and May 2008, the Company sold the assets of 20 radio stations in seven markets for approximately $287.9 million in cash. These dispositions were consistent with the Company’s strategic plan to divest itself of non-core radio assets. Los Angeles Station: In May 2008, the Company sold the assets of its radio station KRBV-FM, located in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, to Bonneville International Corporation (“Bonneville”) for approximately $137.5 million in cash. Bonneville began operating the station under an LMA on April 8, 2008. Miami Station: In April 2008, the Company sold the assets of its radio station WMCU-AM (formerly WTPS-AM), located in the Miami metropolitan area, to Salem Communications Holding Corporation (“Salem”) for approximately $12.3 million in cash. Salem began operating the station under an LMA effective October 18, 2007. Augusta Stations: In December 2007, the Company sold the assets of its five radio stations in the Augusta metropolitan area to Perry Broadcasting Company for approximately $3.1 million in cash. Louisville Station: In November 2007, the Company sold the assets of its radio station WLRX-FM in the Louisville metropolitan area to WAY FM Media Group, Inc. for approximately $1.0 million in cash. Dayton and Louisville Stations: In September 2007, the Company sold the assets of its five radio stations in the Dayton metropolitan area and five of its six radio stations in the Louisville metropolitan area to Main Line Broadcasting, LLC for approximately $76.0 million in cash. Minneapolis Station: In August 2007, the Company sold the assets of its radio station KTTB-FM in the Minneapolis metropolitan area to Northern Lights Broadcasting, LLC for approximately $28.0 million in cash. Boston Station: In December 2006, the Company sold the assets of its radio station WILD-FM in the Boston metropolitan area to Entercom Boston, LLC (“Entercom”) for approximately $30.0 million in cash. Entercom began operating the station under an LMA effective August 18, 2006. 1 Our Stations and Markets The table below provides information about our radio stations and the markets in which we operated as of December 31, 2008.

(c) Population estimates are from the Arbitron Radio Market Report, Fall 2008. The African-American Market Opportunity We believe that urban-oriented media primarily targeting African-Americans continues as an attractive opportunity for the following reasons: Relative Outperformance versus General Market. Within our core radio business, based on reports prepared by the independent accounting firm Miller, Kaplan, Arase & Co., LLP (“Miller Kaplan”), 2008 total market revenue in the markets within which we operate declined 8.8% while our revenues within these markets declined by 6.1%. We attribute this outperformance to the unique multi-media platform we operate specifically targeting the African-American population and urban listeners. Based upon population growth trends, geographic concentration among the African-American population, income growth and the significant influence of African-American culture, we believe that targeting African-Americans through advertising continues to be an attractive opportunity. In addition, the growth in internet usage among African-Americans contrasted with the limited online content targeting the African-American and urban consumer represents a market opportunity that has yet to mature. Rapid African-American Population Growth. From 2000 to 2005, the African-American population grew 4.8%, compared to a 4.3% overall population growth rate, and accounted for 12.1% of total population growth. The African-American population is expected to increase by approximately 2.4 million between 2005 and 2010 to approximately 40.0 million, a 9.9% increase from 2000, compared to an expected increase during the same period of 6.0% for the non-African-American population. African-Americans are expected to make up 17.9% of total population growth during the period from 2005 through 2010. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2004, “U.S. Interim Projections by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin.”) According to the U.S. Census, the average African-American population is nearly five years younger than the total U.S. population average. As a result, urban formats, in general, tend to skew younger than formats targeted to the general market population. Within the next 30 years the African-American population is expected to exceed 50 million people and will represent more than 14% of the total U.S. population. The African-American consumer market represents an attractive customer segment in many states. (Source: The Multicultural Economy, the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, 2006 Edition). High African-American Geographic Concentration. An analysis of the African-American population shows a high degree of geographic concentration. A recent study shows that while the most populous five U.S. markets are home to 21.0% of the overall U.S. population, 27.0% of the African-American population resides in those same markets. Expanding the analysis to the most populous 20 U.S. markets, 45.0% of the overall U.S. population resides within these markets, with 57% of the African-American population residing within them. (Source: “Markets Within Markets,” CAB Race, Relevance and Revenue, June 2007). The practical implication of this concentration is that constructing a geographic media strategy across radio and the internet can have a much more meaningful reach towards the African-American population than non-African-American populations. 2 Higher African-American Income Growth. The economic status of African-Americans improved at an above-average rate over the past two decades. The per capita income of African-Americans is expected to increase 21.1% between 2005 and 2010 (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Historical Income Data). African-American buying power was estimated at $799 billion in 2006, up from $590 billion in 2000. African-American buying power is expected to increase to $1.1 trillion by 2011, up by 237.0% in 22 years. (Source: “Black Buying Power,” CAB Race, Relevance and Revenue, June 2007). In addition, African-American consumers tend to have a different consumption profile than do non-African-Americans. A report published by the Cable Advertising Bureau notes those products and services for which African-American households spent more or a higher proportion of their money than non-African-Americans. The products and services included apparel and accessories, appliances, consumer electronics, food, personal care products, telephone service and transportation. Such findings imply that utilities, telecom firms, clothing and grocers would greatly benefit from marketing directly to African-American consumers. This is particularly true in those states (including the District of Columbia) where African American buying power represents the largest share of total buying power within such states with the largest share of total African-American buying power, such as the District of Columbia (31.1%), Maryland (22.0%), Georgia (20.5%), North Carolina (14.5%) and Virginia (13.1%). (Source: “Black Buying Power,” CAB Race, Relevance and Revenue, June 2007). Growing Influence of African-American Culture. We believe that there continues to be an ongoing “urbanization” of many facets of American society as evidenced by the influence of African-American culture in the areas of politics, music, film, fashion, sports and urban-oriented television shows and networks. We believe that many companies from a broad range of industries and prominent fashion designers have embraced this urbanization trend in their products as well as their advertising messages. Growth in Advertising Targeting the African-American Market. We continue to believe that large corporate advertisers are becoming more focused on reaching minority consumers in the United States. The African-American community is considered an emerging growth market within a mature domestic market. Over the 12-month period October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007, advertisers spent $2.3 billion across all media targeting African-Americans. Of that amount, advertisers spent $805 million, or 35% of total media spending, on radio formats targeting African-Americans. Advertisers use radio to target African-Americans more than any other medium. (Source: “Big Ad-Spend on Radio Targeting Blacks” Mediaweek, January 29, 2008). We believe many large corporations are expanding their commitment to ethnic advertising. The companies that successfully market to the African-American audience have focused on building brand relationships. Advertisers are making an effort to fully understand the African-American consumer, and to relate to them with messages that are relevant to their community. They are accomplishing this by visibly and consistently engaging the African-American consumer, involving themselves with the interests of the African-American consumer and increasing African-American brand loyalty. Significant and Growing Internet Usage among African-Americans with Limited Targeted Online Content Offerings. African-Americans are becoming significant users of the internet. The same factors driving increases in African-American buying power, such as improvements in education, income and employment, are also increasing African-American internet usage. One study estimates that African-Americans will make up 11.8% of all U.S. internet users in 2011, up from 10.8% in 2006. (Source: "African Americans Online", eMarketer, 2007). In one of the more recent studies available that tracks internet usage patterns, African-Americans were found to use the internet more hours per day than the general online population. Additionally, the growth of internet penetration and high-speed internet penetration in African-American households is expected to remain above that of the general population. Furthermore, even with such high penetration, the overwhelming number of African-Americans says there is not enough online content that is targeted towards them as a distinct culture with its own needs and values. (Source: 2005 AOL African-American Cyberstudy, conducted for America Online by Images Market Research). In fact, we believe that there is no company that dominates the African-American market online and the lack of any strong competitive presence presents a significant opportunity for us to build an online business that is highly scalable. The Results of our Black America Study (www.blackamericastudy.com). In addition to relying on third-party research and our own experience, from time to time we conduct or commission our own proprietary research. In early 2008, we released the groundbreaking “Black America Study”. This national study, conducted by Yankelovich, a leader in consumer research for over 50 years, is one of the largest segmentation research studies ever done of Blacks and African-Americans. This study helps us to better understand the motivations of our core demographic by segmenting the large and growing African-American audience so that we can highlight the diversity that exists in Black America. This enhanced understanding helps us identify new opportunities to serve the African-American community and assists us in helping advertisers and marketers reach Black America more effectively. The study includes insight into African-Americans’ feelings about their future, past and present, as well as, details on their relationship with media, advertising and technology. The incredible wealth of quantifiable information about our listeners, viewers, readers and visitors provides invaluable marketing and programming applications for Radio One. This allows us to ensure that our content best reflects our audience and allows for companies, organizations and individuals to effectively reach this vital community. Business Strategy Radio Station Portfolio Optimization. Our strategy is to make select acquisitions of radio stations, primarily in markets where we already have a presence, and to divest stations which are no longer strategic in nature. We may divest stations that do not have an urban format or stations located in smaller markets or markets where the African-American population is smaller, on a relative basis, than other markets in which we operate. Since December 2006, we have completed the sale of approximately $287.9 million of our non-core radio assets in accordance with our portfolio optimization plan. Notwithstanding these dispositions, we are continually looking for opportunities to upgrade existing radio stations by strengthening their signals to reach a larger number of potential listeners. Investment in Complementary Businesses. We continue to invest in complementary businesses in the media and entertainment industry. The primary focus of these investments will be on businesses that provide entertainment and information content to African-American consumers. Such investments include the internet and publishing. Most recently, in April 2008, we acquired CCI, an online social networking company that hosts the website BlackPlanet, the largest social networking site primarily targeted at African-Americans. This acquisition is consistent with our operating strategy of becoming a multi-media entertainment and information content provider to African-American consumers. We believe that our unique position as a diversified media company focused on the African-American consumer provides us with a competitive advantage in these new businesses. 3 Top 50 African-American Radio Markets in the United States The table below notes the top 50 African-American radio markets in the United States. Boxes and bold text indicate markets where we own radio stations. Population estimates are for 2008 and are based upon data provided by Arbitron.

Complementing our core radio franchise are our cable, print and online media interests. Through our national presence across our various media, we provide our customers with a multi-media advertising platform that is a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to African-Americans. We believe that as we continue to diversify into other media, the strength and effectiveness of this unique platform will become even more compelling. The success of our strategy relies on the following: • market research, targeted programming and marketing; • ownership and syndication of programming content; • radio station clustering, programming segmentation and sales bundling; • strategic and coordinated sales, marketing and special event efforts; • strong management and performance-based incentives; and • significant community involvement. 4 Market Research, Targeted Programming and Marketing We use market research to tailor the programming, marketing and promotion of our radio stations and content of our complementary media to maximize audience share. We also use our research to reinforce our current programming and content and to identify unserved or underserved markets or segments of the African-American population and to determine whether to acquire new media properties or reprogram one of our existing media properties to target those markets or segments. We also seek to reinforce our targeted programming and content by creating a distinct and marketable identity for each of our media properties. To achieve this objective, in addition to our significant community involvement discussed below, we employ and promote distinct, high-profile personalities across our media properties, many of whom have strong ties to the African-American community. Ownership and Syndication of Programming Content To diversify our revenue base, we seek to develop or acquire proprietary African-American targeted content. We distribute this content in a variety of ways, utilizing our own network of multi-media distribution assets or through distribution assets owned by others. If we distribute content through others, we will be paid for providing this content or receive advertising inventory in exchange. To date, our programming content efforts have included our investment in TV One and its related programming, our acquisition of 51% of the common stock of Reach Media, the acquisition of Giant Magazine, the acquisition and development of our interactive brands including BlackPlanet, NewsOne, TheUrbanDaily and HelloBeautiful and the development of several syndicated radio shows. Radio Station Clustering, Programming Segmentation and Sales Bundling We strive to build clusters of radio stations in our markets, with each radio station targeting different demographic segments of the African-American population. This clustering and programming segmentation strategy allows us to achieve greater penetration into the distinct segments of our overall target market. In a similar fashion, we have multiple online brands including BlackPlanet, NewsOne, TheUrbanDaily and HelloBeautiful. Each of these brands focuses upon a different segment of African-American online users. With our radio station clusters and multiple online brands we are able to direct advertisers to specific audiences or to bundle the radio stations and brands for advertising sales purposes when advantageous. We believe there are several potential benefits that result from operating multiple radio stations in the same market and multiple online brands. First, each additional radio station in a market and online brand provides us with a larger percentage of the prime advertising time available for sale within that market and among online users. Second, the more stations we program and brands we operate, the greater the market share we can achieve in our target demographic groups through the use of segmented programming and content delivery. Third, we are often able to consolidate sales, promotional, technical support and business functions across stations and brands to produce substantial cost savings. Finally, the purchase of additional radio stations in an existing market and the development of additional online brands allow us to take advantage of our market expertise and existing relationships with advertisers. Sales, Marketing and Special Events We have assembled an effective, highly trained sales staff responsible for converting audience share into revenue. We operate with a focused, sales-oriented culture, which rewards aggressive selling efforts through a commission and bonus compensation structure. We hire and deploy large teams of sales professionals for each of our media properties or media clusters, and we provide these teams with the resources necessary to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate. We utilize various sales strategies to sell and market our properties on a stand-alone basis, in combination with other properties within a given market, and across our various media properties, where appropriate. We have created a national platform of radio stations in some of the largest African-American markets. This platform reaches approximately 12 million listeners weekly, more than that of any other radio broadcaster primarily targeting African-Americans. Given the high degree of geographic concentration among the African-American population, national advertisers find advertising on our radio stations an efficient and cost-effective way to reach this target audience. Through our corporate sales department, we bundle and sell our platform of radio stations to national advertisers, thereby enhancing our revenue generating opportunities, expanding our base of advertisers, creating greater demand for our advertising time inventory and increasing the capacity utilization of our inventory and making our sales efforts more efficient. We have also created a dedicated online and print sales force as part of our interactive unit. The unit’s national team focuses on helping marketers reach our online and print audience of approximately 8 million unique visitors. Our leading advertising products, custom solutions, and integrated inventory opportunities, allow marketers a unique vehicle to reach online African-American consumers at scale. To allow marketers to reach our audience across all of our platforms (radio, television, online and print) in an efficient way, we recently launched One Solution. One Solution is our a cross-platform/brand sales and marketing effort which allows top tier advertisers to take full advantage of our complete suite of offerings through a one-stop shop approach. In order to create advertising loyalty, we strive to be the recognized expert in marketing to the African-American consumer in the markets in which we operate. We believe that we have achieved this recognition by focusing on serving the African-American consumer and by creating innovative advertising campaigns and promotional tie-ins with our advertising clients and sponsoring numerous entertainment events each year. In these events, advertisers buy signage, booth space and broadcast promotions to sell a variety of goods and services to African-American consumers. As we expand our presence in our existing markets and into new markets, we may increase the number of events and the number of markets in which we host events based upon our evaluation of the financial viability and economic benefits of the events. Strong Management and Performance-Based Incentives We focus on hiring and retaining highly motivated and talented individuals in each functional area of our organization who can effectively help us implement our growth and operating strategies. Our management team is comprised of a diverse group of individuals who bring significant expertise to their functional areas. To enhance the quality of our management in the areas of sales and programming, general managers, sales managers and program directors have significant portions of their compensation tied to the achievement of certain performance goals. General Managers’ compensation is based partially on increasing market share and achieving station operating income benchmarks, which creates an incentive for management to focus on both sales growth and expense control. Additionally, sales managers and sales personnel have incentive packages based on sales goals, and program directors and on-air talent have incentive packages focused on maximizing ratings in specific target segments. Our One Solution sales approach seeks to drive incremental revenue and value across all of our media properties and includes performance based incentives for our sales team. Significant Community Involvement We believe our active involvement and significant relationships in the African-American community across our brands and in each of our markets provide a competitive advantage in targeting African-American audiences and significantly improve the marketability of our advertising to businesses that are targeting such communities. We believe that a media property’s image should reflect the lifestyle and viewpoints of the target demographic group it serves. Due to our fundamental understanding of the African-American community, we are well positioned to identify music and musical styles, as well as political and social trends and issues, early in their evolution. This understanding is then integrated into significant aspects of our operations across all of our media properties and enables us to create enhanced awareness and name recognition in the marketplace. In addition, we believe our approach to community involvement leads to increased effectiveness in developing and updating our programming formats and online brands and content which in turn leads to greater listenership and users of our online properties, driving higher ratings and online traffic over the long-term. 5 Our Radio Station Portfolio The following table sets forth selected information about our portfolio of radio stations as of December 31, 2008.

Substantially all the net revenue generated from our radio franchise is generated from the sale of local and national advertising. Local sales are made by the sales staff located in our markets. National sales are made primarily by a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level. This firm is paid a commission on the advertising sold. Approximately 58.0% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was generated from the sale of local advertising and 24.2% from sales to national advertisers, including network advertising. The balance of net revenue generated from our radio franchise is primarily derived from tower rental income, ticket sales and revenue related to Radio One sponsored events, management fees and other revenue. Advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on: • a radio station’s audience share within the demographic groups targeted by the advertisers; • the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups; and • the supply and demand for radio advertising time. A radio station’s listenership is measured by diary ratings surveys or the PPM metering system, both of which estimate the number of listeners tuned to a radio station and the time they spend listening to that radio station. Ratings are used by advertisers to evaluate whether to advertise on our radio stations, and are used by us to chart audience growth, set advertising rates and adjust programming. Advertising rates are generally highest during the morning and afternoon commuting hours. Strategic Diversification and Other Sources of Revenue We have expanded our operations to include other media forms that are complementary to our core radio business. Most recently, in April 2008, we acquired CCI, an online social networking company that hosts the website BlackPlanet, the largest social networking site primarily targeted at African-Americans. CCI currently generates the majority of the Company’s internet revenue, and derives such revenue principally from advertising services, including advertising aimed at diversity recruiting. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. Advertising revenue is recognized either as impressions (the number of times advertisements appear in viewed pages) are delivered, when “click through” purchases or leads are reported, or ratably over the contract period, where applicable. CCI has a diversity recruiting agreement with Monster, Inc. (“Monster”). Under the agreement, Monster posts job listings and advertising on CCI’s websites and CCI earns revenue for displaying the images on its websites. CCI is a part of our broader interactive unit which also includes the online brands NewsOne, TheUrbanDaily and HelloBeautiful. Similar to CCI, these web properties primarily derive their revenue from advertising services and revenue is recognized either as impressions are delivered, when “click through” purchases or leads are reported, or ratably over the contract, where applicable. In February 2005, we acquired 51% of the common stock of Reach Media, which operates The Tom Joyner Morning Show and related businesses. Reach Media primarily derives its revenue from the sale of advertising inventory in connection with its syndication agreements. Mr. Joyner is a leading nationally syndicated radio personality. As of December 31, 2008, The Tom Joyner Morning Show was broadcast on 108 affiliate stations across the United States and is a top-rated morning show in many of the markets in which it is broadcast. Reach Media provides programming content for TV One and operates www.BlackAmericaWeb.com, an African-American targeted web-site. Reach Media also operates the Tom Joyner Family Reunion and various other special event-related activities. In July 2003, we entered into a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of Comcast Corporation and other investors to create TV One, LLC, an entity formed to operate a cable television network featuring lifestyle, entertainment and news-related programming targeted primarily towards African-American viewers. At that time, we committed to make a cumulative cash investment of $74.0 million in TV One, of which $60.3 million had been funded as of December 31, 2008. The initial commitment period for funding the capital committed was extended to April 1, 2009, due in part to TV One's lower than anticipated capital needs during the initial commitment period. In December 2004, TV One entered into a distribution agreement with DIRECTV, Inc. ("DIRECTV") and certain affiliates of DIRECTV became investors in TV One. As of December 31, 2008, we owned approximately 36% of TV One on a fully-converted basis. We entered into separate network services and advertising services agreements with TV One in 2003. Under the network services agreement, we are providing TV One with administrative and operational support services and access to Radio One personalities. This agreement was originally scheduled to expire in January 2009, and has now been extended to January 2010. Under the advertising services agreement, we are providing a specified amount of advertising to TV One. This agreement was also originally scheduled to expire in January 2009, and has now been extended to January 2011. In consideration of providing these services, we have received equity in TV One, and receive an annual cash fee of $500,000 for providing services under the network services agreement. We have launched websites that simultaneously stream radio station content for 39 of our radio stations, and we derive revenue from the sale of advertisements on those websites. We generally encourage our web advertisers to run simultaneous radio campaigns and use our radio airwaves to promote our websites. By providing streaming, we have been able to broaden our listener reach, particularly to “office hour” listeners. We believe streaming has had a positive impact on our radio stations’ presence. In addition, our station websites link to our other online properties acting as traffic sources for these online brands. In December 2006, we acquired certain assets of Giant Magazine, an urban-themed music and lifestyle magazine. While we generally view the magazine business as a difficult business in which to operate, we believe that this magazine complements our existing asset base and can share resources across our platform of assets, including our radio stations, TV One, our interactive unit and our corporate back-office functions. Furthermore, Giant Magazine supports the content needs of our interactive unit. Future opportunities could include investments in, or acquisitions of, companies in diverse media businesses, music production and distribution, movie distribution, internet-based services, and distribution of our content through emerging distribution systems such as the internet, cellular phones, personal digital assistants, digital entertainment devices, and the home entertainment market. 7 Competition The media industry is highly competitive and we face intense competition in both our core radio franchise and in our complimentary media properties, including our interactive unit. Our media properties compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and with other media such as broadcast and cable television, the internet, satellite radio, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and outdoor advertising, some of which may be controlled by horizontally-integrated companies. Audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change and any adverse change in a market could adversely affect our net revenue in that market. If a competing station converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations, or if one of our competitors strengthens its operations, our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue. Other media companies which are larger and have more resources may also enter, or increase their presence in markets or segments in which we operate. Although we believe our media properties are well positioned to compete, we cannot assure that our properties will maintain or increase their current ratings, market share or advertising revenue. The radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies, which may impact our business. We cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies. Several new media technologies are being, or have been, developed including the following: • satellite delivered digital audio radio service, which has resulted in the introduction of several new satellite radio services with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs; • audio programming by cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite systems; and • digital audio and video content available for listening and/or viewing on the internet and/or available for downloading to portable devices. Along with most other public radio companies, we have invested in iBiquity, a developer of digital audio broadcast technology. We have committed by the end of 2009 to convert most of our analog broadcast radio stations to in-band, on-channel digital radio broadcasts, which could provide multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional AM and FM radio services. However, we cannot assure you that these arrangements will be successful or enable us to adapt effectively to these new media technologies. As of December 31, 2008, we had converted 45 stations to digital broadcast. Our interactive unit competes for the time and attention of internet users and, thus, advertisers and advertising revenues with a wide range of internet companies such as Yahoo! Inc., Google and Microsoft, social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook and traditional media companies, which are increasingly offering their own internet products and services. The internet is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and new and popular competitors, such as social networking sites, frequently emerge and/or are fragmented by new and evolving technologies. Antitrust Regulation The agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), may investigate acquisitions. The DOJ has challenged a number of media property transactions. Some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring, among other things, divestitures of certain media properties. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific DOJ or FTC review of a particular acquisition. For acquisitions meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act requires the parties to file Notification and Report Forms concerning antitrust issues with the DOJ and the FTC and to observe specified waiting period requirements before completing the acquisition. If the investigating agency raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction, the parties involved frequently engage in lengthy discussions and/or negotiations with the investigating agency to address those issues, including restructuring the proposed acquisition or divesting assets. In addition, the investigating agency could file suit in federal court to enjoin the acquisition or to require the divestiture of assets, among other remedies. All acquisitions, regardless of whether they are required to be reported under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, may be investigated by the DOJ or the FTC under the antitrust laws before or after completion. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws. The DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that local marketing agreements, joint sales agreements, time brokerage agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers could violate the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act if such agreements take effect prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The DOJ has established certain revenue and audience share concentration benchmarks with respect to radio station acquisitions, above which a transaction may receive additional antitrust scrutiny. The DOJ has also investigated transactions that do not meet or exceed these benchmarks and has cleared transactions that do exceed these benchmarks. Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting The radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) of ownership limitations, programming, technical operations, employment and other business practices. The FCC regulates radio broadcast stations pursuant to the Communications Act (the “Communications Act”) of 1934, as amended. The Communications Act permits the operation of radio broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. Among other things, the FCC: • assigns frequency bands for radio broadcasting; • determines the particular frequencies, locations, operating power, interference standards and other technical parameters of radio broadcast stations; • issues, renews, revokes and modifies radio broadcast station licenses; • imposes annual regulatory fees and application processing fees to recover its administrative costs; • establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment to restrict harmful emissions; • adopts and implements regulations and policies that affect the ownership, operation, program content and employment and business practices of radio broadcast stations; and • has the power to impose penalties, including monetary forfeitures, for violations of its rules and the Communications Act. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of an FCC license, or transfer of control of an FCC licensee, without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant or renew a radio broadcast license or consent to assignment or transfer of a license, the FCC considers a number of factors, including restrictions on foreign ownership, compliance with FCC media ownership limits and other FCC rules, the character and other qualifications of the licensee (or proposed licensee) and compliance with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. A licensee’s failure to comply with the requirements of the Communications Act or FCC rules and policies may result in the imposition of sanctions, including admonishment, fines, the grant of a license renewal of less than a full eight-year term or with conditions, denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of an FCC license and/or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. 8 Congress, the FCC and, in some cases, local jurisdictions, are considering and may in the future adopt new laws, regulations and policies that could affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our radio stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters include or may include: • changes to the license authorization and renewal process; • proposals to improve record keeping, including enhanced disclosure of stations’ efforts to serve the public interest; • proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees; • changes to rules relating to political broadcasting including proposals to grant free air time to candidates, and other changes regarding political and non-political program content, funding, political advertising rates, and sponsorship disclosures; • proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages; • proposals regarding the regulation of the broadcast of indecent or violent content; • proposals to increase the actions stations must take to demonstrate service to their local communities; • technical and frequency allocation matters, including increased protection of low power FM stations from interference by full-service stations; • changes in broadcast multiple ownership, foreign ownership, cross-ownership and ownership attribution policies; • changes to allow satellite radio operators to insert local content into their programming service; • additional public interest requirements for terrestrial digital audio broadcasters; • changes to allow telephone companies to deliver audio and video programming to homes in their service areas; and • proposals to alter provisions of the tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions. The FCC also has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed mutually exclusive applications for authority to construct new stations or certain major changes in existing stations. Such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our stations. We cannot predict what changes, if any, might be adopted or considered in the future, or what impact, if any, the implementation of any particular proposals or changes might have on our business. FCC License Grants and Renewals. In making licensing determinations, the FCC considers an applicant’s legal, technical, financial and other qualifications. The FCC grants radio broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew them for additional terms. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending. Under the Communications Act, radio broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. Generally, the FCC renews radio broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that: • the radio station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; • there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and • there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. After considering these factors and any petitions to deny a license renewal application (which may lead to a hearing), the FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted. Historically, our licenses have been renewed without any conditions or sanctions imposed; however, there can be no assurance that the licenses of each of our stations will be renewed for a full term without conditions or sanctions. Types of FCC Broadcast Licenses. The FCC classifies each AM and FM radio station. An AM radio station operates on either a clear channel, regional channel or local channel. A clear channel serves wide areas, particularly at night. A regional channel serves primarily a principal population center and the contiguous rural areas. A local channel serves primarily a community and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous to it. Class A, B and C radio stations each operate unlimited time. Class A radio stations render primary and secondary service over an extended area. Class B radio stations render service only over a primary service area. Class C radio stations render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference. Class D radio stations operate either daytime hours only, during limited times only, or unlimited time with low nighttime power. FM class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the FM radio station is located. The minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an FM radio station are determined by its class. In general, commercial FM radio stations are classified as follows, in order of increasing power and antenna height: Class A, B1, C3, B, C2, C1, C0 and C. The FCC has adopted a rule requiring Class C FM stations that do not satisfy a certain antenna height requirement to an involuntary downgrade in class to Class C0 under certain circumstances. 9 Radio One’s Licenses. The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations. A broadcast station’s market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an AM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station’s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the ERP of the radio station’s antenna and the HAAT of the radio station’s antenna. “ERP” refers to the effective radiated power of an FM radio station. “HAAT” refers to the antenna height above average terrain of an FM radio station.

To obtain the FCC’s prior consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license, an appropriate application must be filed with the FCC. If the assignment or transfer involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee, for example, the transfer or acquisition of more than 50% of the voting stock, the applicant must give public notice and the application is subject to a 30-day period for public comment. During this time, interested parties may file petitions with the FCC to deny the application. Informal objections may be filed any time until the FCC acts upon the application. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application, administrative procedures provide for petitions seeking reconsideration or full FCC review of the grant. The Communications Act also permits the appeal of a contested grant to a federal court in certain instances. Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any persons who are not U.S. citizens or by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. The Communications Act prohibits indirect foreign ownership through a parent company of the licensee of more than 25% if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any such entity, and the FCC has made such an affirmative finding only in limited circumstances. Since we serve as a holding company for subsidiaries that serve as licensees for our stations, we are effectively restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, foreign governments, representatives of foreign governments or foreign business entities. 10 The FCC generally applies its media ownership limits to “attributable” interests. The interests of officers, directors and those who directly or indirectly hold five percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of a corporation that holds a broadcast license are generally deemed attributable interests, as are any limited partnership or limited liability company interests that are not properly “insulated” from management activities. Passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only may hold attributable interests with the ownership of 20% or more of the voting stock of the licensee corporation. An entity with one or more radio stations in a market that enters into a local marketing agreement or a time brokerage agreement with another radio station in the same market obtains an attributable interest in the brokered radio station, if the brokering station supplies more than 15% of the brokered radio station’s weekly broadcast hours. Similarly, a radio station licensee’s rights under a joint sales agreement (“JSA”) to sell more than 15% per week of the advertising time on another radio station in the same market constitutes an attributable ownership interest in such station for purposes of the FCC’s ownership rules. Debt instruments, non-voting stock, unexercised options and warrants, minority voting interests in corporations having a single majority shareholder and limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where the interest holder is not “materially involved” in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company generally do not subject their holders to attribution unless such interests implicate the FCC’s equity-debt-plus (or “EDP”) rule. Under the EDP rule, a major programming supplier or a same-market media entity will have an attributable interest in a station if the supplier or same-market media entity also holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station’s total debt plus equity. For purposes of the EDP rule, equity includes all stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and interests held by limited partners or limited liability company members that are not materially involved. A major programming supplier is any supplier that provides more than 15% of the station’s weekly programming hours. The FCC has adopted revisions to the EDP rule to promote diversification of broadcast ownership, allowing the 33% EDP benchmark to be exceeded in certain circumstances that would enable an “eligible entity” (as defined by the FCC) to acquire a broadcast station. The Communications Act and FCC rules generally restrict ownership, operation or control of, or the common holding of attributable interests in: • radio broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market; • radio broadcast stations combined with television broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market (radio/television cross ownership); and • a radio broadcast station and an English-language daily newspaper serving the same local market (newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership), although in late 2007 the FCC adopted a revised rule that would allow a degree of same-market newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership based on certain presumptions, criteria and limitations. The media ownership rules are subject to periodic review by the FCC. In 2003, the FCC adopted new rules to modify ownership limits, to change the way a local radio market is defined and to make JSAs involving more than 15% of a same-market radio station’s advertising sales “attributable” under the ownership limits. The FCC grandfathered existing combinations of radio stations that would not comply with the modified rules. However, the FCC ruled that such noncompliant combinations could not be sold intact except to certain “eligible entities,” which the agency defined as entities qualifying as a small business consistent with Small Business Administration standards. The 2003 rules were challenged in court and the Third Circuit stayed their implementation, among other things, on the basis that the FCC did not adequately justify its radio ownership limits. Subsequently, the Third Circuit partially lifted its stay to allow the new local market definition, JSA attribution rule and grandfather rules to go into effect. The FCC currently is applying such revisions to pending and new applications. The numerical limits on radio stations that one entity may own in a local market are as follows: • in a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM); • in a radio market with 30 to 44 commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM); • in a radio market with 15 to 29 commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM); and • in a radio market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not own, operate, or control more than 50% of the radio stations in such market. To apply these tiers, the FCC currently relies on Arbitron Metro Survey Areas, where they exist. In other areas, the FCC relies on a contour-overlap methodology. Under this approach, the FCC uses one overlapping contour methodology for defining a local radio market and counting the number of stations that the applicant controls or proposes to control in that market, and it employs a separate overlapping contour methodology for determining the number of operating commercial radio stations in the market for determining compliance with the local radio ownership caps. For radio stations located outside Arbitron Metro Survey Areas, the FCC is undertaking a rulemaking to determine how to define local radio markets in areas located outside Arbitron Metro Survey Areas. The market definition used by the FCC in applying its ownership rules may not be the same as that used for purposes of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. In its 2003 media ownership decision, the FCC adopted new cross-media limits to replace the former newspaper-broadcast and radio-television cross-ownership rules. These provisions were remanded by the Third Circuit for further FCC consideration and are currently subject to a judicial stay. In 2006, the FCC commenced a new rule making proceeding which it addressed the next periodic review and issues on remand from the Third Circuit. At an open meeting on December 18, 2007, the FCC adopted a decision in that proceeding. It revised the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule to allow a degree of same-market newspaper/broadcast ownership based on certain presumptions, criteria and limitations. It made no changes to the currently effective local radio ownership rules (as modified in 2003) or the radio/television cross-ownership rule (as modified in 1999). The FCC’s 2007 decision is the subject of a request for reconsideration and various court appeals. The attribution and media ownership rules limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any particular market and may limit the prospective buyers of any stations we want to sell. The FCC’s rules could affect our business in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following: • enforcement of a more narrow market definition based upon Arbitron markets could have an adverse effect on our ability to accumulate stations in a given area or to sell a group of stations in a local market to a single entity; • restricting the assignment and transfer of control of radio combinations that exceed the new ownership limits as a result of the revised local market definitions could adversely affect our ability to buy or sell a group of stations in a local market from or to a single entity; and • in general terms, future changes in the way the FCC defines radio markets or in the numerical station caps could limit our ability to acquire new stations in certain markets, our ability to operate stations pursuant to certain agreements, and our ability to improve the coverage contours of our existing stations. 11 Programming and Operations. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest” by presenting programming in response to community problems, needs and interests and maintaining records demonstrating its responsiveness. The FCC considers complaints from listeners about a broadcast station’s programming, and the station is required to maintain complaints on public file for two years. In November 2007, the FCC adopted rules establishing a standardized form for reporting information on a television station’s public interest programming and requiring television broadcasters to post the new form, as well as other documents in their public inspection files, on station websites. The FCC is considering whether to adopt similar rules for radio stations. Moreover, in December 2007, the FCC adopted a report and proposed rules designed to increase local programming content and diversity, including renewal application processing guidelines for locally-oriented programming and a requirement that broadcasters establish advisory boards in the communities where they own stations. Stations also must follow FCC rules regulating political advertising, obscene or indecent programming, sponsorship identification, contests and lotteries and technical operation, including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation. The FCC’s rules prohibit a broadcast licensee from simulcasting more than 25% of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service (that is, AM/AM or FM/FM). The simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement, and only if the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner. The FCC requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or gender. They also require stations with at least five full-time employees to disseminate information about all full-time job openings and undertake outreach initiatives from an FCC list of activities such as participation in job fairs, internships or scholarship programs. The FCC is considering whether to apply these recruitment requirements to part-time employment positions. Stations must retain records of their outreach efforts and keep an annual Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) report in their public inspection files and post an electronic version on their websites. Radio stations with more than 10 full-time employees must file certain annual EEO reports with the FCC midway through their license term. From time to time, complaints may be filed against Radio One’s radio stations alleging violations of these or other rules. In addition, the FCC may conduct audits or inspections to ensure and verify licensee compliance with FCC rules and regulations. Failure to observe these or other rules and regulations can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including fines or conditions, the grant of “short” (less than the maximum eight year) renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license. Employees As of February 15, 2009, we employed 1,000 full-time employees and 395 part-time employees. Our employees are not unionized; however, some of our employees were at one point covered by collective bargaining agreements that we assumed in connection with certain of our station acquisitions. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe relations with our employees are satisfactory. Corporate Governance Code of Ethics. We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers (including our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) and employees and meets the requirements of the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. Our code of ethics can be found on our website, www.radio-one.com. We will provide a paper copy of the Code of Ethics, free of charge, upon request. Audit Committee Charter.

RISK FACTORS Our future operating results could be adversely affected by a number of risks and uncertainties, the most significant of which are described below. The global financial crisis and deteriorating U.S. economy may have an unpredictable impact on our business and financial condition. The capital and credit markets have recently been experiencing unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and limited credit capacity for certain companies without regard to those companies’ underlying financial strength. In addition, the weakening economy has produced a drop in consumer confidence and spending, which has impacted corporate profits and resulted in cutbacks in advertising budgets. If the economic downturn and current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience a further adverse effect, which may be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to access capital. For example, the continued worsening of the economy and continuation of the market and capital crisis could further adversely impact the overall demand for advertising, which could have a negative effect on our revenues and results of operations. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. A continued worsening of the economy could negatively impact our ability to meet our cash needs and our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. Based on our most recent projections, we believe the Company can meet its liquidity needs and maintain compliance with its debt covenants through the end of fiscal year 2009. However, a worsening of the economy may negatively impact our operations beyond those assumed in our projections, and could lead us to implement certain remedial measures in order to meet our liquidity needs and to remain in compliance with our debt covenants. Such measures may include further operating cost and capital expenditure reductions and additional de-leveraging actions. If these measures are unsuccessful, we would attempt to negotiate for covenant relief through an amendment or waivers of covenant noncompliance with our lenders, which could result in higher interest costs, additional fees and reduced borrowing capacity. If the Company cannot maintain compliance with its debt covenants, there is no assurance we would be able to negotiate amendment relief or waivers of covenant noncompliance with our lenders. Failure to comply with our debt covenants and failure to negotiate a favorable amendment or waivers of covenant noncompliance could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all our outstanding debt, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 12 Our revenue is substantially dependent on spending and allocation decisions by advertisers, and seasonality and/or weakening economic conditions may have an impact upon our business. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from sales of advertisements and program sponsorships to local and national advertisers. Cutbacks or changes in advertisers' spending priorities and allocations across different types of media may affect our results. We do not obtain long-term commitments from our advertisers and advertisers may cancel, reduce or postpone advertisements without penalty, which could adversely affect our revenue. Seasonal net revenue fluctuations are common in the media industries and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. In addition, advertising revenues in even-numbered years benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices. The effects of such seasonality make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect operating results. Advertising expenditures also tend to be cyclical and reflect general economic conditions both nationally and locally. Because the Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of advertising, a decline or delay in advertising expenditures could reduce the Company’s revenues or hinder its ability to increase these revenues. Advertising expenditures by companies in certain sectors of the economy, including the automotive, financial, entertainment and retail industries, represent a significant portion of the Company’s advertising revenues. Structural changes, consolidation or business failures in any of these industries resulting from the current economic environment could have a significant impact on our revenues. Any political, economic, social or technological change resulting in a significant reduction in the advertising spending of these sectors could adversely affect the Company’s advertising revenues or its ability to increase such revenues. In addition, because many of the products and services offered by the Company’s advertisers are largely discretionary items, weakening economic conditions or outlook could reduce the consumption of such products and services and, thus, reduce advertising for such products and services. Changes in advertisers' spending priorities during economic cycles may also affect our results. Disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities also could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. Pricing for advertising may continue to face downward pressure. During 2008, in response to the deteriorating economy, advertisers increasingly purchased lower-priced inventory rather than higher-priced inventory, and increasingly demanded lower pricing, in addition to increasingly purchasing later and through advertising inventory from third party advertising networks. If advertisers continue to demand lower-priced inventory and continue to put downward pressure on pricing, our operating margins and ability to generate revenue could be further adversely affected. The Company’s success is dependant upon audience acceptance of its content, particularly its radio programs, which is difficult to predict. Media and radio content production and distribution are inherently risky businesses because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of media content or a radio program, and the licensing of rights to the intellectual property associated with the content or program, depend primarily upon their acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of content or a program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Finally, the costs of content and programming may change significantly if new performance royalties are imposed upon radio broadcasters or internet operators and such changes could have a material impact upon our business. Ratings for broadcast stations and traffic or visitors on a particular website are also factors that are weighed when advertisers determine outlets to use and in determining the advertising rates that the outlet receives. Poor ratings or traffic levels can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenues. For example, if there is an event causing a change of programming at one of the Company’s stations, there could be no assurance that any replacement programming would generate the same level of ratings, revenues or profitability as the previous programming. In addition, changes in ratings methodology and technology, such as the rollout of the PPM, could adversely impact upon our ratings. A disproportionate share of our net revenue comes from radio stations in a small number of geographic markets and from Reach Media. Within our core radio business, four of the 16 markets in which we operate radio stations accounted for approximately 50.5% of our radio station net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008. Revenue from the operations of Reach Media, along with revenue from both the Houston and Washington, DC markets accounted for approximately 39.5% of our total consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008. Adverse events or conditions (economic or otherwise) could lead to declines in the contribution of Reach Media or to declines in one or more of the significant contributing markets (Houston, Washington, DC, Atlanta and Baltimore), which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial performance and results of operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a single customer. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we derived approximately 10.5% of our total revenues from a single customer. If that customer were to cease or substantially reduce its use of our media outlets for advertising, it could have a material adverse affect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our agreement with this customer expires December 31, 2009 and our ability to replace or renew this agreement with substantially similar terms is not guaranteed. There is no assurance that we would be able to replace these lost revenues with revenues from new or other existing customers. In addition, any impact from the current global financial crisis and the deteriorating U.S. economy on the business of this customer, or its ability to meet its financial obligations, could potentially have a material adverse affect on our business during the term of the agreement. We may lose audience share and advertising revenue to our competitors. Our radio stations and other media properties compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and station groups and other media such as broadcast television, newspapers, magazines, cable television, satellite television, satellite radio, outdoor advertising, the internet and direct mail. Adverse changes in audience ratings, internet traffic and market shares could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. Larger media companies with more financial resources than we have may enter the markets in which we operate. Other media and broadcast companies may change their programming format or engage in aggressive promotional campaigns to compete directly with our media properties for audiences and advertisers. This competition could result in lower ratings or traffic and, hence, lower advertising revenue for us or cause us to increase promotion and other expenses and, consequently, lower our earnings and cash flow. Changes in population, demographics, audience tastes and other factors beyond our control could also cause changes in audience ratings or market share. Failure by us to respond successfully to these changes could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenue. 13 If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate businesses pursuant to our diversification strategy, our business and prospects may be adversely impacted. We are pursuing a strategy of acquiring and investing in other forms of media that complement our core radio business in an effort to grow and diversify our business and revenue streams. This strategy depends on our ability to find suitable opportunities and obtain acceptable financing. Negotiating transactions and integrating an acquired business could result in significant costs and use of management’s time and resources. Our diversification strategy partially depends on our ability to identify attractive media properties at reasonable prices and to divest properties that are no longer strategic to our business. Some of the material risks that could hinder our ability to implement this strategy include: • reduction in the number of suitable acquisition targets due to increased competition for acquisitions; • we may lose key employees of acquired companies or stations; • new businesses may subject us to additional risk factors; • difficulty in integrating operations and systems and managing a diverse media business; • inability to find buyers for radio stations we target for sale at attractive prices due to decreasing market prices for radio stations or the inability to obtain credit in the current economic environment; • failure or delays in completing acquisitions or divestitures due to difficulties in obtaining required regulatory approval, including possible difficulties by the seller or buyer in obtaining antitrust approval for acquisitions in markets where we already own multiple stations or establishing compliance with broadcast ownership rules; • failure of some acquisitions to prove profitable or generate sufficient cash flow; and • inability to finance acquisitions on acceptable terms, through incurring debt or issuing stock. We can provide no assurance that our diversification strategy will be successful. We must respond to the rapid changes in technology, services and standards, in order to remain competitive. Technological standards across our media properties are evolving and new media technologies are emerging. We cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services to compete with these new technologies. Several new media technologies are being, or have been, developed, including the following: • satellite delivered digital audio radio service, which has resulted in the introduction of several new satellite radio services with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs; • audio programming by cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite systems, internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats; and • digital audio and video content available for listening and/or viewing on the internet and/or available for downloading to portable devices. We cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt successfully to these new media technologies. The loss of key personnel, including on-air talent, could disrupt the management and operations of our business. Our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees, including on-air personalities. We believe that the combination of skills and experience possessed by our executive officers could be difficult to replace, and that the loss of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us, including the impairment of our ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, several of our on-air personalities and syndicated radio programs hosts have large loyal audiences in their respective broadcast areas and may be significantly responsible for the ranking of a station. The loss of such on-air personalities could impact the ability of the station to sell advertising and our ability to derive revenue from syndicating programs hosted by them. We cannot be assured that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current audiences or ratings. As a part of our diversification strategy, we have placed emphasis on building our internet businesses. Failure to fulfill this undertaking may adversely affect our brands and business prospects. Our diversification strategy depends to a significant degree upon the development of our internet businesses. In order for our internet businesses to grow and succeed over the long-term, we must, among other things: · significantly increase our online traffic and revenue; · attract and retain a base of frequent visitors to our web sites; · expand the content, products and tools we offer on our web sites; · respond to competitive developments while maintaining a distinct identity across each of our on-line brands; · attract and retain talent for critical positions; · maintain and form relationships with strategic partners to attract more consumers; · continue to develop and upgrade our technologies; and · bring new product features to market in a timely manner. We cannot assure that we will be successful in achieving these and other necessary objectives. If we are not successful in achieving these objectives, our business, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. 14 If our interactive unit does not continue to develop and offer compelling and differentiated content, products and services, our advertising revenues could be adversely affected. In order to attract internet consumers and generate increased activity on our internet properties, we believe that we must offer compelling and differentiated content, products and services. However, acquiring, developing and offering such content, products and services may require significant costs and time to develop, while consumer tastes may be difficult to predict and are subject to rapid change. If we are unable to provide content, products and services that are sufficiently attractive to our internet users, we may not be able to generate the increases in activity necessary to generate increased advertising revenues. In addition, although we have access to certain content provided by the Company’s other businesses, we may be required to make substantial payments to license such content. Many of our content arrangements with third parties are non-exclusive, so competitors may be able to offer similar or identical content. If we are not able to acquire or develop compelling content and do so at reasonable prices, or if other companies offer content that is similar to that provided by our interactive unit, we may not be able to attract and increase the engagement of internet consumers on our internet properties. Continued growth in our internet advertising business also depends on our ability to continue offering a competitive and distinctive range of advertising products and services for advertisers and publishers and our ability to maintain or increase prices for our advertising products and services. Continuing to develop and improve these products and services may require significant time and costs. If we cannot continue to develop and improve its advertising products and services or if prices for its advertising products and services decrease, our internet advertising revenues could be adversely affected. More individuals are using devices other than personal and laptop computers to access and use the internet, and if we cannot make our products and services available and attractive to consumers via these alternative devices, our internet advertising revenues could be adversely affected. Internet users are increasingly accessing and using the internet through devices other than a personal or laptop computer, such as personal digital assistants or mobile telephones, which differ from computers with respect to memory, functionality, resolution and screen size. In order for consumers to access and use our products and services via these alternative devices, we must ensure that our products and services are technologically compatible with such devices. We also must secure arrangements with device manufacturers and wireless carriers in order to have placement and functionality on the alternative devices and to more effectively reach consumers. If we cannot effectively make our products and services available on alternative devices, fewer internet consumers may access and use our products and services and our advertising revenue may be negatively affected. Our business depends on maintaining our licenses with the FCC. We could be prevented from operating a radio station if we fail to maintain its license. We are required to maintain radio broadcasting licenses issued by the FCC. These licenses are ordinarily issued for a maximum term of eight years and are renewable. Our radio broadcasting licenses expire at various times through August 1, 2014. Interested third parties may challenge our renewal applications. In addition, we are subject to extensive and changing regulation by the FCC with respect to such matters as programming, indecency standards, technical operations, employment and business practices. If we or any of our significant stockholders, officers, or directors violate the FCC’s rules and regulations or the Communications Act, or is convicted of a felony, the FCC may commence a proceeding to impose fines or sanctions upon us. Examples of possible sanctions include the imposition of fines, the renewal of one or more of our broadcasting licenses for a term of fewer than eight years or the revocation of our broadcast licenses. If the FCC were to issue an order denying a license renewal application or revoking a license, we would be required to cease operating the radio station covered by the license only after we had exhausted administrative and judicial review without success. There is significant uncertainty regarding the FCC’s media ownership rules, and such rules could restrict our ability to acquire radio stations. The Communications Act and FCC rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own (directly or by attribution) in any market and require FCC approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses. The FCC’s media ownership rules remain in flux and subject to further agency and court proceedings. (See “Business — Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting.”) In addition to the FCC media ownership rules, the outside media interests of our officers and directors could limit our ability to acquire stations. The filing of petitions or complaints against Radio One or any FCC licensee from which we are acquiring a station could result in the FCC delaying the grant of, or refusing to grant or imposing conditions on its consent to the assignment or transfer of control of licenses. The Communications Act and FCC rules and policies also impose limitations on non-U.S. ownership and voting of our capital stock. Increased enforcement by the FCC of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry. In 2004, the FCC indicated that it was enhancing its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency. Congress has increased the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming and potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation, renewal or qualification proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material. In addition, the FCC’s heightened focus on the indecency regulatory scheme, against the broadcast industry generally, may encourage third parties to oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations. The change in administration at the federal level could foster a change in the FCC’s enforcement posture. Future asset impairment to the carrying values of our FCC licenses and goodwill could adversely impact our results of operations and net worth. FCC licenses and goodwill totaled approximately $900.8 million or 80.0% of total assets at December 31, 2008, and is primarily attributable to accounting for acquisitions in past years. We are required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which we have traditionally done in the fourth quarter. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset over its fair value. Impairment may result from deterioration in our performance, changes in anticipated future cash flows, changes in business plans, adverse economic or market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, or other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed as a charge to operations. Fair values of FCC licenses and goodwill have been estimated using the income approach, which involves a 10-year model that incorporates several judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analysis. Changes in certain events or circumstances could result in changes to our estimated fair values, and may result in further write-downs to the carrying values of these assets. Additional impairment charges could adversely affect our financial results, financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future. We have incurred net losses over the past three years. We have reported net losses in our consolidated statements of operations over the past three years, due mostly in part to recording non-cash impairment charges for write-downs to radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill, net losses incurred for discontinued operations and revenue declines caused by weakened advertising demand resulting from the current economic crisis. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we experienced net losses of approximately $302.9 million, $391.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively. These results have had a negative impact on our financial condition and could be exacerbated given the current economic climate. If these trends continue in the future, it could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition. New or changing federal, state or international privacy legislation or regulation could hinder the growth of our internet business. A variety of federal and state laws govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data that our internet business uses to operate its services and to deliver certain advertisements to its customers, as well as the technologies used to collect such data. Not only are existing privacy-related laws in these jurisdictions evolving and subject to potentially disparate interpretation by governmental entities, new legislative proposals affecting privacy are now pending at both the federal and state level in the U.S. Changes to the interpretation of existing law or the adoption of new privacy-related requirements could hinder the growth of our internet business. Also, a failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws or requirements or with our own policies and procedures could result in significant liabilities, including a possible loss of consumer or investor confidence or a loss of customers or advertisers. 15 Our operation of various real properties and facilities could lead to environmental liability. As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance, however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds. Two common stockholders have a majority voting interest in Radio One and have the power to control matters on which our common stockholders may vote, and their interests may conflict with yours. As of February 15, 2009, our Chairperson and her son, our President and CEO, collectively held approximately 92% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock. As a result, our Chairperson and the CEO will control our management and policies and most decisions involving Radio One, including transactions involving a change of control, such as a sale or merger. In addition, certain covenants in our debt instruments require that our Chairperson and the CEO maintain a specified ownership and voting interest in Radio One, and prohibit other parties’ voting interests from exceeding specified amounts. In addition, the TV One operating agreement provides for adverse consequences to Radio One in the event our Chairperson and CEO fail to maintain a specified ownership and voting interest in us. Our Chairperson and the CEO have agreed to vote their shares together in elections of members to the board of directors. Our substantial level of debt could limit our ability to grow and compete. As of February 20, 2009, we had indebtedness of approximately $682.7 million. In June 2005, we borrowed $437.5 million under our credit facility to retire all outstanding obligations under our previous credit facilities. Draw downs of revolving loans under the credit facility are subject to compliance with provisions of our credit agreement, including, but not limited to, certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2008, we are permitted to borrow up to an additional $25.9 million under our current credit facility. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” A portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates. Increases in interest rates could increase the cost of our credit facilities. We have entered into various interest rate hedges to reduce our overall exposure to variable interest rates, consistent with the Credit Agreement that requires at least 50% of our debt obligations be fixed rate in nature. Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect us for various reasons, including limiting our ability to: • obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt payments or other corporate purposes; • have sufficient funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes, after paying debt service; • compete with competitors that have less debt; and • react to changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns. Our corporate debt rating was recently downgraded and we could suffer further downgrades. On a continuing basis, credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investor Services (“Moody’s”) evaluate our debt. On March 3, 2009, S&P lowered our corporate credit rating to B- from B and the issue-level rating on our $800.0 million secured credit facility to B- from BB-. While noting that our rating outlook was negative, the ratings downgrade reflects concern over the Company’s ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants due to weak radio advertising demand amid the deepening recession, which S&P expects to persist for all of 2009. On November 3, 2008, Moody’s placed on review the Company and its debt for a possible downgrade. The review was prompted by heightened concerns that the radio broadcast sector will likely face significant revenue and cash flow deterioration due to the high probability of further deterioration in the U.S. economy and its impact on advertising revenue. On September 10, 2008, Moody’s downgraded our corporate family rating to B2 from B1 and our $800.0 million secured credit facility ($500.0 million revolver, $300.0 million term loan) to Ba3 from Ba2. In addition, Moody’s downgraded our 87/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due July 2011 and 63/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due February 2013 to Caa1 from B3. While noting that our rating outlook was stable, the ratings downgrade reflected the Company’s operating performance, weaker than previously expected credit metrics and limited borrowing capacity under financial covenants. Although reductions in our bond ratings may not have an immediate impact on our cost of debt or liquidity, they may impact our cost of debt and liquidity. Increased debt levels and/or decreased earnings could result in further downgrades in our credit ratings, which, in turn, could impede our access to the debt markets, reduce the total amount of commercial paper we could issue, raise our commercial paper borrowing costs and/or raise our long-term debt borrowing rates. Our ability to use debt to fund major new acquisitions or new business initiatives could also be limited. We could incur adverse effects from our voluntary review of stock option grants and resulting financial restatements. As described in the Explanatory Note and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements filed with our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded additional stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to certain past stock option grants, and restated certain previously filed financial statements included in that Form 10-K. In February 2007, we received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC regarding the review of our stock option accounting. While we have not heard further from the SEC on this matter to date, should the SEC further inquire we would fully cooperate with the SEC’s inquiry. We are unable to predict whether a formal inquiry will be initiated or what consequences any further inquiry may have on us. We are unable to predict the likelihood of or potential outcomes from litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions relating to our past stock option practices. The resolution of these matters could be time-consuming and expensive, further distract management from other business concerns and harm our business. Furthermore, if we were subject to adverse findings in litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed, which could harm our business and financial condition. While we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for our historical stock option grants, the SEC may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported the financial impact. Accordingly, there is a risk we may have to further restate prior financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated. We are currently not in compliance with NASDAQ rules for continued listing of our Class A and Class D common shares. Our shares of Class A and Class D common stock are currently not in compliance with NASDAQ rules for continued listing and may be at risk of being delisted. On May 21, 2008, the Company received a letter (the “Notification”) from The NASDAQ Stock Market notifying the Company that for the prior 30 consecutive trading days, the Company’s Class A common shares (the “Class A Shares”) had not maintained a minimum market value of publicly held shares (“MVPHS”) of $5.0 million as required for continued inclusion by Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(2) (the “Rule”). In accordance with Marketplace Rule 4450(e)(1), the Company was provided 90 calendar days, or until August 19, 2008, to regain compliance. On August 26, 2008, Radio One, Inc. announced that it had received approval from The NASDAQ Stock Market to transfer the listing of its Class A Shares from The NASDAQ Global Market to The NASDAQ Capital Market. The transfer became effective at the opening of business on August 27, 2008. Since that time, macroeconomic and extraordinary market conditions have depressed the trading price of our shares and our shares of Class D common stock traded under the NASDAQ minimum bid price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days and, thus, are at risk for delisting. Shares of our Class A common stock have traded under $1.00 since October 8, 2008 and similarly could face delisting proceedings. On October 16, 2008, given the macroeconomic and extraordinary market conditions, NASDAQ suspended the minimum bid price and MVPHS requirements through January 16, 2009. In that regard, on October 16, 2008, NASDAQ filed an immediately effective rule change with the SEC, such that companies will not be cited for any new concerns related to minimum bid price or MVPHS deficiencies. On December 19, 2008, given the continued difficulties in the markets, NASDAQ extended the suspension through April 20, 2009. Currently, it is anticipated that the minimum bid price and MVPHS rules will be reinstated on April 20, 2009. While NASDAQ’s suspension of the minimum bid price and MVPHS rules does provide us with time in which market conditions may help cure the deficiencies, there can be no assurance that on April 20, 2009 we will meet the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement for shares of either our Class A or Class D common stock. Our failure to meet such requirements may subject us to delisting and could result in decreased liquidity for our Class A and Class D common stock. The foregoing list is not exhaustive. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business. Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our debt agreements contain covenants that may limit our ability to borrow additional money, purchase or sell assets, incur liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, consolidations or mergers, and other restrictive covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. 16 ITEM 1B.
