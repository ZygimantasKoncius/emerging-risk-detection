ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are risks related to our business: OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO VARY. WE RECOGNIZED LOSSES FOR THE PAST TWO FISCAL YEARS. We incurred losses of approximately $1.6 million for fiscal 2010 and $2.7 million for fiscal 2009. Our net losses may continue and our ability to return to profitability will be impacted by: o the short-term nature of client's commitments because of shorter-term projects rather than long-term contracts o patterns of capital spending by clients, as the industry continues to experience a sluggish IT spending environment o general economic conditions o pricing changes in response to competitive factors, often driving prices and profit margins down o our revenues may not increase or remain at current levels o our ability to access sufficient working capital and/or vendor credit to fund sales and operating activities o timing and customer acceptance of new product and service offerings o trends in IT outsourcing, as clients reduce the number of vendors o the availability and related costs of attracting and retaining qualified sales and technical personnel FAILURE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THE MARKETPLACE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. We operate in an intensely competitive industry. We compete with small boutique IT firms as well as large, global companies, including manufacturers who now compete against us to sell directly to the customer. Although we feel we offer our clients a wide range of highly sophisticated professional services in conjunction with a select product line, increased competition may create greater pressure to further reduce prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. GENERAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO CREDIT MARKETS, MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Economic conditions since September 2008, notably the decline in the economy, businesses, consumer confidence, and increased unemployment have resulted in volatility and general economic slowdowns not seen in decades. National economic conditions have resulted in dramatic changes in the availability of credit and dramatic slowdowns in business. Continued concerns about economic recovery have hampered growth. As a result of these conditions the availability of capital and credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected. If these market conditions continue, they may limit our ability and that of our customers to timely access the capital and credit necessary for business operations, and may affect our financial condition and results of operation. WE REQUIRE ACCESS TO WORKING CAPITAL AND VENDOR CREDIT TO FUND OUR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. We require access to working capital to fund our day-to-day operations, particularly at the end of our fiscal quarters when demand for our products and services increase. Termination of the arrangements or acceleration of payment due under these arrangements would have an adverse impact upon our financial condition. 7 WE MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SALES AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. We rely upon our ability to find, attract, and retain qualified sales and technical personnel. At present, there is a shortage of qualified personnel and we are in direct competition for these applicants with larger businesses to hire from this limited pool of qualified applicants. WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR REVENUE FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CLIENTS. IF WE WERE TO LOSE ONE OR MORE OF THESE CLIENTS, AND THE BUSINESS WERE NOT REPLACED, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. While no customer currently accounts for 10% or more of our revenues, our top ten clients account for a significant amount of our business. Although we anticipate our business to continue with these clients, the loss of a number of large clients could have an adverse impact on our Corporation's results of operations if that revenue stream was not replaced from alternative sources. WE MUST MAINTAIN AUTHORIZATIONS FROM MAJOR MANUFACTURERS TO OPERATE AS AN AUTHORIZED RESELLER AND/OR SERVICE PROVIDER TO PROVIDE THE RESPECTIVE MANUFACTURER'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. We must maintain our authorized status as an authorized reseller or authorized service provider in order to market the products of most major manufacturers. Such authorizations are conditioned upon our continued ability to meet specified requirements, usually related to technical skill levels of our personnel. Although we do not foresee any problem in maintaining our authorizations or obtaining future authorizations, without these authorizations or suitable replacements, we would not be able to offer our clients the products we currently market. WE PURCHASE PRODUCT FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS. The majority of our purchases are made from a single supplier who provides us with discounted prices. Although the product purchased from that supplier is available from other sources, if that supplier relationship were terminated, we may not be able to obtain the products at the same discounted pricing, and that may have an adverse impact on our ability to compete and our profit margins. A PORTION OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM GOVERNMENTAL CLIENTS. A portion of our revenue is derived from contracts with state and local governments and governmental agencies. Future statutes and/or regulations, and/or changes in purchasing methods or purchasing levels by these entities may affect future revenues and/or profitability of these contracts. OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO PRICING PRESSURES. Although we believe our pricing is competitive, certain of our competitors may offer more aggressive pricing to customers. Pricing pressure and competition for a reduced amount of business have intensified in the current economic downturn. As we have previously reported, the IT industry is subject to price reductions, and we believe that the current economic conditions may continue to intensify pricing pressure. As a result, we may have to lower prices to remain competitive, and reduced prices would require us to sell a higher volume of sales and services, and may have a negative effect upon our gross profit margins. THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN OUR STOCK PRICE. The market for our common stock has a limited daily trading volume, and therefore even moderate selling pressure could have a depressive effect on our stock price. Price volatility may continue. The stock price is affected by revenue, earning results, and general economic conditions. 8
