ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS REPORT, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US, THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL OR THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FACED BY OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY OR BUSINESS IN GENERAL, SUCH AS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS, MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE MAY BE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN OUR MANAGEMENT AND OUR NON-MANAGEMENT STOCKHOLDERS. Conflicts of interest create the risk that management may have an incentive to act adversely to the interests of other investors. Our officers may be entitled to receive compensation from a target company they identify or provide services to in connection with a business combination. A conflict of interest may arise between our management’s personal pecuniary interest and their fiduciary duty to our stockholders. Further, our management’s own pecuniary interest may at some point compromise their fiduciary duty to our stockholders. In addition, Mr. Kling, our president and sole director, and Mr. Warshaw, our chief financial officer, are currently involved with other blank check offerings and conflicts in the pursuit of business combinations with such other blank check companies with which they and affiliates of our majority stockholder are, and may in the future be affiliated with, may arise. If we and the other blank check companies that our officers and directors are affiliated with desire to take advantage of the same opportunity, then those officers and directors that are affiliated with both companies would abstain from voting upon the opportunity. Further, Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, a registered broker-dealer and affiliate of our majority stockholder (“Rodman & Renshaw”), may act as investment banker, placement agent or financial consultant to us in connection with a potential business combination transaction and may receive a fee and/or securities for such services. We cannot assure you that conflicts of interest among us, our management, Rodman & Renshaw and our stockholders will not develop. OUR BUSINESS IS DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE BECAUSE WE HAVE NO OPERATING HISTORY. As the Company has no operating history or revenue and only minimal assets, there is a risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern and consummate a business combination. The Company has had no recent operating history nor any revenues or earnings from operations since inception. We have no significant assets or financial resources. We will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a business combination. This may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until we can consummate a business combination with a profitable business opportunity. We cannot assure you that we can identify a suitable business opportunity and consummate a business combination. THERE IS COMPETITION FOR THOSE PRIVATE COMPANIES SUITABLE FOR A MERGER TRANSACTION OF THE TYPE CONTEMPLATED BY MANAGEMENT. We are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We will be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination. 6 FUTURE SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF MANAGEMENT TO LOCATE AND ATTRACT A SUITABLE ACQUISITION. The nature of our operations is highly speculative and there is a consequent risk of loss of your investment. The success of our plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations, financial condition and management of an identified business opportunity. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating candidates with established operating histories. In the event we complete a business combination with a privately held company, the success of our operations may be dependent upon management of the successor firm or venture partner firm and numerous other factors beyond our control. MANAGEMENT INTENDS TO DEVOTE ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO SEEKING A TARGET COMPANY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY A SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATE AND CONSUMMATE A BUSINESS COMBINATION. While seeking a business combination, management anticipates devoting no more than a few hours per month to the Company's affairs. Our officers have not entered into written employment agreements with us and are not expected to do so in the foreseeable future. This limited commitment may adversely impact our ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination. THE TIME AND COST OF PREPARING A PRIVATE COMPANY TO BECOME A PUBLIC REPORTING COMPANY MAY PRECLUDE US FROM ENTERING INTO AND CONSUMMATING A MERGER OR ACQUISITION WITH THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PRIVATE COMPANIES. Target companies that fail to comply with SEC reporting requirements may delay or preclude business acquisitions. Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act require reporting companies to provide certain information about significant acquisitions, including certified financial statements for the company acquired, covering one, two, or three years, depending on the relative size of the acquisition. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare these statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an acquisition. Otherwise suitable acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may be inappropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable. THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATION WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. Although we will be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, management believes we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), since we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. If we engage in business combinations which result in our holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. If so, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the Securities and Exchange Commission as to our status under the Investment Company Act and, consequently, violation of the Investment Company Act could subject us to material adverse consequences. ANY POTENTIAL ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH A FOREIGN COMPANY MAY SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS. If we enter into a business combination with a foreign concern, we will be subject to risks inherent in business operations outside of the United States. These risks include, for example, currency fluctuations, regulatory problems, punitive tariffs, unstable local tax policies, trade embargoes, risks related to shipment of raw materials and finished goods across national borders and cultural and language differences. Foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States economy in growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, market development, rate of savings, capital investment, resource self-sufficiency balance of payments positions, and in other respect. 7 OUR BUSINESS WILL HAVE NO REVENUES UNLESS AND UNTIL WE MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE AN OPERATING BUSINESS. We are a development stage company and have had no revenues from operations. We may not realize any revenues unless and until we successfully merge with or acquire an operating business. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO ISSUE MORE SHARES IN A MERGER OR ACQUISITION, WHICH WILL RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of a maximum of 75,000,000 shares of common stock and a maximum of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Any merger or acquisition effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing stockholders. Moreover, the common stock issued in any such merger or acquisition transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non-arm’s-length basis by our management, resulting in an additional reduction in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. To the extent that additional shares of common stock or preferred stock are issued in connection with a business combination or otherwise, dilution to the interests of our stockholders will occur and the rights of the holders of common stock might be materially adversely affected. OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY ENGAGE IN A TRANSACTION TO CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. In order to provide an interest in the Company to a third party, our stockholders may choose to cause the Company to sell Company securities to third parties, with the proceeds of such sale being utilized by the Company to repurchase shares of common stock held by the stockholders. As a result of such transaction, our management, principal stockholders and Board of Directors may change. THE COMPANY HAS CONDUCTED LIMITED MARKET RESEARCH OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY A BUSINESS TO MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE. The Company has conducted limited market research concerning prospective business opportunities. Therefore, we have no assurances that market demand exists for a merger or acquisition as contemplated by us. It may be expected that any such target business or transaction will present such a level of risk that conventional private or public offerings of securities or conventional bank financing will not be available. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire a business opportunity on terms favorable to us. Decisions as to which business opportunity to participate in will be unilaterally made by our management, which may act without the consent, vote or approval of our stockholders. BECAUSE WE MAY SEEK TO COMPLETE A BUSINESS COMBINATION THROUGH A “REVERSE MERGER”, FOLLOWING SUCH A TRANSACTION WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF MAJOR BROKERAGE FIRMS. Additional risks may exist since we will assist a privately held business to become public through a “reverse merger.” Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our Company since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our post-merger company in the future. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT FOLLOWING A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH AN OPERATING BUSINESS, OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE LISTED ON NASDAQ OR ANY OTHER SECURITIES EXCHANGE. 8 Following a business combination, we may seek the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ or the NYSE. However, we cannot assure you that following such a transaction, we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of either of those or any other stock exchange, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on either of those or any other stock exchange. After completing a business combination, until our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ or another stock exchange, we expect that our common stock would be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, another over-the-counter quotation system, or on the “pink sheets,” where our stockholders may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. In addition, we would be subject to an SEC rule that, if it failed to meet the criteria set forth in such rule, imposes various practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such rule may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect its liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital following a business combination. THERE IS NO PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, NOR HAVE WE EVER PAID DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. There is no public trading market for our common stock and none is expected to develop in the foreseeable future unless and until the Company completes a business combination with an operating business and such business files a registration statement under the Securities Act. Additionally, we have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not presently intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that any funds available for payment of dividends will be re-invested into the Company to further its business strategy. AUTHORIZATION OF PREFERRED STOCK. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by its Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our authorized preferred stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future. CONTROL BY EXISTING STOCKHOLDER. R&R Investments VI, LLC beneficially owns 80% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, this stockholder is able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, and the approval of mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
