Risk factors There are known and unknown risks and uncertainties relating to Smith & Nephews business. The factors listed below could cause the Groups business, financial position and results of operations to differ materially and adversely from expected and historical levels. In addition, other factors not listed here that Smith & Nephew cannot presently identify or does not believe to be equally significant could also materially adversely affect Smith & Nephews business, financial position or results of operations. Highly competitive markets The Groups business segments compete across a diverse range of geographic and product markets. Each market in which the business segments operate contains a number of different competitors, including specialised and international corporations. Significant product innovations, technical advances or the intensification of price competition by competitors could adversely affect the Groups operating results. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than Smith & Nephew. These competitors may be able to initiate technological advances in the field, deliver products on more attractive terms, more aggressively market their products or invest larger amounts of capital and research and development into their businesses. There is a possibility of further consolidation of competitors, which could adversely affect the Groups ability to compete with larger companies due to insufficient financial resources. If any of the Groups businesses were to lose market share or achieve lower than expected sales growth, there could be a disproportionate adverse impact on the Groups share price and its strategic options. Competition exists among healthcare providers to gain patients on the basis of quality, service and price. There has been some consolidation in the Groups customer base and this trend is expected to continue. Increased competition and unanticipated actions by competitors or customers could lead to downward pressure on prices and/or a decline in market share in any of the Groups business areas, which could adversely affect Smith & Nephews results of operations and hinder its growth potential. Continual development and introduction of new products The medical devices industry has a rapid rate of new product introduction. In order to remain competitive, each of the Groups business segments must continue to develop innovative products that satisfy customer needs and preferences or provide cost or other advantages. Developing new products is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. A potential product may not be brought to market or not succeed in the market for any number of reasons, including failure to work optimally, failure to receive regulatory approval, failure to be cost-competitive, infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights and changes in consumer demand. The Groups products and technologies are also subject to marketing attack by competitors. Furthermore, new products that are developed and marketed by the Groups competitors may affect price levels in the various markets in which the Groups business segments operate. If the Groups new products do not remain competitive with those of competitors, the Groups revenue could decline. The Group maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. Marketplace changes resulting from the introduction of new products or surgical procedures may cause some of the Groups products to become obsolete. The Group makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilisation dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favourable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Dependence on government and other funding In most established markets throughout the world, expenditure on medical devices is ultimately controlled to a large extent by governments. Funds may be made available or withdrawn from healthcare budgets depending on government policy. The Group is therefore largely dependent on future governments providing increased funds commensurate with the increased demand arising from demographic trends. Pricing of the Groups products is largely governed in most established markets by governmental reimbursement authorities. Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, excise taxes and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Group has operations. This control may be exercised by determining prices for an individual product or for an entire procedure. The Group is exposed to changes in reimbursement policy, tax policy and pricing which may have an adverse impact on sales and operating profit. In particular, changes to the healthcare legislation in the US are due to impose significant taxes on medical device manufacturers from 2013. There may be an increased risk of adverse changes to government funding policies arising from the deterioration in macro-economic conditions in some of the Groups markets. The Group must adhere to the rules laid down by government agencies that fund or regulate healthcare, including extensive and complex rules in the US. Failure to do so could result in fines or loss of future funding. World economic conditions Demand for the Groups products is driven by demographic trends, including the ageing population and the incidence of osteoporosis and obesity. Supply of, use of and payment for the Groups products are also influenced by world economic conditions which could place increased pressure on demand and pricing, adversely impacting the Groups ability to deliver revenue and margin growth. The conditions could favour larger, better capitalised groups, with higher market shares and margins. As a consequence, the Groups prosperity is linked to general economic conditions and there is a risk of deterioration of the Groups performance and finances during adverse macro-economic conditions. During 2012, economic conditions worldwide continued to create several challenges for the Group, including deferrals of joint replacement procedures, heightened pricing pressure, significant declines in capital equipment expenditures at hospitals and increased uncertainty over the collectability of European government debt, particularly those in certain parts of southern Europe. These factors tempered the overall growth of the Groups global markets and could have an increased impact on growth in the future. Table of Contents Section 7 Accounts and other information 147 Political uncertainties The Group operates on a worldwide basis and has distribution channels, purchasing agents and buying entities in over 90 countries. Political upheaval in some of those countries or in surrounding regions may impact the Groups results of operations. Political changes in a country could prevent the Group from receiving remittances of profit from a member of the Group located in that country or from selling its products or investments in that country. Furthermore, changes in government policy regarding import quotas, taxation or other matters could adversely affect the Groups turnover and operating profit. War, terrorist activities or other conflict could also adversely impact the Group. Currency fluctuations Smith & Nephews results of operations are affected by transactional exchange rate movements in that they are subject to exposures arising from revenue in a currency different from the related costs and expenses. The Groups manufacturing cost base is situated principally in the US, the UK, China and Switzerland, from which finished products are exported to the Groups selling operations worldwide. Thus, the Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the US Dollar, Sterling and Swiss Franc and the currency of the Groups selling operations, particularly the Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. If the US Dollar, Sterling or Swiss Franc should strengthen against the Euro, Australian Dollar and the Japanese Yen, the Groups trading margin could be adversely affected. The Group manages the impact of exchange rate movements on sales and cost of goods sold by a policy of transacting forward foreign currency commitments when firm purchase orders are placed. In addition, the Groups policy is for forecast transactions to be covered between 50% and 90% for up to one year. The Group uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency and the US Dollar is the functional currency of Smith & Nephew plc. The Groups revenues, profits and earnings are also affected by exchange rate movements on the translation of results of operations in foreign subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes. See Financial position, liquidity and capital resources on page 50. Manufacturing and supply The Groups manufacturing production is concentrated at 12 main facilities in Memphis, Mansfield and Oklahoma City in the US, Hull, Warwick and Gilberdyke in the UK, Aarau in Switzerland, Tuttlingen in Germany, Fort Saskatchewan and Calgary in Canada and Suzhou and Beijing in China. If major physical disruption took place at any of these sites, it could adversely affect the results of operations. Physical loss and consequential loss insurance is carried to cover such risks but is subject to limits and deductibles and may not be sufficient to cover catastrophic loss. Management of orthopaedic inventory is complex, particularly forecasting and production planning. There is a risk that failures in operational execution could lead to excess inventory or individual product shortages. Each of the business segments is reliant on certain key suppliers of raw materials, components, finished products and packaging materials. These suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to the Groups standard of quality requirements. If any of these suppliers is unable to meet the Groups needs, compromises on standards of quality or substantially increases its prices, Smith & Nephew would need to seek alternative suppliers. There can be no assurance that alternative suppliers would provide the necessary raw materials on favourable or cost-effective terms at the desired quality. Consequently, the Group may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain raw materials, which it may not be able to pass on to its customers in the form of increased prices for its finished products. In addition, some of the raw materials used may become unavailable, and there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to obtain suitable and cost-effective substitutes. Any interruption of supply caused by these or other factors could negatively impact Smith & Nephews revenue and operating profit. The Group uses a variety of information systems to conduct its manufacturing, supply and selling operations. An unrecoverable fault in one of these systems could disrupt trading in certain markets and locations. The Group is in the process of outsourcing to third parties or relocating to lower cost countries certain of its manufacturing and other processes. As a result of these transfers, there is a risk of disruption to supply. Attracting and retaining key personnel The Groups continued development depends on its ability to hire and retain highly-skilled personnel with particular expertise. This is critical, particularly in general management, research, new product development and in the sales forces. If Smith & Nephew is unable to retain key personnel in general management, research and new product development or if its largest sales forces suffer disruption or upheaval, its sales and operating profit would be adversely affected. Additionally, if the Group is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive workforce, it may not be able to meet its strategic business objectives. Proprietary rights and patents Due to the technological nature of medical devices and the Groups emphasis on serving its customers with innovative products, the Group has been subject to patent infringement claims and is subject to the potential for additional claims. Claims asserted by third parties regarding infringement of their intellectual property rights, if successful, could require the Group to expend time and significant resources to pay damages, develop non-infringing products or obtain licences to the products which are the subject of such litigation, thereby affecting the Groups growth and profitability. Smith & Nephew attempts to protect its intellectual property and regularly opposes third party patents and trademarks where appropriate in those areas that might conflict with the Groups business interests. If Smith & Nephew fails to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights successfully, its competitive position could suffer, which could harm its results of operations. Product liability claims and loss of reputation The development, manufacture and sale of medical devices entail risk of product liability claims or recalls. Design and manufacturing defects with respect to products sold by the Group or by companies it has acquired could damage, or impair the repair of, body functions. The Group may become subject to liability, which could be substantial, because of actual or alleged defects in its products. In addition, product defects could lead to the need to recall from the market existing products, which may be costly and harmful to the Groups reputation. There can be no assurance that customers, particularly in the US, the Groups largest geographical market, will not bring product liability or related claims that would have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position or results of operations in the future, or that the Group will be able to resolve such claims within insurance limits. Table of Contents 148 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2012 Group information continued Regulatory standards and compliance in the healthcare industry Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation and review by various government authorities. In general, the trend in many countries in which the Group does business is towards higher expectations and increased enforcement activity by governmental authorities. While the Group is committed to doing business with integrity and welcomes the trend to higher standards in the healthcare industry, the Group and other companies in the industry have been subject to investigations and other enforcement activity that have incurred and may continue to incur significant expense. See Legal proceedings on page 52. Under certain circumstances, if the Group were found to have violated the law, its ability to sell its products to certain customers could be restricted. Regulatory approval The international medical device industry is highly regulated. Regulatory requirements are a major factor in determining whether substances and materials can be developed into marketable products and the amount of time and expense that should be allotted to such development. National regulatory authorities administer and enforce a complex series of laws and regulations that govern the design, development, approval, manufacture, labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare products. They also review data supporting the safety and efficacy of such products. Of particular importance is the requirement in many countries that products be authorised or registered prior to manufacture, marketing or sale and that such authorisation or registration be subsequently maintained. The major regulatory agencies for Smith & Nephews products include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan and the State Food and Drug Administration in China. At any time, the Group is awaiting a number of regulatory approvals which, if not received, could adversely affect results of operations. The trend is towards more stringent regulation and higher standards of technical appraisal. Such controls have become increasingly demanding to comply with and management believes that this trend will continue. Regulatory requirements may also entail inspections for compliance with appropriate standards, including those relating to Quality Management Systems or Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. All manufacturing and other significant facilities within the Group are subject to regular internal and external audit for compliance with national and Group medical device regulation and policies. Payment for medical devices may be governed by reimbursement tariff agencies in a number of countries. Reimbursement rates may be set in response to perceived economic value of the devices, based on clinical and other data relating to cost, patient outcomes and comparative effectiveness. They may also be affected by overall government budgetary considerations. The Group believes that its emphasis on innovative products and services should contribute to success in this environment. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could have a number of adverse consequences, including withdrawal of approval to sell a product in a country, temporary closure of a manufacturing facility, fines and potential damage to company reputation. Failure to make successful acquisitions A key element of the Groups strategy for continued growth is to make acquisitions or alliances to complement its existing business. Failure to identify appropriate acquisition targets or failure to conduct adequate due diligence or to integrate them successfully would have an adverse impact on the Groups competitive position and profitability. This could result from the diversion of management resources towards the acquisition or integration process, challenges of integrating organisations of different geographic, cultural and ethical backgrounds, as well as the prospect of taking on unexpected or unknown liabilities. In addition, the availability of global capital may make financing less attainable or more expensive and could result in the Group failing in its strategic aim of growth by acquisition or alliance. Other risk factors Smith & Nephew is subject to a number of other risks, which are common to most global medical technology groups and are reviewed as part of the Groups risk management process. Table of Contents Section 7 Accounts and other information 149 Dividends Dividend history Smith & Nephew has paid dividends on its Ordinary Shares in every year since 1937. Following the capital restructuring and dividend reduction in 2000 the Group adopted a policy of increasing its dividend cover (the ratio of EPSA, as set out in the Selected financial data, to ordinary dividends declared for the year). This was intended to increase the financing capability of the Group for acquisitions and other investments. From 2000 to 2004 the dividend increased in line with inflation and, in 2004, dividend cover stood at 4.1 times. Having achieved this level of dividend cover the Board changed its policy, from that of increasing dividends in line with inflation, to that of increasing dividends for 2005 and after by 10%. Following the redenomination of the Companys share capital into US Dollars the Board re-affirmed its policy of increasing the dividend by 10% a year in US Dollar terms. On 2 August 2012, the Board announced its intention to pursue a progressive dividend policy, with the aim of increasing the US Dollar value of Ordinary dividends over time broadly based on the Groups underlying growth in earnings, while taking into account capital requirements and cash flows. From 2013, the Board will review at the time of the full year results, the appropriate level of total annual dividend each year. The Board intends that the interim dividend will be set by a formula and will be equivalent to 40% of the total dividend for the previous year. Dividends will continue to be declared in US Dollars with an equivalent amount in sterling payable to those shareholders whose registered address is in the UK, or who have validly elected to receive sterling dividends. An interim dividend in respect of each fiscal year is normally declared in August and paid in November. A final dividend will be recommended by the Board of Directors and paid subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting. Future dividends of Smith & Nephew will be dependent upon: future earnings; the future financial condition of the Group; the Boards dividend policy; and the additional factors that might affect the business of the Group set out in Special note regarding forward-looking statements and Risk Factors.

All dividends, up to the second interim dividend for 2005, were declared in pence per Ordinary Share and translated into US cents per Ordinary Share at the Noon Buying Rate on the payment date. Since the second interim dividend for 2005 all dividends have been declared in US cents per Ordinary Share. The 2012 final dividend will be payable on 8 May 2013, subject to shareholder approval. In respect of the proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2012 of 16.20 US cents per Ordinary Share, the record date will be 19 April 2013 and the payment date will be 8 May 2013. The sterling equivalent per Ordinary Share will be set following the record date. Shareholders may elect to receive their dividend in either sterling or US Dollars and the last day for election will be 19 April 2013. The Ordinary Shares will trade ex-dividend on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges from 17 April 2013.

Table of Contents Section 7 Accounts and other information 153 Share capital The principal trading market for the Ordinary Shares is the London Stock Exchange. The Ordinary Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs. Each ADS represents five Ordinary Shares. The ADS facility is sponsored by The Bank of New York Mellon acting as depositary. All the Ordinary Shares, including those held by Directors and Executive Officers, rank pari passu with each other. On 23 January 2006 the Ordinary Shares of 12 2/9 pence were redenominated as Ordinary Shares of US 20 cents (following approval by shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting in December 2005). The new US Dollar Ordinary Shares carry the same rights as the previous Ordinary Shares. The share price continues to be quoted in sterling and the ADSs continue to represent five Ordinary Shares. In 2006 the Company issued £50,000 of shares in sterling in order to comply with English law. These were issued as Deferred Shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange. They have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value. These shares were allotted to the Chief Executive Officer, although the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish. As at 19 February 2013, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 19,122 registered holders of Ordinary Shares, of whom 86 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of 183,774 Ordinary Shares (less than 0.2% of the total issued). Because certain Ordinary Shares are registered in the names of nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the US is not representative of the number of beneficial owners of Ordinary Shares resident in the US. Shareholdings As at 19 February 2013, 6,478,972 ADSs equivalent to 32,394,860 Ordinary Shares or approximately 3.6% of the total Ordinary Shares in issue, were outstanding and were held by 84 registered holders. Major shareholders As far as is known to Smith & Nephew, the Group is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by any government and the Group has not entered into arrangements, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Group. As at 19 February 2013, no persons are known to Smith & Nephew to have any interest (as defined in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FSA) in 3% or more of the Ordinary Shares, other than as shown below. The following tables show changes over the last three years in the percentage and numbers of the issued share capital owned by shareholders holding 3% or more of Ordinary Shares, as notified to the Company under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules: As at 31 December 19 February 2013% 2012 % 2011 % 2010 % Invesco 11.6 11.9 5.0  BlackRock, Inc. 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 Newton Investment Management Limited 0.9 4.9 5.0 5.0 Legal and General Group plc 3.1 3.0 4.0 5.0 Capital Group of Companies Inc.   0.7 5.1 Thornburg Investment Management Inc.    4.1 As at 31 December 19 February 2013000 2012 000 2011 000 2010 000 Invesco 105,165 107,823 44,901  BlackRock, Inc. 44,811 44,811 44,811 44,322 Newton Investment Management Limited 8,196 8,432 44,337 44,735 Legal and General Group plc 28,331 26,906 35,676 44,704 Capital Group of Companies Inc.   6,138 44,594 Thornburg Investment Management Inc.    36,164 In addition to the above, the Company is aware that Walter Scott & Partners Limited held approximately 39m Ordinary Shares (4.3%) at 19 February 2013. The Company is not aware of any person who has a significant direct or indirect holding of securities in the Company, and is not aware of any persons holding securities which may control the Company. There are no securities in issue which have special rights as to the control of the Company. Table of Contents 154 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2012 Share capital continued Purchase of Ordinary Shares on behalf of the Company The share buy-back programme was suspended in November 2008, in light of conditions in the financial markets. The programme is kept under review. The Company will seek a renewal of its permission from shareholders to purchase up to 10% of its own shares at the AGM on 11 April 2013. As at 31 December 2012, 68,240,200 (2011  68,240,200) Ordinary Shares had been purchased under the share buy-back programme that commenced in February 2007. No shares were purchased in the years between 2009 to 2012. Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders There are no UK governmental laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the export or import of capital or that affect the payment of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Smith & Nephews securities, except for certain restrictions imposed from time to time by Her Majestys Treasury of the United Kingdom pursuant to legislation, such as the United Nations Act 1946 and the Emergency Laws Act 1964, against the government or residents of certain countries. There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the articles of association of Smith & Nephew, restricting the right of non-UK residents to hold or to exercise voting rights in respect of Ordinary Shares, except that where any overseas shareholder has not provided to the Company a UK address for the service of notices, the Company is under no obligation to send any notice or other document to an overseas address. It is, however, the current practice of the Company to send every notice or other document to all shareholders regardless of the country recorded in the register of members, with the exception of details of the Companys dividend re-investment plan, which are not sent to shareholders with recorded addresses in the US and Canada. Taxation information for shareholders The comments below are of a general and summary nature and are based on the Groups understanding of certain aspects of current UK and US federal income tax law and practice relevant to the ADSs and Ordinary Shares not in ADS form. The comments address the material US and UK tax consequences generally applicable to a person who is the beneficial owner of ADSs or Ordinary Shares and who, for US federal income tax purposes, is a citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, or an estate or trust the income of which is included in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source (each a US Holder). The comments set out below do not purport to address all tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares which may be material to a particular holder and in particular do not deal with the position of shareholders who directly or indirectly own 10% or more of the Companys issued Ordinary Shares. This discussion does not apply to (i) persons whose holding of ADSs or Ordinary Shares is effectively connected with or pertains to either a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom through which a US Holder carries on a business in the United Kingdom or a fixed base from which a US Holder performs independent personal services in the United Kingdom, or (ii) persons whose registered address is inside the UK. This discussion does not apply to certain investors subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect to mark to market, partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, US Holders holding ADSs or Ordinary Shares as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction or whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is other than the US Dollar and US Holders liable for alternative minimum tax. In addition, the comments below do not address US state, local or non-US (other than UK) taxes. The summary deals only with US Holders who hold ADSs or Ordinary Shares as capital assets. The summary is based on current UK and US law and practice which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. US Holders are recommended to consult their own tax advisers as to the particular tax consequences to them of the ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares. The Company believes, and this discussion assumes, that the Company was not a passive foreign investment company for its taxable year ended 31 December 2012. This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of US federal income tax law, US Holders of ADSs will generally be treated as owners of the Ordinary Shares represented by the ADSs. However, the US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom depositary shares are released before shares are delivered to the depositary (pre-released) may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by owners of depositary shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders. Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders of ADSs could be affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADSs are pre-released. Table of Contents Section 7 Accounts and other information 155 Taxation of dividends in the United Kingdom and the United States The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK corporation, such as the Company. Distributions paid by the Company will be treated for US federal income tax purposes as foreign source ordinary dividend income to a US Holder to the extent paid out of the Companys current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for US federal income tax purposes. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate US Holders. Dividends paid to certain non-corporate US Holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs may be subject to US federal income tax at lower rates than other types of ordinary income if certain conditions are met. Non-corporate US Holders should consult their own tax advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at these favourable rates. Taxation of capital gains US Holders, who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the UK, will not generally be liable for UK capital gains tax on any capital gain realised upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares unless the ADSs or Ordinary Shares are held in connection with a trade carried on in the UK through a permanent establishment (or in the case of individuals, through a branch or agency). Furthermore, UK resident individuals who acquire ADSs or Ordinary Shares before becoming temporarily non-UK residents may remain subject to UK taxation of capital gains on gains realised while non-resident. For US federal income tax purposes, gains or losses realised upon a taxable sale or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares by US Holders generally will be US source capital gains or losses and will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADSs or Ordinary Shares were held for more than one year. The amount of a US Holders gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realised on the sale or other disposition and such holders tax basis in the ADSs, or Ordinary Shares, determined in US Dollars. Inheritance and estate taxes The HM Revenue & Customs imposes inheritance tax on capital transfers which occur on death, and in the seven years preceding death. The HM Revenue & Customs considers that the US/UK Double Taxation Convention on Estate and Gift Tax applies to inheritance tax. Consequently, a US citizen who is domiciled in the United States and is not a UK national or domiciled in the United Kingdom will not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares. A UK national who is domiciled in the United States will be subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal estate tax but will be entitled to a credit for US federal estate tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing the liability to UK inheritance tax. Conversely, a US citizen who is domiciled or deemed domiciled in the United Kingdom will be entitled to a credit for UK inheritance tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing the liability for US federal estate tax. Special rules apply where ADSs and Ordinary Shares are business property of a permanent establishment of an enterprise situated in the United Kingdom. US information reporting and backup withholding A US Holder may be subject to US information reporting and backup withholding on dividends paid on or the proceeds of sales of ADSs or Ordinary Shares made within the US or through certain US-related financial intermediaries, unless the US Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, provides a correct US taxpayer identification number and certain other conditions are met. US backup withholding may apply if there has been a notification from the US Internal Revenue Service of a failure to report all interest or dividends. Any backup withholding deducted may be credited against the US Holders US federal income tax liability, and, where the backup withholding exceeds the actual liability, the US Holder may obtain a refund by timely filing the appropriate refund claim with the US Internal Revenue Service. Certain US Holders who are individuals (and under proposed Treasury regulations, certain entities) may be required to report information relating to securities issued by a non-US person (or foreign accounts through which the securities are held), subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for securities held in accounts maintained by US financial institutions). US Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADSs. UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax UK stamp duty is charged on documents and in particular instruments for the transfer of registered ownership of Ordinary Shares. Transfers of Ordinary Shares in certificated form will generally be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of 1⁄2% of the consideration given for the transfer with the duty rounded up to the nearest £5. UK stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) arises when there is an agreement to transfer shares in UK companies for consideration in money or moneys worth, and so an agreement to transfer Ordinary Shares for money or other consideration may give rise to a charge to SDRT at the rate of 1⁄2% (rounded up to the nearest penny). The charge of SDRT will be cancelled, and any SDRT already paid will be refunded, if within six years of the agreement an instrument of transfer is produced to HM Revenue & Customs and the appropriate stamp duty paid. Transfers of Ordinary Shares into CREST (an electronic transfer system) are exempt from stamp duty so long as the transferee is a member of CREST who will hold the Ordinary Shares as a nominee for the transferor and the transfer is in a form that will ensure that the securities become held in uncertificated form within CREST. Paperless transfers of Ordinary Shares within CREST for consideration in money or moneys worth are liable to SDRT rather than stamp duty. SDRT on relevant transactions will be collected by CREST at 1⁄2%, and this will apply whether or not the transfer is affected in the United Kingdom and whether or not the parties to it are resident or situated in the United Kingdom. United Kingdom A charge of stamp duty or SDRT at the rates of 1 1⁄2% of the consideration (or, in some circumstances, the value of the shares concerned) will arise on a transfer or issue of Ordinary Shares to the Depositary or to certain persons providing a clearance service (or their nominees or agents) for the conversion into ADRs and will generally be payable by the Depositary or person providing clearance service. In accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable by the Depositary on deposits of Ordinary Shares will be charged by the Depositary to the party to whom ADRs are delivered against such deposits. No liability for stamp duty or SDRT will arise on any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS, provided that the ADS and any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remains at all times outside the United Kingdom, and provided further that any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the United Kingdom and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the United Kingdom (the location of the custodian as a holder of Ordinary Shares not being relevant in this context). In any other case, any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS could, depending on all the circumstances of the transfer, give rise to a charge to stamp duty or SDRT.

Table of Contents 158 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2012 Articles of association The following summarises certain material rights of holders of the Companys Ordinary Shares under the material provisions of the Companys articles of association and English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companies Act and the Companys articles of association. In the following description, a shareholder is the person registered in the Companys register of members as the holder of an Ordinary Share. The Company is incorporated under the name Smith & Nephew plc and is registered in England and Wales with registered number 324357. The Companys Ordinary Shares may be held in certificated or uncertificated form. No holder of the Companys shares will be required to make additional contributions of capital in respect of the Companys shares in the future. In accordance with English law the Companys Ordinary Shares rank equally. Directors Under the Companys articles of association, a Director may not vote in respect of any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal in which he, or any person connected with him, has any material interest other than by virtue of his interests in securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company. This is subject to certain exceptions relating to proposals (a) indemnifying him in respect of obligations incurred on behalf of the Company, (b) indemnifying a third party in respect of obligations of the Company for which the Director has assumed responsibility under an indemnity or guarantee, (c) relating to an offer of securities in which he will be interested as an underwriter, (d) concerning another body corporate in which the Director is beneficially interested in less than 1% of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body corporate, (e) relating to an employee benefit in which the Director will share equally with other employees and (f) relating to any insurance that the Company is empowered to purchase for the benefit of Directors of the Company in respect of actions undertaken as Directors (and/or officers) of the Company. A Director shall not vote or be counted in any quorum present at a meeting in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote. The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all monies borrowed after deducting cash and current asset investments by the Company and its subsidiaries shall not exceed the sum of $6,500,000,000. Any Director who has been appointed by the Directors since the previous Annual General Meeting of shareholders, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director holds office only until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and then shall be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. The other Directors retire and are eligible for re-appointment at the third Annual General Meeting after the meeting at which they were last re-appointed. If not re-appointed a Director retiring at a meeting shall retain office until the meeting appoints someone in his place, or if it does not do so, until the conclusion of the meeting. The Directors are subject to removal with or without cause by the Board or the shareholders. Directors are not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification. Under the Companys articles of association and English law, a Director may be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against liabilities he may sustain or incur in the execution of his duties. Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares Under English law, dividends are payable on the Companys Ordinary Shares only out of profits available for distribution, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and by the Companies Act 2006. Holders of the Companys Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive final dividends as may be declared by the Directors and approved by the shareholders in general meeting, rateable according to the amounts paid up on such shares, provided that the dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Directors. The Companys Board of Directors may declare such interim dividends as appear to them to be justified by the Companys financial position. If authorised by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders, the Board may also direct payment of a dividend in whole or in part by the distribution of specific assets (and in particular of paid up shares or debentures of the Company). Any dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and will revert to the Company. There were no material modifications to the rights of shareholders under the Articles during 2012. Voting rights of Ordinary Shares Voting at any general meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll, which is a written vote, is duly demanded and held. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for each Ordinary Share held by that shareholder. A poll may be demanded by any of the following:  the chairman of the meeting;  at least five shareholders present or by proxy entitled to vote on the resolution;  any shareholder or shareholders representing in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution; or  any shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote on the resolution on which there have been paid-up sums in aggregate equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right. A form of proxy will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one, as above. The necessary quorum for a general meeting is two shareholders present in person or by proxy carrying the right to vote upon the business to be transacted. Matters are transacted at general meetings of the Company by the processing and passing of resolutions of which there are two kinds; ordinary or special resolutions:  Ordinary resolutions include resolutions for the re-election of Directors, the approval of financial statements, the declaration of dividends (other than interim dividends), the appointment and re-appointment of auditors or the grant of authority to allot shares. An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of those persons voting at the meetings at which there is a quorum.  Special resolutions include resolutions amending the Companys articles of association, dis-applying statutory pre-emption rights or changing the Companys name; modifying the rights of any class of the Companys shares at a meeting of the holders of such class or relating to certain matters concerning the Companys winding up. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the votes of the persons voting at the meeting at which there is a quorum. Annual General Meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of 21 days. Other general meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of at least 14 clear days. The days of delivery or receipt of notice are not included. The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted. Meetings are convened by the Board of Directors. Members with 5% of the Ordinary Share capital of the Company may requisition the Board to convene a meeting. Table of Contents Section 7 Accounts and other information 159 Variation of rights If, at any time, the Companys share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, with the consent in writing of holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or upon the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, all the provisions of the articles of association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum is to be the number of persons (which must be two or more) who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class and at any such meeting a poll may be demanded in writing by any person or their proxy who hold shares of that class. Where a person is present by proxy or proxies, he is treated as holding only the shares in respect of which the proxies are authorised to exercise voting rights. Rights in a winding-up Except as the Companys shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon the Companys winding up, the balance of assets available for distribution:  after the payment of all creditors including certain preferential creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors; and  subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares; is to be distributed among the holders of Ordinary Shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution is generally to be made in US Dollars. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of any extraordinary resolution of the shareholders and any other sanction required by law, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the Companys assets in kind. Limitations on voting and shareholding There are no limitations imposed by English law or the Companys articles of association on the right of non-residents or foreign persons to hold or vote the Companys Ordinary Shares or ADSs, other than the limitations that would generally apply to all of the Companys shareholders. Transfers of shares The Board may refuse to register the transfer of shares held in certificated form which:  are not fully paid (provided that it shall not exercise this discretion in such a way as to prevent stock market dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis);  are not duly stamped or duly certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty, lodged at the Transfer Office or at such other place as the Board may appoint and (save in the case of a transfer by a person to whom no certificate was issued in respect of the shares in question) accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person so to do;  are in respect of more than one class of shares; or  are in favour of more than four transferees. Deferred shares Following the redenomination of share capital on 23 January 2006 the Ordinary Shares nominal value became 20 US cents each. There were no changes to the rights or obligations of the Ordinary Shares. In order to comply with the Companies Act 2006, a new class of sterling shares was created, Deferred Shares, of which £50,000 were issued and allotted in 2006 as fully paid to the Chief Executive Officer though the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish. These Deferred Shares have no voting or dividend rights and on winding up only are entitled to repayment at nominal value only if all Ordinary shareholders have received the nominal value of their shares plus an additional $1,000 each. Amendments The Company does not have any special rules about amendments to its articles of association beyond those imposed by law.
