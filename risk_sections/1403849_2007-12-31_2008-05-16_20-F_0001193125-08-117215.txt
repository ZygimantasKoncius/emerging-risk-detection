D. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company We have a limited operating history and the long-term potential of our online games is unproven, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. We commenced our game development business in 2004 and launched our first MMORPG, Perfect World, in January 2006. We launched four additional MMORPGs, Legend of Martial Arts, Perfect World II, Zhu Xian and Chi Bi, and one online casual game, Hot Dance Party, in September 2006, November 2006, May 2007, January 2008 and March 2008, respectively. As such, we have a limited relevant operating history for you to evaluate our business, financial performance and prospects. We may not be able to achieve similar results or growth in future periods. Accordingly, you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior periods as an indication of our future performance. It is also difficult to evaluate our prospects, because we may not have sufficient experience to address the risks frequently encountered by early stage companies entering new and rapidly evolving markets, including the online game market. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 6 Table of Contents We have adopted an item-based revenue model for most of our games, and we intend to apply this revenue model to most of our new games. This relatively new revenue model may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We have adopted an item-based revenue model for four of our MMORPGs, Legend of Martial Arts, Perfect World II, Zhu Xian and Chi Bi. For our first MMORPG, Perfect World, we use a time-based model whereby players are charged for their playing time. Going forward, we intend to apply the item-based model to most of the new games that we operate. Under the item-based revenue model, players are able to play the online game free of charge for an unlimited amount of time, but are charged for purchases of in-game items, such as performance-enhancing items, clothing, accessories and pets. While several other online game companies have adopted the item-based model, it is still relatively new compared to the more proven time-based model and results in new risks and uncertainties for us and other online game companies. The item-based model will require us to design games that not only attract players to spend more time playing, but also encourage them to purchase in-game items. The sale of in-game items will require us to track even more closely consumer tastes and preferences, especially in-game spending trends. In addition, the item-based model may cause additional concerns with the PRC regulators, who have recently been trying to implement ways to reduce the amount of time that Chinese youths spend on online games. A model that does not charge for time may be viewed by the PRC regulators as inconsistent with this goal. We cannot assure you that the item-based revenue model will be successful, or that it will not have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our revenue recognition policy for the item-based games entails our best estimates of the lives of various items associated with each of our item-based games. As we adopted the item-based revenue model only in September 2006, we have a limited operating history and data for our item-based games on which to base our revenue recognition policy for such games. With respect to permanent ownership items that we sell to players, we recognize revenues over the estimated lives of such items. We consider the average period that players typically play our games and other player behavior patterns to arrive at our best estimates for the lives of these permanent ownership items, which, in some cases, may be as long as the estimated life of the related game. However, given the relatively short operating history of our item-based games, our estimate of the period that players typically play our games may not accurately reflect the actual lives of the items. We have been revising our estimates as we continue to gain operating data, and refine our estimation process and results accordingly. Any future revisions to estimates could adversely affect the time period during which we recognize revenues from these items. For example, an increase in the estimated lives of these items would increase the period over which the revenues from the items are recognized. See Item 5, Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsCritical Accounting PoliciesRevenue Recognition. If we are unable to successfully develop, launch and/or operate additional online games that grow our player base and increase our revenues, our future results of operations will be adversely affected. In order for our business strategy to succeed over time, we will need to continually develop, launch and operate new online games or license or acquire new games that are commercially successful. We will need to do this to both replace our existing online games as they reach the end of their useful economic lives, which we believe are typically two to three years for most online games, and to meet our growth strategy of operating a larger number of online games that grow our overall player base and increase our revenues. We are currently in the process of developing four new MMORPGs. We plan to invest a significant amount of financial and personnel resources in developing, launching and operating these and other new online games in the future. We launched our first online casual game, Hot Dance Party, in March 2008 using an item-based revenue model, but since April 2008, we have offered this game to users free of charge for all in-game items in 7 Table of Contents order to attract more users to play the game. We are still considering when and how to charge users of this game. We cannot assure you that we will charge users of this game in the future or the operation of this game will be a commercial success. The success of our new online games will largely depend on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing consumer tastes and preferences and technological advances in a timely manner. We cannot assure you that the games we develop will be launched as scheduled, viewed by the regulatory authorities as complying with content restrictions, attractive to players, able to compete with games operated by our competitors or commercially successful. In addition, as we introduce new games, some of our existing customers may switch to the new games. If this transfer of players from our existing games does not grow our overall player base and revenues, our growth and profitability may be materially and adversely affected. In the future, we may also license or acquire new games from other game developers. However, we have no track record in operating games licensed or acquired from other developers, and we may not be able to identify appropriate games or enter into arrangements with those developers to offer these games in China, on terms acceptable to us. If we are not able to develop, license or acquire additional online games that are commercially successful and have continuing appeal to players, our future profitability and growth prospects will decline. We face the risks of uncertainties regarding the growth of the online game industry and market acceptance of our online games and in-game items. The online game industry, from which we derive all of our revenues, is a relatively new and evolving industry and concept. The growth of the online game industry and the level of demand and market acceptance of our online games are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Our future operating results will depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include:  the growth of personal computer, Internet and broadband users and penetration in China and other markets in which we offer our games, and the rate of any such growth;  whether the online game industry, particularly in China and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, continues to grow and the rate of any such growth;  general economic conditions, particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending;  the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment, particularly games of console systems, such as those made by Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, which are already popular in developed countries and may gain popularity in China and other countries in which we market our games;  changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;  the popularity and price of new online games and in-game items that we and our competitors launch and distribute; and  our ability to timely upgrade and improve our existing games to extend their life spans and to maintain their competitive positions in the online game market. Our ability to plan for product development and distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by our ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in consumer tastes and preferences. Currently, MMORPGs are popular in China. However, there is no assurance that MMORPGs will continue to be popular in China or elsewhere. A decline in the popularity of online games in general, or the MMORPGs that we operate, will likely adversely affect our business and prospects. We must be able to track and respond to these changes in consumer preferences in a timely and effective manner. Furthermore, given that the item-based revenue model relies on in-game purchases, we must be able to track and respond quickly to changes in game preferences and consumer spending trends. 8 Table of Contents Our business could suffer if we do not successfully manage our current growth and potential future growth. We have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion that has placed, and continues to place, strain on our management personnel, systems and resources. To accommodate our growth pursuant to our strategies, we anticipate that we may need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems, including online payment systems and related security systems, procedures and controls, and the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems, all of which require substantial management efforts. We also will need to continue to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce, and manage our relationships with our distributors, customers, overseas licensees and third-party service providers. All of these endeavors will require substantial management effort and skill and the incurrence of additional expenditures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to efficiently or effectively implement our growth strategies and manage the growth of our operations, and any failure to do so may limit our future growth and hamper our business strategy. We may not be able to maintain our revenues and profitability as we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against many companies. We believe that there are over 100 online game operators in China. Given the relatively low entry barriers to operating online games, we expect more companies to enter the online game industry in China and a wider range of online games to be introduced to the China market. Our principal competitors in China include Shanda Interactive Entertainment Limited, or Shanda, The9 Limited, or The9, Netease.com, Inc., or Netease, Sohu.com Inc., or Sohu, Giant Interactive Group Inc., or Giant Interactive, and Shanghai Everstar Online Entertainment Co. Ltd., or Nineyou. Our potential competitors also include major Internet portal operators, other domestic and foreign game developers and publishers, and alliances between our existing and new competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and name recognition than we have. Some of our competitors or potential competitors, especially major foreign online game developers, have greater game development resources than we have. In addition, many of our competitors have developed and operated games that have proven commercially successful for a longer period of time than our games and have a larger portfolio of MMORPGs and other online game offerings than we do. As a result, they may be able to take greater risks and endure lower than expected performances from some of their games. In addition, our competitors may introduce new business models, and if these new business models are more attractive to customers than the business models we currently use, our customers may switch to our competitors games, and we may lose market share. We believe that competition in the online game market in China may become more intense as increasing numbers of online games are introduced in the market. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any new or existing competitors, or against any new business models implemented by them. In addition, the increased competition we anticipate in the online game industry may also reduce the number of our players or growth rate of our player base, or cause us to reduce usage fees or the prices of certain in-game items. All of these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. We have incurred net losses in the past and may experience net losses or earnings declines in the future. We incurred net losses of RMB6.8 million, RMB29.4 million and RMB27.9 million for the period from inception to December 31, 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. We cannot assure you that we will not incur net losses in the future or that there will not be any earnings or revenue declines in any future periods. Without taking into account share-based compensation expenses, we expect that our total operating expenses will increase as we experience anticipated growth. We incur significant costs and operating expenses to develop, market and operate a game and may not collect revenues in connection therewith for some time or at all. As a result, any decrease or delay in generating more revenues could result in material operating losses and harm our financial condition. 9 Table of Contents As we currently depend on five MMORPGs for substantially all of our revenues, any adverse developments relating to these games may adversely affect our future results of operations. In the first three quarters of 2006, substantially all of our revenues were derived from just one MMORPG, Perfect World, which was launched in January 2006. We launched Legend of Martial Arts, Perfect World II, Zhu Xian and Chi Bi in September 2006, November 2006, May 2007 and January 2008, respectively. We anticipate that these existing games will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues in 2008. Although we are currently developing four new MMORPGs, and will target to develop and launch more games in the future, we cannot guarantee you that we will be able to successfully develop, launch and operate any of these new games. Accordingly, any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations:  failure by us to make quality upgrades, enhancements or improvements to the existing games in a timely manner;  any reduction in or failure to grow the player base of these existing games, any decrease in their popularity in the market due to intensifying competition or other factors;  any decrease in or failure to grow the amount of revenues generated from the existing games; or  any breach of game-related software security, prolonged server interruption due to network failures, hacking activities or other factors or any other adverse developments relating to our games. Our failure to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies could render our game engine, game development platform or games uncompetitive or obsolete, and reduce our revenues and market share. Our proprietary Angelica 3D game engine, game development platform and anti-cheating expertise are critical to our success. The online game industry is subject to rapid technological change. We need to anticipate the emergence of new technologies and assess their market acceptance. We also need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to keep pace with technological advances in order to make our development capabilities and our games competitive in the market. However, development activities are inherently uncertain, and we might encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our development results. Our significant expenditures on research and development may not generate corresponding benefits. Given the fast pace with which online game technology has been and will continue to be developed, we may not be able to timely upgrade our game engine or our game development platform in an efficient and cost-effective manner, or at all. New technologies in online game programming or operations could render our technologies, our existing online games or the games that we are developing or expect to develop in the future obsolete or uncompetitive, thereby potentially resulting in a decline in our revenues and market share. We face risks associated with the licensing of our games overseas, and if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, they could impair our ability to expand our business internationally. As of the date of this report, we have licensed Perfect World II, Legend of Martial Arts and Zhu Xian to game operators in 13, eight and eight countries and regions, respectively. We plan to further license our existing and new games in more countries and regions. The offering of our games in the international markets exposes us to a number of risks, including:  difficulties in identifying and maintaining good relationships with licensees who are knowledgeable about, and can effectively distribute and operate our games in, overseas markets;  difficulties in developing games and expansion packs catering to overseas markets and in renewing our license agreements with licensees upon their expiration;  difficulties in maintaining the reputation of our company and our games, given that our games are operated by licensees in the overseas markets pursuant to their own standards;  difficulties and costs in protecting our intellectual property rights overseas; 10 Table of Contents  difficulties and costs relating to compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas markets in which we offer our games, such as game import regulatory procedures, taxes and other restrictions and expenses;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and  interruptions in cross-border Internet connections or other system failures. Certain countries in Europe are considering banning the distribution of violent games. Korea also requires online game companies to obtain a ratings classification for online games and implement procedures to restrict the distribution of online games to minors. As a result, our international expansion may also be adversely affected by public opinion or government policies overseas. Unauthorized character enhancements and other hacking or cheating activities could harm our business and reputation and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. With the increase in the number of online game players in China, online game operators have increasingly encountered problems arising from the use of unauthorized character enhancements and other hacking or cheating activities. We have from time to time detected a number of players who have gained an unfair in-game advantage by installing hacking or cheating tools to facilitate character progression. In response to these activities, we have installed built-in detection mechanisms in our games to identify various hacking and cheating activities, and have expanded our technical team dedicated to detecting unauthorized character enhancements and resolving other hacking issues. Continued occurrences of unauthorized character enhancements and other manipulations may negatively impact the image of our online games and players perception of their reliability, decrease the number of players, reduce the players interest in purchasing in-game items, shorten the life span of the games and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, once we detect the players who have engaged in hacking or cheating activities, we generally suspend their access to their respective accounts, which may result in significant user dissatisfaction and cause some of these players to cease to play the game altogether. In addition, our games may be affected by other hacking or cheating activities in China and other countries and regions. For example, on June 11 and June 12, 2007, all four online games that we operated in China at that time encountered a large-scale denial of service attack by a third party, which resulted in constraints in our network capacity. Many players could not get access to our servers during that period to play our games. We cannot assure you that we or our overseas licensees will be able to defend against these attacks promptly and effectively in the future. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and eliminate new unauthorized character enhancements or other hacking or cheating activities in a timely manner, or at all. Unauthorized character enhancements and other hacking or cheating activities could harm our business and reputation and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, a constant recurrence of these activities may require us to shift our managements and personnels attention from research and development and other operations to focus instead primarily on anti-hacking programs and activities, which could hurt our ability to develop and launch new games and grow our business. 11 Table of Contents We may not be able to prevent others from infringing upon our intellectual property rights, which may harm our business and expose us to litigation. We regard our proprietary software, domain names, trade names, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual properties as critical to our success. In particular, we have spent significant amounts of time and resources in developing our Angelica 3D game engine and must continue to protect the technology. We do not hold any patents in China or elsewhere, and intellectual property rights and confidentiality protection in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive. We have taken steps to prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary technology, including registration of our existing online games and our Angelica 3D game engine for copyright protection, registration of our domain names and entering into non-competition and confidentiality agreements with our key employees. However, these steps may be inadequate. Any misappropriation by our employees, licensees or other third parties of intellectual property used in our business, whether licensed to us or owned by us, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. In particular, the laws and enforcement procedures of the PRC and certain other countries are uncertain or do not protect intellectual property rights in this area to the same extent as do the laws and enforcement procedures of the United States. We mainly rely on our licensees for copyright, domain names and trademark protection outside China, although very limited protection has been secured to date. We may need to resort to court proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in the future. Litigation relating to our intellectual property might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention away from our business. See Risks Related to Doing Business in ChinaUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. We may be subject to future intellectual property rights claims or other claims which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our financial and management resources away from our business. We cannot assure you that our online games or other content posted on our websites, such as the information posted on our in-game bulletin boards, do not or will not infringe upon patents, valid copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others. For example, in July 2007, a certain China-based online game company claimed that it owned certain trademarks of Chibi in four key categories, including online game and game in China. However, we filed a trademark application for the Chinese name of Chi Bi under Category 41, which includes online game in China in October 2006. According to our trademark search of publicly available sources and our PRC counsels trademark search with the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce in China in July 2007, we were not aware that the Chinese name of Chi Bi had been preliminarily approved as a registered trademark relating to online game under Category 41 in China. We believe that our Chi Bi game and the proposed trademark related to the game do not infringe upon any third partys rights. Some of our employees were previously employed at other companies, including our current and potential competitors. We also intend to hire additional personnel to expand our product development and technical support teams. To the extent these employees are involved in research at our company similar to research in which they have been involved at their former employers, we may become subject to claims that such employees or we may have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers of our employees. In addition, our competitors may file lawsuits against us in order to gain an unfair competitive advantage over us. We may also become subject to claims from our customers from time to time. Although we are not aware of any significant pending or threatened claims, if any such claim arises in the future, litigation or other dispute resolution proceedings may be necessary to retain our ability to offer our current and future games, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our financial and management resources. Furthermore, if we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property rights, incur additional costs to license or develop alternative technologies or games and be forced to pay fines and damages, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 12 Table of Contents Moreover, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if our licensors cannot prevail on future intellectual property rights claims brought against them by third parties. We currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantial revenues and profits from online games based on intellectual property licensed to us exclusively by third parties. See Item 4, Information on the CompanyBusiness Overview Intellectual Property. Any of our licensors may be subject to intellectual property rights claims with respect to those aspects of the online game licensed to us. If any of our licensors cannot prevail on the intellectual property rights claims brought against it, we might lose our license from such licensor and may not be able to obtain the license from the legitimate owner of the intellectual property, and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Undetected programming errors or flaws in our games or failure to maintain effective customer service could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our games, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our games may contain errors or flaws, which may only become apparent after their release, particularly as we launch new games or introduce new features to existing games under tight time constraints. From time to time, our players informed us of programming flaws affecting their game play experience, which we were generally able to resolve promptly. Furthermore, customer service, including in-game masters, is critical for retaining customers, and we may not be able to maintain and continuously improve the quality of our services to meet customers expectations. If our games contain programming errors or other flaws, or if we inadvertently delete our customers records or otherwise fail to provide effective customer service, our customers may be less inclined to continue or resume playing our games or recommend our games to other potential customers, and may switch to our competitors games. Undetected programming errors, game defects and unsatisfactory customer service can disrupt our operations, adversely affect the game experience of our customers, harm our reputation, cause our customers to stop playing our games, and delay market acceptance of our games, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Network interruptions or loss of critical customer data caused by system failures or other internal or external factors may lead to player attrition and revenue reduction and harm our business and reputation. Any failure to maintain the satisfactory performance, reliability, security and availability of our network and computer infrastructure may cause significant harm to our reputation and our ability to attract and maintain players. From time to time, our customers in certain locations could not gain access to our online game services for a period of time lasting from several minutes to several hours, due to server interruptions, power shutdowns, Internet connection problems or other reasons. Any server interruptions, break-downs, design deficiencies, or system failures, including failures which may be attributable to events within or outside our control that could result in a sustained shutdown of all or a material portion of our services or loss of critical customer data, could adversely impact our ability to service our players and lead to player attrition and revenue reduction. Our network systems are also vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer hacking and similar events. We do not maintain insurance policies covering losses relating to our systems and do not have business interruption insurance. If our system and network infrastructure fails to operate effectively, our business may be harmed. We use internally developed software systems that support nearly all aspects of our billing and payment transactions. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to upgrade our systems fast enough to accommodate future traffic levels, avoid obsolescence or successfully integrate any newly developed or acquired technology with our existing systems. Furthermore, our network capacity depends on our owned and leased network servers and the communication bandwidth that we lease. Constraints in network capacity could cause unanticipated system disruptions and slower response times, affecting data transmission and game play. These factors could, among other things, cause us to lose existing or potential customers, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 13 Table of Contents We rely on services from third parties to carry out our businesses, and if there is any interruption or deterioration in the quality of these services, our customers may cease playing our games. We rely on a network of distributors throughout China for sales of our online game services to our customers. As a result, a substantial portion of our sales are carried out via a distribution network composed of non-exclusive third party distributors which also distribute games for our competitors. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our distributors, and cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain favorable relationships with them. In addition, we rely on various Internet data centers to host our servers. Any interruption in our ability to obtain the services of these or other third parties or deterioration in their performance could impair the timeliness and quality of our service. Furthermore, if our arrangements with any of these third parties are terminated or modified against our interest, we may not be able to find alternative channels of distribution or services on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or at all. We could be liable for breaches of security of our website and third party online payment channels, which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. Currently, a portion of our online game operation revenues are generated from sales through third-party online payment platforms. In such transactions, secured transmission of confidential information, such as customers credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information and billing addresses, over public networks, in some cases including our website as well, is essential to maintain consumer confidence. While we have not experienced any breach of our security measures to date, we cannot assure you that our current security measures are adequate. In addition, we expect that an increasing amount of our sales will be conducted over the Internet as a result of the growing use of online payment systems over time. In the meantime, the associated online crime will likely increase as well and we must be prepared to increase our security measures and efforts so that our customers have confidence in the reliability of the online payment systems that we use. We do not have control over the security measures of our third party online payment vendors and we cannot assure you that these vendors security measures are adequate or will be adequate with the expected increased usage of online payment systems. Security breaches of the online payment systems that we use could expose us to litigation and possible liability for failing to secure confidential customer information and could harm our reputation, ability to attract customers and ability to encourage customers to purchase in-game items. We have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Our quarterly operating results have experienced fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, including the demand for our products and services and our competitors products and services, the launch of our new games, changes in estimation of the average period that players typically play our games, the quality of the expansion packs for our existing games, the level of usage of illegal game servers, the level of usage of the Internet, the size and rate of growth of the online game market, development and promotional expenses related to the introduction of new products, network interruptions and other system problems. As an online game operator, our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on the amount of the game playing time spent by our players in that quarter and, in connection with our item-based revenue model, the amount of in-game items purchased, which is influenced by the overall game playing time and price of the items. To a significant degree, our operating expenses are based on planned expenditures and our expectations regarding prospective customer usage and purchases. Failure to meet our expectations or our inability to accurately estimate customer usage and purchases, could disproportionately and adversely affect our operating results in any given quarter. Given the relative newness of our online games and adoption of the item-based model, it may be difficult to estimate customer usage and purchases. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of our future results. 14 Table of Contents Future acquisitions or alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. Selective acquisitions of online game development and operating companies and alliances with key players in the online game industry and other related industry sectors form part of our strategy to further expand our business. For example, in April 2008, we acquired a 20% equity interest in Chengdu Seasky Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd., a developer of MMORPGs. However, our ability to grow through future acquisitions or alliances, such as joint ventures, will depend on the availability of suitable acquisition targets or joint venture partners at reasonable terms, our ability to compete effectively to attract these targets or partners, the availability of financing to complete larger acquisitions or joint ventures, and our ability to obtain any required governmental approvals. Future acquisitions could also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with the assimilation of new operations, technologies and personnel, unforeseen or hidden liabilities, the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions and potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, customers, licensors and other suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain a satisfactory relationship with our joint venture or other partners or handle other risks associated with our future alliances, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We lack experience in identifying, financing or completing large acquisitions or joint venture transactions. Such transactions and the subsequent integration processes would require significant attention from our management. The diversion of our managements attention and any difficulties encountered with respect to the acquisitions or alliances or in the process of integration could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. Our business and growth are substantially dependent on the continuing efforts of our senior executive officers, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services. Our future success depends substantially on the continued services of our senior executive officers and key employees, especially Mr. Michael Yufeng Chi, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Kelvin Wing Kee Lau, our chief financial officer, Mr. Di He, our chief technology officer, Mr. Qing Li, our chief design officer, Mr. Qi Zhu, our senior vice president who is in charge of operations, and Mr. Alan Ming Chen, our senior vice president and chief executive officer of PW USA. We do not maintain key-man life insurance for any of our key executives. If one or more of our executive officers were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we might not be able to replace them easily, timely, or at all. Our business may be severely disrupted and our financial conditions and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If any of our executive officers joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose distributors, customers, service providers, know-how and key professionals and staff members. Each of our executive officers has entered into an employment agreement with us, which contains non-competition provisions. However, if any dispute arises between our executive officers and us, these agreements may not be enforceable in China, where these executive officers reside, in light of the uncertainties with Chinas legal system. See Risks Related to Doing Business in ChinaUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. If we are unable to attract, train and retain key employees, our business may be adversely affected. We will need to hire and retain additional qualified employees, particularly experienced game development personnel with expertise in the online game industry. Since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we may need to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to retain key personnel in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain the qualified key personnel that we will need to achieve our business objectives. In addition, as we are still a relatively young company and our business has grown rapidly since our establishment, at times our ability to train and integrate new employees into our operations may not meet the increasing demands of our business. 15 Table of Contents We will become subject to the management report and auditor attestation report requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of the end of our fiscal year ending December 31, 2008; if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely affected. We are subject to the reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws following our initial public offering in July 2007. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, has adopted rules requiring every public company to include a report of management on the effectiveness of such companys internal control over financial reporting in its annual report. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm must issue an attestation report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. These requirements will first apply to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may still issue an adverse report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or may issue a report that is qualified if such firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if such firm interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. During the course of such evaluation, documentation and testing, we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remedy in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. We also anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and devote significant management time and efforts and other resources to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In the past, we had certain material weakness and deficiencies in our internal controls. For example, during the course of the preparation and external audit of our consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, we and our independent registered public accounting firm noted a material weakness and a significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the applicable rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The material weakness observed was our lack of sufficient competent staff to perform period end reporting procedures, to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues, and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP. This material weakness resulted in material audit adjustments to our financial statements and corrections to the footnote disclosures. The significant deficiency observed was that we lacked adequate control over program development and program change within our revenue billing and recognition systems. As a result, it would be possible for erroneous code to be distributed to the revenue billing and recognition systems, which could negatively impact managements ability to properly initiate and record basic transactional data that are relied upon in generating revenue figures. As more fully described in Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsA. Operating ResultsInternal Control over Financial Reporting, following the identification of this significant deficiency and other weaknesses, we adopted certain steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. During the course of the preparation and external audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007, we and our independent registered public accounting firm noted a significant deficiency, i.e., as our business continues to expand, we will need to hire additional competent staff to address the increasing period end reporting requirements and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP, and we should ensure our accounting and financial reporting staff have adequate training to keep up with the rapid changes of our business and to keep up with our reporting requirement. We plan to implement additional steps, to address the significant deficiency and to improve our internal control over financial reporting generally. However, the implementation of these measures may not fully address the material weakness and the significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot yet conclude that they have been fully remedied. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely affected. 16 Table of Contents We may face execution risk with respect to our proposed purchase of office premises. We entered into an agreement for the purchase of the office premises and garage parking with an area of approximately 55,000 square meters in Chaoyang District, Beijing, in the first quarter of 2008. The aggregate purchase consideration is approximately RMB700 million, and we have paid approximately RMB580 million as of the date of this report. However, the premises have not been handed over to us and we have not been registered as the owner of the premises yet. If the seller fails to timely deliver us the premises or the delivered premises have defects, we may not timely use the premises as planned and our operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, although we and the seller have registered the pre-sale of the premises with the local construction commission, such registration provided us with limited protection compared with title certificate of the premises. Accordingly, the sellers breach of the purchase agreement may expose us to the sellers credit risk, and we may not be able to recover our advance payment and may suffer loss should the seller fail to fulfill its obligation under the purchase agreement. We plan to move the majority of our operations to the new office premises in the future. Due to the concentration of our operations, any future problem in our facilities such as loss of power or earthquake may limit our ability to operate our games, conduct research and development and provide customer service. In addition, if our operations do not need to occupy all the purchased premises for, we may lease out certain purchased office premises. We have no experience in leasing out office premises and may not be able to find appropriate lessees or timely collect rents or other payment from them, which may adversely affect our results of operations. We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks. Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, or another epidemic or outbreak. From 2005 to 2007, there have been reports on the occurrences of avian flu in various parts of China and elsewhere in Asia, including a few confirmed human cases and deaths. Any prolonged recurrence of avian flu, SARS or other adverse public health developments in China may have a material adverse effect on our business operations. Our operations may be impacted by a number of health-related factors, including, among other things, quarantines or closures of our offices which could severely disrupt our operations, the sickness or death of our key officers and employees, closure of Internet cafés and other public areas where people access the Internet, and a general slowdown in the Chinese economy. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future outbreak of avian flu, SARS or any other epidemic. 17 Table of Contents If tax benefits currently available to PW Software and PW Network are reduced or repealed, our business and results of operations could suffer. Prior to January 1, 2008, companies established in China were generally subject to a state and local enterprise income tax, or EIT, at statutory rates of 30% and 3% respectively. Under the PRC tax rules and policies then effective, an enterprise qualified both as a software enterprise and a high and new technology enterprise was entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15% and was further entitled to a two-year EIT exemption for the first two years during which it has cumulative taxable income, and a 50% reduction of its applicable EIT rate for the succeeding three years. In addition, an enterprise qualified as a high and new technology enterprise located in the Beijing New Industry Development Pilot Zone was entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15% and was further entitled to a three-year EIT exemption from either its first year of operation, or if it was incorporated in the second half of a calendar year, its second year of operation if so selected, and a 50% reduction of its applicable EIT rate for the succeeding three years. PW Network was then qualified both as a software enterprise and a high and new technology enterprise in China and enjoyed preferential tax treatments as a result of this status. PW Network did not have any cumulative taxable income during the period from March 10, 2004 (date of inception) to December 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. Therefore, 2007 and 2008 would be the first two years during which PW Network would have cumulative taxable income. Accordingly, PW Network was expected to be exempted from EIT in 2007 and 2008 and be entitled to a 50% reduction of its applicable EIT rate from 2009 to 2011. PW Software was then qualified as a high and new technology enterprise located in the Beijing New Industry Development Pilot Zone and enjoyed preferential tax treatments as a result of this status. PW Software was incorporated in the second half of 2006, and elected to be exempted from EIT from 2007 to 2009 and would be entitled to a 50% reduction of its applicable EIT rate from 2010 to 2012. On March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress of China enacted a new enterprise income tax law, or the New EIT Law, which has taken into effect from January 1, 2008. The implementing rules of the New EIT Law, or the Implementing Rules, were adopted on December 6, 2007 and have taken into effect from January 1, 2008. Under the New EIT Law, the Implementing Rules, the State Council circulars on implementation of enterprise tax transition preferential policy and relevant rules, foreign invested enterprises, such as our subsidiary, PW Software, and domestic companies would be subject to EIT at a uniform rate of 25%. Preferential tax treatments will continue to be granted to entities that are classified as high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State or conduct business in encouraged sectors, whether foreign invested enterprises or domestic companies. Furthermore, enterprises that were established and already enjoyed preferential tax exemption or reduction for a specified term will continue to enjoy them until the expiration of such term. Therefore, we believe  PW Network will continue to enjoy the above-mentioned tax exemption in 2008 and a 50% reduction of its applicable EIT rate from 2009 to 2011 so long as PW Network is qualified as a software enterprise. However, qualification as a software enterprise is subject to an annual assessment by the relevant government authority in China. There is no assurance that PW Network will continue to meet the qualifications or that the relevant government authority will not revoke its software enterprise status. If PW Network is qualified as a high and new technology enterprise strongly supported by the State, then PW Networks applicable EIT rate will be 15%; and  PW Software will continue to enjoy the above-mentioned tax exemption in 2008 and 2009 and a 50% reduction of its applicable EIT rate from 2010 to 2012. If PW Software is qualified as a high and new technology enterprise strongly supported by the State, then PW Softwares applicable EIT rate will be 15%. Since the New EIT Law and relevant rules were recently promulgated, there is still uncertainty with respect to their interpretation and implementation. The tax authorities may determine that PW Networks and/or PW Softwares entitlement to the above preferential tax treatment is contingent upon their qualifications as high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State. Furthermore, certain qualification requirements for high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State are not available yet, pending the issuance of additional implementing rules. Therefore, we cannot assure you that PW Network and PW Software will be 18 Table of Contents classified as a high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State, and continue to be entitled to the above preferential tax treatments. In addition, as determined and approved by the relevant tax authority, the sales proceeds that PW Network collects from our online game operations are subject to value-added tax, or VAT, which is at a rate of 17% of such proceeds. Pursuant to relevant tax rules, prior to the end of 2010, PW Network is entitled to a refund of the portion of VAT that exceeds 3% of its sales proceeds. When such refund policy expires at the end of 2010, PW Network would be subject to the regular 17% VAT rate, which would substantially increase our cost of revenues and materially affect our results of operation. Furthermore, according to a circular recently issued by local tax authorities, PW Network may be subject to a 5% business tax on its online game operation revenues in lieu of VAT. In the event PW Network is required to pay such business tax instead of VAT on its online game operation revenues before the expiration of the 14% VAT refund policy at the end of 2010, our cost of revenues will further increase, which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation. Moreover, PW Software is entitled to an exemption from business tax with respect to the game development business and related technology consultancy services that it engages in, which falls within the definition of technology development business. Any expiration of, or changes to, these tax benefits or treatments will have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our global income and the dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiary may be subject to PRC tax under the New EIT Law, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Under the New EIT Law and the Implementing Rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with de facto management bodies within the PRC is considered as a resident enterprise and will be subject to a PRC income tax on its global income. According to the Implementing Rules, de facto management bodies refer to establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise. Accordingly, we may be considered a resident enterprise and may therefore be subject to a PRC income tax on our global income. If we are considered a resident enterprise and earn income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiary, such PRC income tax on our global income could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. Under the applicable PRC tax laws in effect before January 1, 2008, dividend payments to foreign investors made by foreign-invested enterprises such as our PRC subsidiary, PW Software, are exempt from PRC withholding tax. Pursuant to the New EIT Law and the Implementing Rules which are effective as of January 1, 2008, however, dividends generated after January 1, 2008 and payable by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign investors will be subject to a 10% withholding tax if the foreign investors are considered as non-resident enterprises without any establishment or place within China or if the dividends payable have no connection with the establishment or place of the foreign investors within China, unless any such foreign investors jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. The Cayman Islands, where we are incorporated, does not have such a tax treaty with China. Perfect Hong Kong, our wholly owned subsidiary and the direct holder of 100% equity interest in PW Software, is incorporated in Hong Kong. According to the Arrangement between Mainland China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion in August 2006, or the Mainland and Hong Kong Taxation Arrangement, dividends paid by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its direct holding company in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of no more than 5% (if the foreign investor owns directly at least 25% of the shares of the foreign-invested enterprise). Under the New EIT Law and the 19 Table of Contents Implementing Rules, if Perfect Hong Kong is regarded as a resident enterprise, the dividends payable to Perfect Hong Kong from PW Software will be exempt from the PRC income tax. If Perfect Hong Kong is regarded as a non-resident enterprise and therefore is subject to a 5% withholding tax for any dividends payable to it from PW Software, the amount of funds available to us to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends to our shareholders, could be materially reduced. In addition, because there remains uncertainty regarding the interpretation and implementation of the New EIT Law and its implementation rules, if we are regarded as a PRC resident enterprise, then any dividends to be distributed by us to our non-PRC shareholders or any gains realized by non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders from transfer of our shares or ADSs may be subject to PRC withholding tax. If we are required under the New EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on the above dividends or gains, the investment in our shares or ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. We have limited business insurance coverage in China. The insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. As a result, we do not have any business liability, loss of data or disruption insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster might result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of our resources. Our dual-class ordinary share structure with different voting rights could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class B ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial. Our ordinary shares are divided into Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Holders of Class A ordinary shares are entitled to 10 votes per share, while holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per share. We issued Class B ordinary shares represented by our ADSs in our initial public offering in July 2007. Many of our major shareholders who acquired our shares prior to our initial public offering hold our Class A ordinary shares. As of the date of this report, holders of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares represent 79.7% of our aggregate voting power, and holders of our outstanding Class B ordinary shares represented 20.3% of our aggregate voting power. We continue to maintain the dual-class ordinary share structure. Each Class A ordinary share is convertible into one Class B ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof. Class B ordinary shares are not convertible into Class A ordinary shares under any circumstances. Upon any transfer of Class A ordinary shares by a holder thereof to any person or entity which is not an affiliate of such holder, such Class A ordinary shares shall be automatically and immediately converted into an equal number of Class B ordinary shares. Due to the disparate voting powers attached to these two classes, certain shareholders have significant voting power over matters requiring shareholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions that holders of Class B ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial. Our corporate actions are substantially controlled by our principal shareholders and affiliated entities. Our principal shareholders and their affiliated entities own more than a majority of our voting power due to our dual-class ordinary share structure. These shareholders, acting individually or as a group, could exert control and substantial influence over matters such as electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration of voting power may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our ADSs. 20 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure If the PRC government finds that the arrangements that establish the structure for operating our business do not comply with PRC government restrictions on foreign investment in the online game industry, we could be subject to severe penalties. We are a Cayman Islands company and, as such, we are classified as a foreign enterprise under Chinese laws, and our wholly-owned PRC subsidiary, PW Software, is a foreign-invested enterprise. Various regulations in China currently restrict or prevent foreign-invested entities from holding certain licenses required to operate online games, including Internet content provision, Internet culture operation and Internet publishing licenses. In light of these restrictions, we rely on PW Network to hold and maintain the licenses necessary to operate our online games in China. PW Network is a Chinese company controlled by Beijing Shiji Xiangshu Technology Co., Ltd., a PRC company controlled by Mr. Michael Yufeng Chi, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer. PW Network and its equity owners have entered into a series of contractual arrangements with PW Software to provide PW Software with effective control over PW Network. These include an exclusive technology support and service agreement, a development cooperation agreement, a business operation agreement, a call option agreement, an equity pledge agreement and a power of attorney. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see Item 4, Information on the CompanyHistory and Development of the Company and Item 7, Related Party TransactionsContractual Arrangements with PW Network and its Equity Owners. Under the equity pledge agreement, the shareholders of PW Network pledged their equity interests in PW Network to PW Software. According to the PRC Property Rights Law which has taken into effect as of October 1, 2007, such pledge has to be registered with the relevant administration for industry and commerce. PW Software applied for such registration, but the application was denied as no registration procedures were available. PW Software will continue to endeavor to register such pledge when the administration for industry and commerce implements registration procedures in accordance with PRC Property Rights Law in the future. We cannot assure you that PW Software will be able to register the pledge in the near future, and if PW Software is unable to do so, the effectiveness of such pledge may be affected. A circular issued by the Ministry of Information Industry (which has been reorganized into the Ministry of Industry and Information), or MII, in July 2006, reiterated the regulations on foreign investment in telecommunications businesses, which require foreign investors to set up foreign-invested enterprises and obtain a business operating license for Internet content provision, or ICP license, to conduct any value-added telecommunications business in China. Under this circular, a domestic company that holds an ICP license is prohibited from leasing, transferring or selling the license to foreign investors in any form, and from providing any assistance, including providing resources, sites or facilities, to foreign investors that conduct value-added telecommunications business illegally in China. Furthermore, the relevant trademarks and domain names that are used in the value-added telecommunications business must be owned by the local ICP license holder. The circular further requires each ICP license holder to have the necessary facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunications service providers are required to maintain network and information security in accordance with the standards set forth under relevant PRC regulations. Due to a lack of interpretative materials from the regulator, it is unclear what impact this circular will have on us or the other Chinese Internet companies that have adopted the same or similar corporate and contractual structures as ours. We have made verbal inquiries with the officials at the MII, but have not been able to get a definitive answer as to the applicability of the above circular to our corporate structure and to the enforcement and performance of the contractual arrangements between PW Software, PW Network and its shareholders. 21 Table of Contents In the opinion of King & Wood, our PRC counsel, (i) the ownership structure and the business and operation model of each of PW Software and PW Network are in compliance with all existing PRC laws and regulations, and (ii) each contract under PW Softwares contractual arrangements with PW Network and its shareholders is valid and binding, and will not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect. However, we cannot assure you that we will not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws and regulations. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including the above MII circular. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will ultimately take a view that is consistent with the opinion of our PRC counsel. If we are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, including the MII circular, the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violation, including levying fines, confiscating our income, revoking PW Softwares business license or PW Networks business or operating license, requiring us to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations, and requiring us to discontinue all or any portion of our online game operations. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. PW Softwares contractual arrangements with PW Network may result in adverse tax consequences to us. We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that PW Softwares contractual arrangements with PW Network were not made on an arms length basis and adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could result in a reduction, for PRC tax purposes, of adjustments recorded by PW Network, which could adversely affect us by (i) increasing PW Networks tax liability without reducing PW Softwares tax liability, which could further result in late payment fees and other penalties to PW Network for underpaid taxes; or (ii) limiting the ability of PW Software or PW Network to maintain preferential tax treatments and other financial incentives. PW Softwares contractual arrangements with PW Network and its equity owners may not be as effective in providing control over PW Network as direct ownership of PW Network. We conduct substantially all of our operations, and generate substantially all of our revenues, through contractual arrangements with PW Network and its equity owners that provide us with effective control over PW Network. We depend on PW Network to hold and maintain certain licenses necessary for our online game business. PW Network also owns all of the intellectual property, facilities and other assets relating to the operation of our online games in China, and employs the personnel for our online game operation and distribution. We have no ownership interest in PW Network. Although we have been advised by King & Wood, our PRC legal counsel, that each contract under PW Softwares contractual arrangements with PW Network is valid, binding and enforceable under current PRC laws and regulations, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over PW Network as direct ownership of PW Network. In addition, PW Network or its equity owners may breach the contractual arrangements. For example, PW Network may distribute dividends to its equity owners who may decide not to remit these dividends to us in accordance with the existing contractual arrangements. PW Network is wholly-owned by Beijing Shiji Xiangshu Technology Co., Ltd. and Beijing Jiuzhou Tianyuan Investment Management Co., Ltd., which are companies controlled by Mr. Michael Yufeng Chi, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, and several other beneficial owners of our ordinary shares. Conflicts of interest between their duties to our company and to PW Network may arise. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, the ultimate equity owners of PW Network will act completely in our interests or that conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. These ultimate equity owners could violate their non-competition or employment agreements with us or their legal duties by diverting business opportunities from us to others. 22 Table of Contents In any such event, we would have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be effective, particularly in light of uncertainties in the PRC legal system. See Risks Related to Doing Business in ChinaUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. Risks Related to Doing Business in China Our business may be adversely affected by public opinions and government policies and regulations in China. Due to the high degree of user loyalty to MMORPGs or other online games, easy access to personal computers and Internet cafés, and lack of more appealing forms of entertainment in China, many teenagers frequently play online games. This may result in these teenagers spending less time on or refraining from other activities, including academics and sports. Furthermore, excessive game play may adversely affect the health of players, especially teenage players. Internet cafés, which are currently the most important outlets for online games, have been criticized by the general public in China for having exerted a negative influence on the youth of China. Due primarily to such adverse public reaction, local and central governments in China have tightened their regulation of Internet café operations. A notice jointly issued by several central governmental agencies in February 2007 suspended nationwide the approval for the establishment of new Internet cafés in 2007 and increased the punishment for Internet cafés admitting minors. This notice also tightened the administration of in-game currency, and its impact on us and other operators of item-based online games is uncertain. Also, local and higher-level governmental authorities may from time to time decide to more strictly enforce the customers age limit and other requirements relating to Internet cafés as a result of the occurrence of, and the media attention on, gang fights, arson or other incidents in or related to Internet cafés. As most of our customers access our games from Internet cafés, any restrictions on Internet café operations could result in a reduction of the amount of time our customers spend on our online games or a reduction in or slowdown in the growth of our customer base or customer purchases of in-game items, thus adversely affecting our business and results of operations. Given the relatively limited use of personal computers in China and the relatively high cost of high-speed Internet access, closures or reduction in business hours of these cafés would significantly reduce the number of game players in China. In April 2007, the General Administration of Press and Publication of China, or GAPP, and several other governmental authorities issued a circular requiring the implementation of an anti-fatigue system and a real-name registration system by all PRC online game operators in an effort to curb addictive game play behaviors of minors under the age of eighteen. The item-based model that we adopted for most of our MMORPGs, including Legend of Martial Arts, Perfect World II, Zhu Xian and Chi Bi, may raise additional concerns with the PRC regulators who may find that a model that does not charge for time is inconsistent with the goal of reducing the overall playing time of young game players. As this is a relatively new revenue model for online games in China, it is uncertain how the PRC government authorities will react to the model and its effect on overall playing time. The PRC regulators may also have concerns about our casual game Hot Dance Party, which we offer in-game users free of charge. The implementation of the aforementioned systems and regulations may discourage or otherwise prevent or restrict our young and other customers from playing our online games, which could limit the growth of or reduce our revenues, thus adversely affecting our business and results of operations. If we fail to implement these systems timely and successfully, the relevant government authorities may have broad discretion in dealing with our noncompliance, including rejecting our application for the operation of new games, suspending our online game operations and revoking our relevant licenses. In addition, it is also possible that the PRC government authorities may decide to adopt more stringent policies to monitor the online game industry as a result of adverse public reaction or otherwise. Any such restrictions on online game playing would adversely affect our business and results of operations. 23 Table of Contents The limited use of personal computers in China and the relatively high cost of Internet access may limit the development of the Internet in China and impede our growth. Although the use of personal computers in China has increased in recent years, the penetration rate for personal computers in China is significantly lower than in the United States and other developed countries. Furthermore, despite a decrease in the cost of Internet access in China due to a decrease in the cost of personal computers and the introduction and expansion of broadband access, the cost of Internet access still remains relatively high. The limited use of personal computers in China and the relatively high cost of Internet access may limit the growth of our business. In addition, this will create serious challenges for our business and growth if the Chinese government authorities continue to more stringently regulate Internet cafés, including possibly closing a significant number of Internet cafés or reducing the hours that they are allowed to operate. See Our business may be adversely affected by public opinions and government policies and regulations in China. In addition, there is no assurance that there will not be any increase in Internet access or telecommunication fees in China. If that happens, the number of our players may decrease and the growth of our player base may be materially impeded. The continued growth of Chinas Internet market depends on the establishment of an adequate telecommunications infrastructure. Although private sector Internet service providers currently exist in China, almost all access to the Internet is maintained through state-owned telecommunications operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the MII. We rely on this infrastructure to provide data communications capacity primarily through local telecommunications lines. Although the government has announced plans to develop aggressively the national information infrastructure, we cannot assure you that this infrastructure will be developed as planned or at all. In addition, we will have no access to alternative networks and services, on a timely basis if at all, in the event of any infrastructure disruption or failure. The Internet infrastructure in China may not support the demands necessary for the continued growth in Internet usage. Adverse changes in political and economic policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position. Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China and most of our revenues are sourced from China. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to the economic, political and legal developments of China. Since the late 1970s, the PRC government has been reforming the economic system in China. These reforms have resulted in significant economic growth. However, we cannot predict the future direction of economic reforms or the effects such measures may have on our business, financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, while the economy of China has experienced significant growth in the past twenty years, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Rapid economic growth has led to growth in the supply of money and rising inflation which China is experiencing now. Rising inflation is eroding disposable incomes and consumer spending in China, and it may have an adverse effect on our profitability. In order to control inflation in the past, China has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending, which may lead to a slowing of economic growth. Any adverse change in the economic conditions in China, in policies of the PRC government or in laws and regulations in China, could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China and investment in the online game industry. Such developments could adversely affect our businesses, lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position. 24 Table of Contents The laws and regulations governing the online game industry in China are developing and subject to future changes. If we fail to obtain or maintain all applicable permits and approvals, our business and operations would be materially and adversely affected. The online game industry in China is highly regulated by the PRC government. Various regulatory authorities of the PRC central government, such as the State Council, the MII, the GAPP, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Public Security, are empowered to issue and implement regulations governing various aspects of the online game industry. We are required to obtain applicable permits or approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to provide online games. For example, an Internet content provider, or ICP, such as PW Network, must obtain an ICP license in order to engage in any commercial ICP operations within China. An online game operator must also obtain a license from the Ministry of Culture and an Internet publishing license from the GAPP in order to distribute games through the Internet. Before May 2008, we did not hold an Internet publishing license as the issuance of such licenses had been suspended by the GAPP. PW Network obtained an Internet publishing license in May 2008, which allows PW Network to distribute and publish online games on the Internet. Before PW Network obtained such an Internet publishing license, the online games we currently offer were published by an unrelated publisher which holds an electronic publishing license. The term of our agreements with that publisher in connection with the publication of our online games, namely, Perfect World, Legend of Martial Arts, Perfect World II, Zhu Xian, Chi Bi and Hot Dance Party, will expire on April 29, 2009, September 5, 2009, November 2, 2009, April 6, 2010, August 30, 2010 and January 8, 2011, respectively. The current PRC rules are not clear as to whether this practice is permissible, or whether any penalties shall be imposed on this practice. We have made verbal inquiries with the officials at the GAPP and been informed that the GAPP is aware of and does not object to such practice, where an online game operator publishes its online games through a holder of electronic publishing license, so long as the Internet publication of such online games has been filed with the GAPP. The Internet publication of all of our existing online games has been filed with the GAPP. If this practice is challenged by the GAPP, we may be subject to various penalties, including fines and the discontinuation or restriction of our operations. As the online game industry is at an early stage of development in China, new laws and regulations may be adopted from time to time to require additional licenses and permits other than those we currently have, and address new issues that arise. As a result, substantial uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of current and any future PRC laws and regulations applicable to the online game industry. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely obtain required licenses or any other new license required in the future, or at all. While we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect, we cannot assure you that we will not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws and regulations. 25 Table of Contents Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the Internet in China may adversely affect our business, and we may be liable for information displayed on, retrieved from, or linked to our Internet websites. The PRC government has adopted certain regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of news and other information over the Internet. Under these regulations, Internet content providers and Internet publishers are prohibited from posting or displaying over the Internet content that, among other things, violates PRC laws and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China, or is obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory. Meanwhile, when Internet content providers and Internet publishers find that information falling within the above scope is transmitted on their website or is stored in its electronic bulletin service system, they shall terminate the transmission of such information or delete such information immediately and keep records and report to relevant authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the revocation of the ICP license and other required licenses and the closure of the concerned websites. The website operator may also be held liable for such prohibited information displayed on, retrieved from or linked to such website. In addition, the MII has published regulations that subject website operators to potential liability for content included on their websites and the actions of users and others using their websites, including liability for violations of PRC laws prohibiting the dissemination of content deemed to be socially destabilizing. The Ministry of Public Security has the authority to order any local Internet service provider, or ISP, to block any Internet website maintained outside China at its sole discretion. Periodically, the Ministry of Public Security has stopped the dissemination over the Internet of information which it believes to be socially destabilizing. The State Secrecy Bureau, which is directly responsible for the protection of State secrets of the PRC government, is authorized to block any website it deems to be leaking State secrets or failing to meet the relevant regulations relating to the protection of State secrets in the dissemination of online information. As these regulations are relatively new and subject to interpretation by the relevant authorities, it may not be possible for us to determine in all cases the type of content that could result in liability for us as a website operator. In addition, we may not be able to control or restrict the content of other Internet content providers linked to or accessible through our websites, or content generated or placed on our websites by our users, despite our attempt to monitor such content. To the extent that regulatory authorities find any portion of our content objectionable, they may require us to limit or eliminate the dissemination of such information or otherwise curtail the nature of such content in our online games and on our websites, and keep records and report to relevant authorities, which may reduce our player base, the amount of time our games are played or the purchases of in-game items. This would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to significant penalties for violations of those regulations arising from information displayed on, retrieved from or linked to our online games and websites, including a suspension or shutdown of our operations. Recent PRC regulations relating to Internet video/audio program services may adversely affect the operation of our online games. On December 12, 2007, the State Administration on Radio, Film and Television, or SARFT, and MII promulgated the Administrative Measures on Internet Video/Audio Program Services, or the SARFT Rule, which requires that, among others, a service provider of Internet video/audio program shall obtain a license from SARFT, failure of which may result in the suspension or close of the website providing the Internet video/audio program services. On May 1, 2007, PW Network and Shanghai Feifahong Network Technology Co., Ltd., or Shanghai Feifahong Network, entered into an agreement under which Shanghai Feifahong Network provides PW Network with Internet video/audio program services on Shanghai Feifahong Networks website for our online games Perfect World, Legend of Martial Arts, Perfect World II and Zhu Xian. Shanghai Feifahong Network also covenants in the agreement that it shall obtain all necessary permits/licenses to perform this agreement. As of the date of this report, Shanghai Feifahong Network has not obtained the license on Internet video/audio service from SARFT and therefore Shanghai Feifahong Networks website may be suspended or closed under the SARFT Rule, which may adversely affect the operation of the above online games. 26 Table of Contents Recent PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident shareholders to personal liability and limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our subsidiarys ability to increase its registered capital, distribute profits to us, or otherwise adversely affect us. On October 21, 2005, the SAFE issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Reverse Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or Notice 75, which became effective as of November 1, 2005. According to Notice 75, prior registration with the local SAFE branch is required for PRC residents to establish or to control an offshore company for the purposes of financing that offshore company with assets or equity interests in an onshore enterprise located in the PRC. An amendment to registration or filing with the local SAFE branch by such PRC resident is also required for the injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise in the offshore company or overseas funds raised by such offshore company, or any other material change involving a change in the capital of the offshore company. Moreover, Notice 75 applies retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who have established or acquired control of offshore companies that have made onshore investments in the PRC in the past were required to complete the relevant registration procedures with the local SAFE branch by March 31, 2006. We have requested our shareholders who are PRC residents to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under Notice 75 and other related rules. We attempt to comply, and attempt to ensure that our shareholders who are subject to these rules comply, with the relevant requirements. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all of our shareholders who are PRC residents will comply with our request to make or obtain any applicable registrations or comply with other requirements required by Notice 75 or other related rules. The failure or inability of our PRC resident shareholders to make any required registrations or comply with other requirements may subject such shareholders to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into or provide loans to our PRC subsidiary or PW Network, limit our PRC subsidiarys ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute profits to us, or otherwise adversely affect us. We may be subject to fines and legal sanctions if we or our Chinese employees fail to comply with recent PRC regulations relating to employee stock options granted by overseas listed companies to PRC citizens. On March 28, 2007, the SAFE issued the Application Procedure for Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Holding Plans or Stock Option Plans of Overseas Listed Companies, or Notice 78. Under Notice 78, PRC citizens who participate in an employee stock option holding plan or a stock option plan of an overseas listed company are required, through a PRC domestic agent or PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures. We and our Chinese employees who have been granted restricted shares or stock options pursuant to our share incentive plan are subject to Notice 78 because we are an overseas listed company. If we or our Chinese employees fail to comply with the provisions of Notice 78, we and/or our Chinese employees may be subject to fines and legal sanctions imposed by the SAFE or other PRC government authorities. Our failure to obtain the prior approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, of the listing and trading of our ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation and trading price of our ADSs. On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, promulgated a regulation that became effective on September 8, 2006. This regulation, among other things, has some provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals shall obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPVs securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. 27 Table of Contents We completed the initial listing and trading of our ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market in July 2007. We did not seek CSRC approval in connection with our initial public offering. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement. Our PRC counsel, King & Wood, has advised us that, based on their understanding of the current PRC laws and regulations as well as the procedures announced on September 21, 2006:  The CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings like ours are subject to this new procedure;  In spite of the above, given that we had completed our restructuring before September 8, 2006, the effective date of the new regulation, and that our holding company, Perfect World, was formed for the sole purpose of facilitating private equity investment, this regulation does not require an application to be submitted to the CSRC for its approval of the issuance and sale of the ADSs and the Class B ordinary shares, or the listing and trading of our ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market; and  The issuance and sale of the ADSs and the Class B ordinary shares and the listing and trading of the ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market do not conflict with or violate this new PRC regulation. If the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that CSRC approval was required for our initial public offering, we may face regulatory actions or other sanctions from the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our initial public offering into the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ADSs. Also, if later the CSRC requires that we obtain its approval, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of the CSRC approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding this CSRC approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our ADSs. Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. We are a holding company, and we conduct our business primarily through our subsidiary and affiliated entity incorporated in China. These entities are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly-foreign owned enterprises. In addition, we depend on PW Network to honor its agreements with us. Almost all of these agreements are governed by PRC law and disputes arising out of these agreements are expected to be decided by arbitration in China. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. 28 Table of Contents We partly rely on dividends paid by our operating subsidiary in China for our cash needs. We partly rely on dividends paid by our PRC subsidiary, PW Software, for our cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions, if any, to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. The payment of dividends by entities organized in China is subject to limitations. Regulations in the PRC currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in China. PW Software is also required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. PW Software is also required to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits, as determined by its board of directors, to its staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners. In addition, if PW Software incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Fluctuation in the value of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on our business and result of operations. The change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political and economic conditions. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in an approximately 18.0% appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar by March 31, 2008. While the international reaction to the Renminbi revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. As substantially all of our costs and expenses are denominated in Renminbi, the revaluation beginning in July 2005 and potential future revaluation has and could further increase our costs in U.S. dollar terms. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from our initial public offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues or financing effectively. Substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in Renminbi. If our revenues denominated in Renminbi increase or expenses denominated in Renminbi decrease in the future, we may need to convert a portion of our revenues into other currencies to meet our foreign currency obligations, including, among others, payment of dividends declared, if any, in respect of our ordinary shares or ADSs. Under Chinas existing foreign exchange regulations, PW Software is able to pay dividends in foreign currencies, without prior approval from the SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, we cannot assure you that the PRC government will not take further measures in the future to restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions. Foreign exchange transactions by our subsidiary and affiliated entity in China under capital accounts continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of, or registration with, PRC governmental authorities. In particular, if our subsidiary or affiliated entity in China borrows foreign currency loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with the SAFE, and if we finance them by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved or registered by certain government authorities including the SAFE, the Ministry of Commerce or their local counterparts. These limitations could affect the ability of these entities to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing, and could affect our business and financial condition. 29 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Shares and ADSs The market price of our ADSs has been and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our ADSs has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. During the period from July 26, 2007, the first day on which our ADSs were listed on Nasdaq Global Market, until May 15, 2008, the trading price of our ADSs has ranged from US$17.40 to US$37.00 per ADS and the closing sale price on May 15, 2008 was US$30.31 per ADS. The market price for our ADSs may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;  changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;  conditions in the online game industry;  changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other online game companies;  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services, new revenue models, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  addition or departure of key personnel;  fluctuations of exchange rates between the RMB and U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies;  potential litigation or administrative investigations;  release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ADSs or ordinary shares or sales of additional ADSs; and  general economic or political conditions in China. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs. Substantial future sales of our ADSs or ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the price of our ADSs to decline. Additional sales of our ADSs or ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline. If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our ADSs, including those issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, in the public market, the market price of our ADSs could fall. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. If any existing shareholder or shareholders sell a substantial amount of ordinary shares, the prevailing market price for our ADSs could be adversely affected. In addition, we may issue additional ordinary shares or ADSs for future acquisitions. If we pay for our future acquisitions in whole or in part with additionally issued ordinary shares or ADSs, your ownership interests in our company would be diluted and this, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ADSs. You may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting materials in time to be able to exercise your right to vote. Except as described in this report, holders of our ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights attaching to the shares evidenced by our ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of our ADSs will appoint the depositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights attaching to the shares represented by the ADSs. You may not receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote, and it is possible that you, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote. 30 Table of Contents You may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result. We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. Under the deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will not offer those rights to ADS holders unless both the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or exempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. In addition, we may not be able to take advantage of any exemptions from registration under the Securities Act. The depositary may, but is not required to, sell such undistributed rights to third parties in this situation. Accordingly, holders of our ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result. You may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs. Your ADSs represented by the ADRs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason. You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law, conduct substantially all of our operations in China and most of our officers and directors reside outside the United States. We are incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and conduct substantially all of our operations in China through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China. Most of our officers and directors reside outside the United States and some or all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. It may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an original action against us or against these individuals in a Cayman Islands or Chinese court in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. You would also find it difficult to enforce a U.S. court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, in the United States, the Cayman Islands or China, against us or our officers and directors. Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the Companies Law (2007 Revision) and common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and provides significantly less protection to investors. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action before the federal courts of the United States. As a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. 31 Table of Contents We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of our ADSs or ordinary shares. Based on the price of the ADSs and our ordinary shares, the composition of our income and assets and our operations, we believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ending December 31, 2007. However, we must make a separate determination each year as to whether we are a PFIC (after the close of each taxable year). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC for our current taxable year ending December 31, 2008 or any future taxable year. A non-U.S. corporation will be considered a PFIC for any taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during the taxable year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. The future value of our assets is generally determined by reference to the market price of our ADSs and ordinary shares, which may fluctuate considerably given that market prices of technology companies have been especially volatile. If we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. person held an ADS or an ordinary share, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to such U.S. person. See Item 10, Additional InformationTaxationUnited States Federal Income TaxationPassive Foreign Investment Company. We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public company. As a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur a significantly higher level of legal, accounting and other expenses than we did as a private company. We have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these new rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.
