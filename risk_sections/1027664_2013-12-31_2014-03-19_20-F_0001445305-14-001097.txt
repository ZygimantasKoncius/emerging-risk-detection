Risk Factors – General Risks Related to Our Business and Market.)At December 31, 2013, we had outstanding buy-back obligations totaling approximately $1.0 billion that extend through 2023.Non-GAAP Financial DataThe following non-GAAP financial data is presented to enable investors to have additional information on our business performance as well as a further basis for periodical comparisons and trends relating to our financial results. We believe such data provides useful information to investors by facilitating more meaningful comparisons of our financial results over time. Such non-GAAP information is used by our management to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate our current performance. However, investors are cautioned that, unlike financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP measures may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies.The non-GAAP financial data below includes reconciliation adjustments regarding non-GAAP gross profit, operating income, net income and diluted EPS. In arriving at non-GAAP presentations, companies generally factor out items such as those that have a non-recurring impact on the income statements, various non-cash items, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation and changes in accounting guidance and other items which, in management’s judgment, are items that are considered to be outside the review of core operating results. In our non-GAAP presentation, we made certain adjustments as indicated in the table below.These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.54Reconciliation of GAAP (Audited) toNon-GAAP (Unaudited) Supplemental Financial Data(U.S. dollars in millions, except for per share amounts) Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 GAAP gross profit824.8 815.9 732.0Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets22.2 24.2 30.9Cessation of program(1)— — 72.8Impairment of long-lived assets0.9 — —Non-GAAP gross profit847.9 840.1 835.7Percent of revenues29.0% 29.1% 29.7% GAAP operating income239.4 203.1 115.7Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets45.9 49.3 57.3Cessation of program(1)— — 72.8Legal settlement(7.6) — —Impairment of long-lived assets(2)0.9 — —Non-GAAP operating income278.6 252.4 245.8Percent of revenues9.5% 8.7% 8.7% GAAP net income attributable to Elbit Systems’ shareholders183.4 167.9 90.3Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets45.9 49.3 57.3Cessation of program(1)— — 72.8Impairment of long-lived assets(2)0.9 — —Legal settlement(7.6) — 0.5Gain from changes in holdings(3)(0.9) (2.3) —Adjustment of loss (gain) from discontinued operations, net(0.8) 0.4 9.4Related tax benefits(10.1) (8.9) (23.7)Non-GAAP net income attributable to Elbit Systems’ shareholders210.8 206.4 206.6Percent of revenues7.2% 7.1% 7.3%Non-GAAP diluted net EPS5.0 4.9 4.8 (1)Adjustment of expenses related to cessation of a program, which resulted in write-off of inventories and other related costs.(2)Impairment of investments in 2013 was due to impairment in intangible assets.(3)Adjustment of gain from changes in holdings includes the income from the sale of investments in affiliated companies of $2.3 million in 2012 and a sale of activities of $0.9 million in 2013. 55Item 6.
