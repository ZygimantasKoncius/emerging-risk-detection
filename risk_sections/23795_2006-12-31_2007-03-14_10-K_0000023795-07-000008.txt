ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) FUTURE GROWTH AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THE AVAILABILITY OF WHICH IS NOT ASSURED We expect to continue making investments in real estate development. Based on the status of several specific real estate projects, we will continue to invest significant amounts in real estate over the next several years. We could finance future expenditures from any of the following sources: * cash flow from operations; * bank borrowings; * non-recourse, sale leaseback, or other financing; * public offerings of debt or equity; * private placement of debt or equity; or * some combination of the above. Financing for future expenditures may not be available on favorable terms or at all. COMPETITION AND MARKET CONDITIONS RELATING TO GOLF OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS Golf operations face competition from similar nearby golf operations. Any new competitive golf operations that are developed close to our existing golf operations also may adversely impact results of operations. Golf operations are also subject to adverse market conditions such as population trends and changing demographics, any of which could adversely affect results of operations. In addition, the golf operations may suffer if the economy weakens, if the popularity of golf decreases, or if unusual weather conditions or other factors cause a reduction in rounds played. Our golf operations are seasonal, primarily due to the impact of the winter tourist season and summer Florida heat and rain. OUR COMMON STOCK IS THINLY TRADED, AND THEREFORE, THE STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE MORE THAN THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or the stock prices of similar companies. Without a larger float, common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading prices for our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price than would be the case if public float were larger. ITEM 1B.
