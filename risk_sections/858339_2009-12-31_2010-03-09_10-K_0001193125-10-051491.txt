ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. If we are unable to effectively compete against our competitors, our profits will decline. The gaming industry is highly competitive and our competitors vary considerably in size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, and with various other entertainment businesses. Our competitors in each market that we participate may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and there can be no assurance that they will not in the future engage in aggressive pricing action to compete with us. Although we believe we are currently able to compete effectively in each of the various markets in which we participate, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to do so or that we will be capable of maintaining or further increasing our current market share. Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In recent years, with fewer new markets opening for development, many casino operators have been reinvesting in existing markets to attract new customers or to gain market share, thereby increasing competition in those markets. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some markets, including Las Vegas, our largest market, and competition has increased significantly. For example, CityCenter, a large development of resorts and residences, opened in December 2009 in Las Vegas. The expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue. These competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance in certain markets, including Atlantic City. In particular, our business may be adversely impacted by the additional gaming and room capacity in Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Ohio, Louisiana, Ontario, South Africa, Uruguay, United Kingdom, Egypt and/or other projects not yet announced which may be competitive in the other markets where we operate or intend to operate. Several states and Native American tribes are also considering enabling the development and operation of casinos or casino- like operations in their jurisdictions. In addition, our operations located in New Jersey and Nevada may be adversely impacted by the expansion of Native American gaming in New York and California, respectively. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and taxation policies, the enforcement of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to extensive gaming regulations and political and regulatory uncertainty. Regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines and take other actions, any one of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, revenues and income from operations were negatively impacted during July 2006 in Atlantic City by a three-day governmentimposed casino shutdown. From time to time, individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums, such as bans on smoking in casinos and other entertainment and dining facilities, which could adversely impact our operations. For example, the City Council of Atlantic City passed an ordinance in 2007 requiring that we segregate at least 75% of the casino gaming floor as a nonsmoking area, leaving no more than 25% of the casino gaming floor as a smoking area. Illinois has also passed the Smoke Free Illinois Act which became effective January 1, 2008, and bans smoking in nearly all public places, including bars, restaurants, work places, schools and casinos. The Act also bans smoking within 15 feet of any entrance, window or air intake area of these public places. These smoking bans have adversely affected revenues and operating results at our properties. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance. The casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate. From time to time, various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, including increases in tax rates, which would affect the industry. If adopted, such changes could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 8 Table of Contents The development and construction of new hotels, casinos and gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones are susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may decide to develop, construct and open new hotels, casinos and other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise. Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third party-debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets, which could have an adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. The development and construction of new hotels, casinos and gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones, such as our recent expansion at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, are susceptible to various risks and uncertainties, such as:  the existence of acceptable market conditions and demand for the completed project;  general construction risks, including cost overruns, change orders and plan or specification modification, shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor, labor disputes, unforeseen environmental, engineering or geological problems, work stoppages, fire and other natural disasters, construction scheduling problems and weather interferences;  changes and concessions required by governmental or regulatory authorities;  the ability to finance the projects, especially in light of the substantial indebtedness incurred by us related to the Acquisition;  delays in obtaining, or inability to obtain, all licenses, permits and authorizations required to complete and/or operate the project; and  disruption of our existing operations and facilities. Our failure to complete any new development or expansion project as planned, on schedule, within budget or in a manner that generates anticipated profits, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The recent downturn in the national economy, the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the global economy could negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to access financing. The recent severe economic downturn and adverse conditions in the local, regional, national and global markets have negatively affected our operations, and may continue to negatively affect our operations in the future. During periods of economic contraction such as the current period, our revenues may decrease while some of our costs remain fixed or even increase, resulting in decreased earnings. Gaming and other leisure activities we offer represent discretionary expenditures and participation in such activities may decline during economic downturns, during which consumers generally earn less disposable income. Even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending in our gaming operations and related facilities, as consumers spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn. Furthermore, other uncertainties, including national and global economic conditions, terrorist attacks or other global events, could adversely affect consumer spending and adversely affect our operations. Acts of terrorism and war, natural disasters and severe weather may negatively impact our future profits. Terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties. We cannot predict the extent to which terrorism, security alerts or war, or hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan and other countries throughout the world will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results. As a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. Given current conditions in the global insurance markets, we are substantially uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely impacted. In addition, natural disasters such as major fires, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes could also adversely impact our business and operating results. For example, four of our properties were closed for an extended period of time due to the damage sustained from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in August and September 2005, respectively. Such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely impacted. In most cases, we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, is out of our control. 9 Table of Contents Additionally, a natural disaster affecting one or more of our properties may affect the level and cost of insurance coverage we may be able to obtain in the future, which may adversely affect our financial position. As our operations depend in part on our customers ability to travel, severe or inclement weather can also have a negative impact on our results of operations. Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits. Some of our employees are represented by labor unions. A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at one of our casino properties or construction projects could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our nonunion employees. While these efforts have achieved only limited success to date, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future. There has been a trend towards unionization for employees in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. For example, certain dealers at certain of our Atlantic City properties have voted to be represented by the United Auto Workers; however, to date, there are no collective bargaining agreements in place. The impact of this union activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our profits. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of current or potential future acquisitions. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the businesses of such acquired company with our businesses. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time consuming process. This process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies, and may not result in the full benefits expected. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:  coordinating marketing functions;  unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;  unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;  retaining key employees;  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;  the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns; and  coordinating geographically separate organizations. There is no assurance that we will realize the full benefits anticipated for any current or future acquisitions. The risks associated with our international operations could reduce our profits. Some of our properties are located in countries outside the United States, and our acquisition of London Clubs in 2006 has increased the percentage of our revenue derived from operations outside the United States. International operations are subject to inherent risks including:  variation in local economies;  currency fluctuation;  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;  trade barriers;  burden of complying with a variety of international laws; and  political and economic instability. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. The leadership of our chief executive officer, Mr. Loveman, and other executive officers has been a critical element of our success. The death or disability of Mr. Loveman or other extended or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our other executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could also adversely affect us. We are not protected by key man or similar life insurance covering members of our senior management. We have employment agreements with our executive officers, but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with the company. 10 Table of Contents If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate employees, we may not be able to compete effectively and will not be able to expand our business. Our success and ability to grow are dependent, in part, on our ability to hire, retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people, with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and expand our business, in many locations around the world. Competition for highly qualified, specialized technical and managerial, and particularly consulting personnel, is intense. Recruiting, training, retention and benefit costs place significant demands on our resources. Additionally, the recent downturn in the gaming, travel and leisure sectors has made recruiting executives to our business more difficult. The inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have an adverse effect on us. We are controlled by the Sponsors, whose interests may not be aligned with ours. All of the voting common stock of Harrahs is held by Hamlet Holdings LLC, the members of which are comprised of an equal number of individuals affiliated with each of the Sponsors. As such, the Sponsors have the power to control our affairs and policies. The Sponsors also control the election of our board of directors, and the appointment of management, and, if desired, the entering into of mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets or other extraordinary transactions. Eight of our eleven directors have been appointed by the Sponsors. In addition, two of the three members of our Executive Committee, both members of our Human Resources Committee and two of the three members of our Audit Committee are affiliated with the Sponsors. The members affiliated with the Sponsors have the authority, subject to the terms of our debt, to issue additional shares, implement share repurchase programs, declare dividends, pay advisory fees and make other decisions, and they may have an interest in our doing so. Furthermore, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, as well as businesses that represent major customers of our businesses. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the individuals affiliated with the Sponsors continue to control a significant amount of our outstanding voting common stock, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. We are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition. From time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits relating to matters incidental to our business. The nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners, Native American tribes and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. For example, we may have potential liability arising from a class action lawsuit against Hilton Hotels Corporation relating to employee benefit obligations. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our senior secured credit facilities, the real estate facility loans and the indentures governing most of Harrahs Operatings existing notes contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things:  incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;  make certain investments;  sell certain assets;  create liens on certain assets;  consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and  designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. 11 Table of Contents We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior secured credit facilities, our real estate facility loans and our first lien notes and our second lien notes. If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness. Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our senior secured credit facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under the facilities or the existing agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default under our senior secured credit facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:  will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;  could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or  require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings. Such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities, our real estate facilities and our first and second lien notes could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the indebtedness under our first and second lien notes, senior secured credit facilities, real estate facilities or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments. We are a highly leveraged company. As of December 31, 2009, we had $22,051.9 million face value of outstanding indebtedness and our current debt service obligation is $1,690.8 million, which includes required interest payments of $1,616.5 million. As of December 31, 2009, HOC had $17,354.3 million face value of outstanding indebtedness including $853.9 million owed to HET, and HOCs debt service obligation is $1,559.3 million, which includes required interest payments of $1,485.0 million. Our substantial indebtedness could:  limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, debt service requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;  make us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;  make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, developing new gaming facilities, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities; and  limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets. Furthermore, our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because certain of our debt is variable-rate debt. 12 Table of Contents Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt. This could intensify the risks described above. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness at any time from time to time, including in the future. Although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. For example, as of December 31, 2009, we had $1,040.8 million available for additional borrowing under our revolving credit facility after giving effect to approximately $162.2 million in outstanding letters of credit, all of which would be secured. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:  our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and  our future ability to borrow under our senior secured credit facilities, the availability of which depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in our senior secured credit facilities. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to draw under our senior secured credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. The Sponsors have no continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing.
