Item 1A. Risk FactorsOil and natural gas prices are volatile. A substantial decrease in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our financial results.Our future financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Substantial decreases in commodity prices in the future could require us to record full cost ceiling test write-downs. The amount of any future write-down is difficult to predict and will depend upon oil and natural gas prices, the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent.Our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil. This price volatility also affects the amount of our cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. Oil prices currently affect us more than natural gas prices because oil comprised approximately 94% of our 2013 production and 83% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2013.The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the supply of, and demand for, these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including:•the level of worldwide consumer demand for oil and natural gas;•the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;•the degree to which domestic oil and natural gas production decreases U.S. imports of crude oil;•the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;•domestic governmental regulations and taxes;•the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;•storage levels of oil and natural gas;•weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, and winter conditions and forest fires in the Rocky Mountains that can delay or impede operations;•market uncertainty;•worldwide political events and conditions, including actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations; and- 25 -Table of ContentsDenbury Resources Inc.•worldwide economic conditions.These factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements. Also, prices for oil and prices for natural gas do not necessarily move in tandem. Declines in oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. If the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines, we may, among other things, be unable to meet all of our financial obligations or make planned expenditures.Over the past six years oil prices have fluctuated significantly, reaching record highs of approximately $145 per Bbl in July 2008, declining precipitously during the last half of 2008, and ending that year at a NYMEX price of $44.60 per Bbl. Since 2008, oil prices have continued to fluctuate, ending 2013 at a NYMEX price of $98.42 per Bbl. If substantial volatility of oil prices continues, oil prices could decline to a level that makes some or all of our tertiary projects uneconomical. If that were to happen, we may decide to suspend future expansion projects, and if prices were to drop below our cash break-even point for an extended period of time, we may further decide to shut-in existing production, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We may also be required to reduce our capital expenditures in the event of declining commodity prices in order to compensate for diminished cash flow, which could reduce or eliminate our growth. Since operating costs do not decrease as quickly as commodity prices, it is difficult to determine a precise break-even point for our tertiary projects; however, based on prior history, we currently estimate our economic break-even point (before corporate-related overhead and based on currently estimated expenses relative to these tertiary projects) occurs at oil prices in the low-to-mid $40-per-barrel range, depending on the specific field and area.We have a current practice of hedging approximately 18 months to two years (from the current quarter) of forecasted production to mitigate the risks associated with price fluctuations (see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Market Risk Management and Note 9, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding our commodity derivative contracts). As of February 20, 2014, we have oil derivative contracts in place covering 58,000 Bbls/d during 2014 and 58,000 Bbls/d during the first three quarters of 2015. The prices we receive for our crude oil often do not correlate with NYMEX prices and can vary from such prices depending on, among other factors, the quality of the crude oil we sell, the location of our crude oil production and the related markets to which we sell, variations in prices paid based upon different indices used, and the pricing contracts and indices at which we sell production. Our NYMEX differentials on a field-by-field basis over the last few years have ranged from approximately $25 per Bbl above NYMEX to approximately $25 per Bbl below NYMEX. On a corporate-wide basis, our NYMEX differentials over the last few years have ranged from approximately $11 per Bbl above NYMEX oil prices to approximately $5 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices. These variances have been due to various factors and are difficult to forecast or anticipate, but they have a direct impact on the net oil price we receive.Natural gas price volatility has been severe over the last few years as a result of, among other things, weak demand, increased production of natural gas, and significant natural gas storage in place, leading to excess gas supply. NYMEX natural gas prices averaged $4.03 per MMBtu during 2011, $2.82 per MMBtu during 2012, and $3.72 per MMBtu during 2013, and ended 2013 at $4.23 per MMBtu. As of February 20, 2014, we have natural gas derivative contracts in place covering 14,000 MMBtu/d during 2014 and 6,000 MMBtu/d during 2015 (see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Market Risk Management and Note 9, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding our commodity derivative contracts).Our production will decline if our access to sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide is limited.Our long-term strategy is focused on our CO2 tertiary recovery operations. The crude oil production from our tertiary recovery projects depends, in large part, on having access to sufficient amounts of CO2. Our ability to produce oil from these projects would be hindered if our supply of CO2 was limited due to, among other things, problems with our current CO2 producing wells and facilities, including compression equipment, or catastrophic pipeline failure. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our anticipated future crude oil production from tertiary operations is also dependent on the timing, volumes and location of CO2 injections and, in particular, on our ability to increase our combined purchased and produced volumes of CO2 and inject adequate amounts of CO2 into the proper formation and area within each of our tertiary oil fields.- 26 -Table of ContentsDenbury Resources Inc.Our planned tertiary operations and the related construction of necessary CO2 pipelines could be delayed by difficulties in obtaining pipeline rights-of-way and/or permits, and/or by the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered.The production of crude oil from our planned tertiary operations is dependent upon having access to pipelines to transport available CO2 to our oil fields at a cost that is economically viable. Our current and future construction of CO2 pipelines will require us to obtain rights-of-way from private landowners and from the federal government in certain areas. Certain states where we operate are considering the adoption of laws and regulations that would limit or eliminate a state’s (and, accordingly, its legislative delegates') ability to exercise eminent domain over private property, in addition to possible judicially imposed constraints on, and additional requirements for, the exercise of eminent domain. We also conduct operations on federal and other oil and natural gas leases inhabited by species, such as the sage grouse, that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, which listing could lead to material restrictions as to federal land use. These laws and regulations, together with any other changes in law related to the use of eminent domain or the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered, could inhibit or eliminate our ability to secure rights-of-way or otherwise access land for current or future pipeline construction projects. As a result, obtaining rights-of-way or other means of access may require additional regulatory and environmental compliance, and increased costs in connection therewith, which could delay our CO2 pipeline construction schedule and initiation of our pipeline operations, and/or increase the costs of constructing our pipelines.Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect operations and limit our growth.As of December 31, 2013, our outstanding senior indebtedness consisted of $2.6 billion principal amount of subordinated notes, virtually all of which have maturity dates between 2020 and 2023 at interest rates ranging from 4.625% to 8.25% per annum at a weighted average interest rate of 6.29% per annum, and $340.0 million principal amount outstanding under our bank credit facility. We currently have a borrowing base of $1.6 billion under our bank credit facility and, at December 31, 2013, availability with respect to such borrowing base of $1.2 billion. Our bank borrowing base is adjusted semi-annually and upon requested special redeterminations, in each case at the banks’ discretion, and the amount is established and based, in part, upon certain external factors, such as commodity prices, over which we have no control. If the outstanding credit under our bank credit facility exceeds the then effective and redetermined borrowing base, we will be required to repay the excess amount over a period not to exceed four months.We may incur additional indebtedness in the future under our bank credit facility in connection with, among other things, our acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties. Further, as our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas, if oil and natural gas prices decrease substantially and remain at depressed levels for an extended period of time, our degree of leverage could increase significantly. The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to the following:•our level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate and other purposes;•our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions may be greater as a result of our level of indebtedness, and increases in interest rates thereon, potentially restricting us from making acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities;•our interest expense may increase in the event of increases in market interest rates;•a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations may be dedicated to servicing our indebtedness and would not be available for capital expenditures or other purposes;•our ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments may be limited by the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness; and•our debt covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry, and our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under such debt instruments which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants related to such indebtedness, including covenants in our bank credit facility, we would be in default under our debt instruments. This default could permit the holders of such indebtedness - 27 -Table of ContentsDenbury Resources Inc.to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause defaults under other indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments will depend, in part, upon our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors, including factors beyond our control.Commodity derivative contracts may expose us to potential financial loss.To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity derivative contracts in order to economically hedge a substantial portion of our oil and natural gas production. Derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received, or when the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations. In addition, these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. Information as to these activities is set forth under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Market Risk Management, and in Note 9, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.There are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future and at what level.On January 28, 2014, we declared our first quarterly cash common stock dividend of $0.0625 per share, payable March 25, 2014, to shareholders of record on February 25, 2014. We currently intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in the future; however, our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected if certain of the risks described herein were to occur. Our payment of dividends is subject to, and conditioned upon, among other things, compliance with the covenants and restrictions contained in our bank credit facility and the indentures governing our subordinated notes. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our earnings, financial condition and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. There are no assurances as to our ability to pay dividends in the future or the level thereof.A worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot control or predict.Liquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by an inability to obtain capital in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or equity capital markets or an inability to access bank financing. A prolonged credit crisis, including a sovereign debt crisis in Europe or turmoil in the global financial system, could materially affect our liquidity, business and financial condition. These conditions have adversely impacted financial markets and have created substantial volatility and uncertainty, and may continue to do so, with the related negative impact on global economic activity and the financial markets. Negative credit market conditions could materially affect our liquidity and may inhibit our lenders from fully funding our bank credit facility or cause them to make the terms of our bank credit facility more costly and more restrictive. We are subject to semiannual, as well as unscheduled, reviews and redeterminations of our borrowing base under our bank credit facility, and we do not know, nor can we control, the results of such redeterminations or the effect of then-current oil and natural gas prices on any such redetermination. A negative economic situation could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers and cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or otherwise seek bankruptcy protection. Additionally, negative economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for oil and natural gas, or lower prices for oil and natural gas, which could have a negative impact on our revenues.Our future performance depends upon our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.Unless we can successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations. We have historically replaced reserves through both acquisitions and internal organic growth activities. In the future, we may not be able to continue to replace reserves at acceptable costs. The business of exploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive. We may not be able to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if our cash flows from operations are reduced, whether due to lower oil or natural gas prices or otherwise, or if external sources of capital become limited or - 28 -Table of ContentsDenbury Resources Inc.unavailable. Further, the process of using CO2 for tertiary recovery, and the related infrastructure, requires significant capital investment up to five years prior to any resulting and associated production and cash flows from these projects, heightening potential capital constraints. If we do not continue to make significant capital expenditures, or if outside capital resources become limited, we may not be able to maintain our growth rate or otherwise meet expectations.During the last few years, we have acquired several fields at a substantial cost because we believe that they have significant additional production potential through tertiary flooding, and we plan to continue acquiring other oil fields that we believe are tertiary flood candidates. We are investing significant amounts of capital as part of this strategy. If we are unable to successfully develop and produce the potential oil in these acquired fields, it would negatively affect our return on investment relative to these acquisitions and could significantly reduce our ability to obtain additional capital for the future or fund future acquisitions, and also negatively affect our financial results to a significant degree.Oil and natural gas development and producing operations involve various risks.Our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident and inherent to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including, without limitation, well blowouts; cratering and explosions; pipe failure; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids; release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks.The nature of these risks is such that some liabilities could exceed our insurance policy limits or otherwise be excluded from, or limited by, our insurance coverage, as in the case of environmental fines and penalties, for example, which are excluded from coverage as they cannot be insured. We could incur significant costs related to these risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our CO2 tertiary recovery projects require a significant amount of electricity to operate the related facilities. If these costs were to increase significantly, it could have an adverse effect upon the profitability of these operations. Additionally, a portion of our production activities involves CO2 injections into fields with wells plugged and abandoned by prior operators. Although it is often difficult (or impracticable) to determine whether a well has been properly plugged prior to commencing injections and pressuring the oil reservoirs, we have budgeted $50 million for this effort for 2014. We may incur significant costs in connection with remedial plugging operations to prevent environmental contamination and to otherwise comply with federal, state and local regulation relative to the plugging and abandoning of our oil, natural gas and CO2 wells. In addition to the increased costs, if wells have not been properly plugged, modification to those wells may delay our operations and reduce our production.While mitigated somewhat by our significant emphasis on tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that have historically produced substantial volumes of oil under primary production, development activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that new wells drilled by us will not result in the discovery of commercially productive reservoirs or the risk that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:•unexpected drilling conditions;•title problems;•pressure or irregularities in formations;•equipment failures or accidents;•adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, and winter conditions and forest fires in the Rocky Mountain region that can delay or impede operations;•compliance with environmental and governmental requirements; and•the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, pipelines and services.- 29 -Table of ContentsDenbury Resources Inc.Certain of our operations may be limited during certain periods due to severe weather conditions and other regulations.Certain of our operations in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, including the construction of CO2 pipelines, the drilling of new wells and production from existing wells, are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions, including severe cold, snow and rain, which conditions may cause such operations to be hindered or delayed, or otherwise require that they be conducted only during non-winter months, and depending on the severity of the weather, could have a negative effect on our results of operations in these areas. Further, certain of our operations in these areas are confined to certain time periods due to environmental regulations, federal restrictions on when drilling can take place on federal lands, and lease stipulations designed to protect certain wildlife, which regulations, restrictions and limitations could slow down our operations, cause delays, increase costs and have a negative effect on our results of operations.Shortages of oil field equipment, services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results of operations.The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages in such personnel. In recent years, the competition for qualified technical personnel has been fierce, and our personnel costs have been escalating at a rate higher than general inflation. During periods of high oil and natural gas prices, we have experienced shortages of oil field and other necessary equipment, as well as drilling rigs, as demand for equipment and rigs has increased in tandem with higher commodity prices. Additionally, higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand, which results in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, oilfield equipment and services, and personnel in our exploration and production operations. These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill wells and conduct those operations that we currently have planned and budgeted, causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation lines and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. When these facilities are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.The marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends, in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation lines owned by third parties. In general, we do not control these transportation facilities, and our access to them may be limited or denied. A significant disruption in the availability of, and access to, these transportation lines or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations.Governmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection are costly and stringent.Our exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations. In addition, some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances, including petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators. Changes in, or additions to, environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes or additions that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, cleanup or other environmental protection requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.Enactment of legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business.Numerous legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by Congress and various federal agencies. Among these proposals are: (1) climate change/carbon tax legislation introduced in Congress, and EPA regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (2) - 30 -Table of ContentsDenbury Resources Inc.proposals contained in the President's budget, along with legislation introduced in Congress (none of which have passed), to impose new taxes on, or repeal various tax deductions available to, oil and gas producers, such as the current tax deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and qualified tertiary injectant expenses which deductions, if eliminated, could raise the cost of energy production, reduce energy investment and affect the economics of oil and gas exploration and production activities; (3) legislation previously considered by Congress (but not adopted) that would subject the process of hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and new or anticipated Department of Interior and EPA regulations to impose new and more stringent regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, particularly those performed on federal lands, and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process; and (4) the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act enacted in 2011, which increases penalties, grants new authority to impose damage prevention and incident notification requirements, and directs the Department of Transportation to prescribe minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines. Any of the foregoing described proposals could affect our operations and the costs thereof. The trend toward stricter standards, increased oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions that could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition.Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated, and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.In recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax benefits and deductions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (2) the increase of the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses, (3) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and qualified tertiary injectant expenses, and (4) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities. It is currently unclear whether any such proposals will be enacted into law and, if so, what form such laws might possibly take or impact they may have; however, the passage of such legislation or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate, reduce or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us, and any such legislation or change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.The derivatives market regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market, including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. Our derivative transactions are not currently subject to such swap clearing and trade execution requirements; however, in the event our derivative transactions potentially become subject to such requirements, we believe that our derivative transactions would qualify for the "end-user" exception. New or modified rules, regulations or requirements may increase the cost and availability to our counterparties of their hedging and swap positions that they can make available to us, and may further require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to separate entities that may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation or post margin collateral. Any changes in the regulations of swaps may result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or cease their derivative activities. While many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations, including the proposed margin rules, remain to be finalized or effectuated; therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (1) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (2) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, (3) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and (4) increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules and regulations, our cash flow may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.- 31 -Table of ContentsDenbury Resources Inc.The loss of one or more of our large oil and natural gas purchasers could have an adverse effect on our operations.For the year ended December 31, 2013, three purchasers individually accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues and, in the aggregate, for 58% of such revenues. The loss of a large single purchaser could adversely impact the prices we receive or the transportation costs we incur.Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty. Estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors such as future commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental rules and regulations. There are numerous uncertainties about when a property may have proved reserves as compared to potential or probable reserves, particularly relating to our tertiary recovery operations. Forecasting the amount of oil reserves recoverable from tertiary operations, and the production rates anticipated therefrom, requires estimates, one of the most significant being the oil recovery factor. Actual results most likely will vary from our estimates. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor for reporting purposes, as prescribed by the SEC, may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which our business, and the oil and natural gas industry in general, are subject. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions, or changes of conditions, could result in a reduction of the quantities and net present value of our reserves.The reserves data included in documents incorporated by reference represent estimates only. Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions, including first-day-of-the-month average oil and natural gas prices for the 12-month period preceding the date of the assessment. Our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes in economic conditions, including oil and natural gas prices, as well as due to production results, results of future development, operating and development costs, and other factors. Downward revisions of our reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in our estimates.As of December 31, 2013, approximately 38% of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and may require successful drilling operations. The reserves data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, but these assumptions may not be accurate, and these expenditures and operations may not occur.Significant acquisitions or other transactions could require substantial external capital and could change our risk and property profile.To finance acquisitions, we may need to substantially alter or increase our capitalization through the use of our bank credit facility, the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments, or by other means. Such changes in capitalization could significantly affect our risk profile. Additionally, significant acquisitions or other transactions can change the character of our operations and business. The character of the new properties may be substantially different in operating or geological characteristics or geographic location from that of our existing properties.Our results of operations could be negatively affected as a result of goodwill impairments.At December 31, 2013, the Company's goodwill balance totaled $1.3 billion and represented approximately 10.9% of our total assets. Goodwill is not amortized; rather it is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the Company's goodwill may be impaired, requiring an estimate of the fair values of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities. An impairment of goodwill could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and equity. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Impairment Assessment of Goodwill.- 32 -Table of ContentsDenbury Resources Inc.We may lose executive officers or other key management personnel, which could endanger the future success of our operations.Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key management personnel. Our employees, including our executive officers, are employed at will and do not have employment agreements. If one or more members of our management team dies, becomes disabled or voluntarily terminates employment with us, there is no assurance that we will find a suitable or comparable substitute. We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial personnel. Competition for persons with these skills is intense, and we cannot assure that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel. The loss of any of our management personnel could adversely affect our operations.A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations.To date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsThere are no unresolved written SEC staff comments regarding our periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 received 180 days or more before the end of the fiscal year to which this annual report on Form 10-K relates.
