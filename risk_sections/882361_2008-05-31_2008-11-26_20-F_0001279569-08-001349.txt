D. Risk Factors Before making an investment decision with respect to our common shares, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. Additional risks not currently known by us or that we consider immaterial at the present time may also impair our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations would likely be affected. In that case, the trading price of our common shares could decline and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common shares. The risks set out below are not the only we currently face; other risks may arise in the future. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We need to raise additional capital. Our current capital resources are not sufficient to fund our long-term business strategy or to repay our convertible debentures. We need to raise additional capital. To obtain the necessary capital, we must rely on any or all of; grants and tax credits, additional share issues and collaboration agreements or corporate partnerships to provide full or partial funding for our activities. We cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on terms which are acceptable to us or in amounts that will enable us to carry out our business plan. If we cannot obtain the necessary capital, we will have to: • engage in equity financings that would result in significant dilution to existing investors; • delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs; • obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favourable to us than might otherwise be available; or 7 • considerably reduce, even cease our operations. Our cash flow is not sufficient to repay our debentures at maturity. Our ability to repay our convertible debentures at maturity or refinance our prime plus 1% convertible debentures due in October 2009 will depend on our ability to generate or raise sufficient cash or refinance them. Given the current market capitalization of the Company it is unlikely that the Company will be able to raise additional funds to repay this liability. If we cannot repay or refinance the debentures at or prior to maturity, the lender may, at its discretion: • commence legal action; • take possession of our assets; • carry on our business; • appoint a receiver; and • take any other action permitted by law to obtain payment. We have a history of operating losses. We expect to incur net losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. We have not been profitable since our inception in 1986. We reported net losses of $6.3 million; $9.6 million and $17.9 million for the years ended May 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of May 31, 2008, we had an accumulated deficit of $180.5 million. To date we have only generated nominal revenues from the sale of Virulizin® in Mexico and we stopped selling Virulizin® in Mexico in July 2005. We have not generated any other revenue from product sales to date and it is possible that we will never have sufficient product sales revenue to achieve profitability. We expect to continue to incur losses for at least the next several years as we or our collaborators and licensees pursue clinical trials and research and development efforts. To become profitable, we, either alone or with our collaborators and licensees, must successfully develop, manufacture and market our current product candidates, LOR-2040, as well as continue to identify, develop, manufacture and market new product candidates. It is possible that we will never have significant product sales revenue or receive significant royalties on our licensed product candidates. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may not be able to develop or commercialize our products, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. We are an early stage development company. We are at an early stage of development. Significant additional investment will be necessary to complete the development of any of our products. Pre-clinical and clinical trial work must be completed before our products could be ready for use within the market that we have identified. We may fail to develop any products, to obtain regulatory approvals, to enter clinical trials or to commercialize any products. We do not know whether any of our potential product development efforts will prove to be effective, meet applicable regulatory standards, obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, be capable of being manufactured at a reasonable cost or be accepted in the marketplace. The product candidates we are currently developing are not expected to be commercially viable for several years and we may encounter unforeseen difficulties or delays in commercializing our product candidates. In addition, our products may cause undesirable side effects. 8 Our product candidates require significant funding to reach regulatory approval assuming positive clinical results. Such funding will be very difficult, or impossible to raise in the public markets. If such partnerships are not attainable, the development of these product candidates maybe significantly delayed or stopped altogether. The announcement of such delay or discontinuation of development may have a negative impact on our share price. We may violate one or more of the operational covenants related to our convertible debentures that could result in an event of default and the requirement for early payment of our convertible debentures. Our convertible debentures are subject to certain operational covenants. In the event that one of those covenants is breached by us, an event of default could be declared requiring the immediate payment of the face value of the debentures. This could result in our inability to pay the principal and interest owing on the debentures and insolvency of the Company, a dilutive equity financing in attempt to raise funds to repay the debentures, or a significant reduction in cash available for us to use towards the development of our product candidates. The Company has indemnified Old Lorus and its directors, officers and employees in respect of the Arrangement. Under the Arrangement, we have agreed to indemnify Old Lorus and its directors, officers and employees from and against all damages, losses, expenses (including fines and penalties), other third party costs and legal expenses, to which any of them may be subject arising out of any matter occurring (i) prior to, at or after the effective time of the Arrangement (“Effective Time”) and directly or indirectly relating to any of the assets of Old Lorus transferred to New Lorus pursuant to the Arrangement (including losses for income, sales, excise and other taxes arising in connection with the transfer of any such asset) or conduct of the business prior to the Effective Time; (ii) prior to, at or after the Effective Time as a result of any and all interests, rights, liabilities and other matters relating to the assets transferred by Old Lorus to New Lorus pursuant to the Arrangement; and (iii) prior to or at the Effective Time and directly or indirectly relating to, with certain exceptions, any of the activities of Old Lorus or the Arrangement. This indemnification could result in significant liability to us. We may be unable to obtain partnerships for one or more of our product candidates which could curtail future development and negatively impact our share price. Our strategy for the research, development and commercialization of our products requires entering into various arrangements with corporate collaborators, licensers, licensees and others, and our commercial success is dependent upon these outside parties performing their respective contractual responsibilities. The amount and timing of resources that such third parties will devote to these activities may not be within our control. We cannot assure you that such parties will perform their obligations as expected. We also cannot assure you that our collaborators will devote adequate resources to our programs. In addition, we could become involved in disputes with our collaborators, which could result in a delay or termination of the related development programs or result in litigation. We intend to seek additional collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize some of our products. We may not be able to negotiate collaborative arrangements on favourable terms, or at all, in the future, or that our current or future collaborative arrangements will be successful. If we cannot negotiate collaboration, licence or partnering agreements, we may never achieve profitability. Clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes and Health Canada or the FDA may ultimately not approve any of our product candidates. We may never develop any commercial drugs or other products that generate revenues. 9 None of our product candidates has received regulatory approval for commercial use and sale in North America. We cannot market a pharmaceutical product in any jurisdiction until it has completed thorough preclinical testing and clinical trials in addition to that jurisdiction’s extensive regulatory approval process. In general, significant research and development and clinical studies are required to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates before we can submit any regulatory applications. Clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes. Clinical trials may not be commenced or completed on schedule, and Health Canada or the FDA or any other regulatory body may not ultimately approve our product candidates for commercial sale. The clinical trials of any of our drug candidates could be unsuccessful, which would prevent us from advancing, commercializing or partnering the drug. Even if the results of our preclinical studies or clinical trials are initially positive, it is possible that we will obtain different results in the later stages of drug development or that results seen in clinical trials will not continue with longer term treatment. Positive results in early Phase I or Phase II clinical trials may not be repeated in larger Phase II or Phase III clinical trials. For example, results of our Phase III clinical trial of Virulizin did not meet the primary endpoint of the study despite promising preclinical and early stage clinical data. All of our potential drug candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. Preparing, submitting and advancing applications for regulatory approval is complex, expensive and time intensive and entails significant uncertainty. A commitment of substantial resources to conduct time-consuming research, preclinical studies and clinical trials will be required if we are to complete development of our products. Clinical trials of our products require that we identify and enrol a large number of patients with the illness under investigation. We may not be able to enrol a sufficient number of appropriate patients to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner particularly in smaller indications such as acute myeloid leukemia. If we experience difficulty in enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials, we may need to delay or terminate ongoing clinical trials and will not accomplish objectives material to our success that could affect the price of our common shares. Delays in planned patient enrolment or lower than anticipated event rates in our current clinical trials or future clinical trials may result in increased costs, program delays, or both. In addition, unacceptable toxicities or adverse side effects may occur at any time in the course of preclinical studies or human clinical trials or, if any product candidates are successfully developed and approved for marketing, during commercial use of any approved products. The appearance of any such unacceptable toxicities or adverse side effects could interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates or, if previously approved, necessitate their withdrawal from the market. Furthermore, disease resistance or other unforeseen factors may limit the effectiveness of our potential products. Our failure to develop safe, commercially viable drugs would substantially impair our ability to generate revenues and sustain our operations and would materially harm our business and adversely affect our share price. We may never achieve profitability. As a result of intense competition and technological change in the pharmaceutical industry, the marketplace may not accept our products or product candidates, and we may not be able to compete successfully against other companies in our industry and achieve profitability. Many of our competitors have: • drug products that have already been approved or are in development, and operate large, well-funded research and development programs in these fields; • substantially greater financial and management resources, stronger intellectual property positions and greater manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience; 10 • significantly greater experience than we do in undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials of new or improved pharmaceutical products and obtaining required regulatory approvals; • Consequently, our competitors may obtain Health Canada, FDA and other regulatory approvals for product candidates sooner and may be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we or our collaborators are; • Existing and future products, therapies and technological approaches will compete directly with the products we seek to develop. Current and prospective competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific problem or may offer easier delivery or comparable performance at a lower cost; • Any product candidate that we develop and that obtains regulatory approval must then compete for market acceptance and market share. Our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers and the medical community. Further, any products we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses we incurred in connection with the development of these products. As a result, we may never achieve profitability. If we fail to attract and retain key employees, the development and commercialization of our products may be adversely affected. We depend heavily on the principal members of our scientific and management staff. If we lose any of these persons, our ability to develop products and become profitable could suffer. The risk of being unable to retain key personnel may be increased by the fact that we have not executed long term employment contracts with our employees, except for our senior executives. Our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified scientific and management personnel. We face competition for personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. We may be unable to obtain patents to protect our technologies from other companies with competitive products, and patents of other companies could prevent us from manufacturing, developing or marketing our products. Patent protection The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The United States (U.S.) Patent and Trademark Office and many other patent offices in the world have not established a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that they will allow in biotechnology patents. Allowable patentable subject matter and the scope of patent protection obtainable may differ between jurisdictions. If a patent office allows broad claims, the number and cost of patent interference proceedings in the U.S. or analogous proceedings in other jurisdictions and the risk of infringement litigation may increase. If it allows narrow claims, the risk of infringement may decrease, but the value of our rights under our patents, licenses and patent applications may also decrease. The scope of the claims in a patent application can be significantly modified during prosecution before the patent is issued. Consequently, we cannot know whether our pending applications will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide us with significant proprietary protection or will be circumvented, invalidated or found to be unenforceable. Until recently, patent applications in the U.S. were maintained in secrecy until the patents issued, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. Patent applications filed in the United States after November 2000 generally will be published 18 months after the filing date unless the applicant certifies that the invention will not be the subject of a foreign patent application. In many other jurisdictions, such as Canada, patent applications are published 18 months from the priority date. We cannot assure you that, even if published, we will be aware of all such literature. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that the named inventors of our products and processes were the first to invent that product or process or that we were the first to pursue patent coverage for our inventions. 11 Enforcement of intellectual property rights Protection of the rights revealed in published patent applications can be complex, costly and uncertain. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce our proprietary rights. If third parties engage in activities that infringe our proprietary rights, our management’s focus will be diverted and we may incur significant costs in asserting our rights. We may not be successful in asserting our proprietary rights, which could result in our patents being held invalid or a court holding that the third party is not infringing, either of which would harm our competitive position. Others may design around our patented technology. We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, European opposition proceedings, or other analogous proceedings in other parts of the world to determine priority of invention and the validity of patent rights granted or applied for, which could result in substantial cost and delay, even if the eventual outcome is favourable to us. We cannot assure you that our pending patent applications, if issued, would be held valid or enforceable. Trademark protection In order to protect goodwill associated with our company and product names, we rely on trademark protection for our marks. For example, we have registered the Virulizin® trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A third party may assert a claim that the Virulizin® mark is confusingly similar to its mark and such claims or the failure to timely register the Virulizin® mark or objections by the FDA could force us to select a new name for Virulizin®, which could cause us to incur additional expense. Trade secrets We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality provisions in our agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants to protect our intellectual property. However, these and other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we might be unable to adequately enforce our rights against these people or obtain adequate compensation for the damages caused by their unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets or know how. Our trade secrets or those of our collaborators may become known or may be independently discovered by others. Our products and product candidates may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could increase our costs. Our success also depends on avoiding infringement of the proprietary technologies of others. In particular, there may be certain issued patents and patent applications claiming subject matter which we or our collaborators may be required to license in order to research, develop or commercialize at least some of our product candidates, including Virulizin®, LOR-2040 and LOR-253. In addition, third-parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on our patents or other intellectual property rights. An adverse outcome in these proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third-parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third-parties or require us to cease or modify our use of the technology. If we are required to license such technology, we cannot assure you that a license under such patents and patent applications will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Further, we may incur substantial costs defending ourselves in lawsuits against charges of patent infringement or other unlawful use of another’s proprietary technology. If product liability claims are brought against us or we are unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance, we may incur substantial liabilities that could reduce our financial resources. The clinical testing and commercial use of pharmaceutical products involves significant exposure to product liability claims. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials on humans; however, our insurance coverage may be insufficient to protect us against all product liability damages. Further, liability insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and we might not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us against product liability damages. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in decreased demand for a future product, injury to reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, loss of revenue, costs of litigation, distraction of management and substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs. Additionally, if we are required to pay a product liability claim, we may not have sufficient financial resources to complete development or commercialization of any of our product candidates and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. 12 We have no manufacturing capabilities. We depend on third parties, including a number of sole suppliers, for manufacturing and storage of our product candidates used in our clinical trials. Product introductions may be delayed or suspended if the manufacture of our products is interrupted or discontinued. We do not have manufacturing facilities to produce supplies of LOR-2040, small molecule or any of our other product candidates to support clinical trials or commercial launch of these products, if they are approved. We are dependent on third parties for manufacturing and storage of our product candidates. If we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of our product candidates on acceptable terms, or if we encounter delays or difficulties in the manufacturing process or our relationships with our manufacturers, we may not have sufficient product to conduct or complete our clinical trials or support preparations for the commercial launch of our product candidates, if approved. Our operations involve hazardous materials and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can he expensive and restrict how we do business. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, radioactive compounds and other potentially dangerous chemicals and biological agents. Although we believe our safety procedures for these materials comply with governmental standards, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. We currently have insurance, in amounts and on terms typical for companies in businesses that are similarly situated, that could coverall or a portion of a damage claim arising from our use of hazardous and other materials. However, if an accident or environmental discharge occurs, and we are held liable for any resulting damages, the associated liability could exceed our insurance coverage and our financial resources. Our interest income is subject to fluctuations of interest rates in our investment portfolio. Our investments are held to maturity and have staggered maturities to minimize interest rate risk. We cannot assure you that interest income fluctuations will not have an adverse impact on our financial condition. We maintain all our accounts in Canadian dollars, but a portion of our expenditures are in foreign currencies. We do not currently engage in hedging our foreign currency requirements to reduce exchange rate risk. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON SHARES AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common shares could suffer a decline in value. You should consider an investment in our common shares as risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. We receive only limited attention by securities analysts and frequently experience an imbalance between supply and demand for our common shares. The market price of our common shares has been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile. Factors affecting our common share price include but are not limited to: • the progress of our and our collaborators’ clinical trials, including our and our collaborators’ ability to produce clinical supplies of our product candidates on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities to meet our clinical trial requirements; 13 • announcements of technological innovations or new product candidates by us, our collaborators or our competitors; • fluctuations in our operating results; • published reports by securities analysts; • developments in patent or other intellectual property rights; • publicity concerning discovery and development activities by our licensees; • the cash and short term investments held us and our ability to secure future financing; • public concern as to the safety and efficacy of drugs that we and our competitors develop; • governmental regulation and changes in medical and pharmaceutical product reimbursement policies; and • general market conditions. Future sales of our common shares by us or by our existing shareholders could cause our share price to fall. Additional equity financings or other share issuances by us could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. Sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of our common shares in the public market and the sale of shares issued in connection with strategic alliances, or the perception that such additional sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common shares to drop. Conversion of our secured convertible debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders. The conversion of some or all of our convertible debentures will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders. Any sales in the public market of the common shares issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common shares. In addition, the existence of the secured convertible debentures may encourage short selling by market participants. Item
