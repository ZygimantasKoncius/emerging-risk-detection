ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued In the event Michael Ryan, the Companyâ€™s Chief Executive Officer and President, violates the supervisory restrictions imposed by an SEC Administrative Law Judge, sanctions could be imposed against Mr. Ryan and on the Company. On June 25, 2010, an SEC Administrative Law Judge issued a decision which became effective on August 5, 2010 concerning Mr. Ryan prohibiting him from serving in a supervisory capacity with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AFP and PCS, with the right to reapply after one year. Mr. Ryan has not reapplied for a new supervisory license. Mr. Ryan continues to serve as the President and CEO of the Company. To insure that Mr. Ryan does not violate the supervisory restrictions contained in the decision, our Board of Directors has imposed a restriction on Mr. Ryan that prohibits him from exercising any supervisory authority over PCS and AFP, their activities or representatives, including our employees in their capacity as PCS representatives. Our Board of Directors has delegated to Carole Enisman, Executive Vice President of Operations, any issue that could potentially impact the conduct or employment of a PCS or AFP registered representative in his or her capacity as a PCS or AFP registered representative. Ms. Enisman has been instructed that with respect to any such issue, she reports to our Board of Directors, and not to Mr. Ryan as President of Gilman Ciocia, Inc. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
