Item 1A. Risk Factors The business segments in which we operate are highly competitive. The business segments in which we operate are highly competitive and are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, new housing starts, home repair and remodeling activities, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. Given the commodity nature of our manufactured products, we have little control over market pricing or market demand. No single company is dominant in any of our industries. 8 Table of Contents Our corrugated packaging competitors include large, vertically-integrated paperboard and packaging products companies and numerous smaller companies. Because these products are globally traded commodities, the industries in which we compete are particularly sensitive to price fluctuations as well as other factors, including innovation, design, quality, and service, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our business could be materially adversely affected. Although corrugated packaging is dominant in the national distribution process, our products also compete with various other packaging materials, including products made of paper, plastics, wood, and various types of metal. In the building products markets, we compete with many companies that are substantially larger and have greater resources in the manufacturing of building products. The profitability of our business is affected by changes in raw material and other costs. Virgin wood fiber and recycled fiber are the principal raw materials we use to manufacture corrugated packaging and certain of our building products. We purchase virgin wood fiber in highly competitive, price sensitive markets. The price for wood fiber has historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis and has often depended on a variety of factors over which we have no control, including environmental and conservation regulations, natural disasters, the price and level of imported timber and the continuation of any applicable tariffs, and weather. In addition, the increase in demand for old corrugated containers, especially from China, may cause a significant increase in the cost of recycled fiber used in the manufacture of recycled containerboard and related products. Such costs are likely to continue to fluctuate. While we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining virgin wood fiber and recycled fiber in economic proximity to our facilities, this may not continue to be the case for any or all of our facilities. Our profitability is also sensitive to changes in the prices of energy and transportation. While we have attempted to contain energy costs through internal generation and in some instances the use of by-products from our manufacturing processes as fuel, no assurance can be given that such efforts will be successful in the future or that energy prices will not rise to levels that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We hedge very little of our energy needs. The corrugated packaging and building products industries are cyclical in nature and experience periods of overcapacity. The operating results of our corrugated packaging and building products segments reflect each such industryÂ’s general cyclical pattern. While the cycles of each industry do not historically coincide, demand and prices in each tend to drop substantially in an economic downturn. The building products industry is further influenced by the residential construction and remodeling markets. Further, each industry periodically experiences substantial overcapacity. Both industries are capital intensive, which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover marginal costs. These conditions have contributed to substantial price competition and volatility in these industries, even when demand is strong. Any increased production by our competitors could depress prices for our products. From time to time, we have closed certain of our facilities or have taken downtime based on prevailing market demand for our products and may continue to do so, reducing our total production levels. Certain of our competitors have also temporarily closed or reduced production at their facilities, but can reopen and/or increase production capacity at any time, which could exacerbate the overcapacity in these industries and depress prices. Our manufacturing activities are subject to environmental regulations and liabilities that could have a negative effect on our operating results. Our manufacturing operations are subject to federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment and otherwise related to the protection of the environment. Compliance with these provisions has required us to invest substantial funds to modify facilities to ensure compliance with applicable environmental regulations. In other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we provide 9 Table of Contents certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years. However, we could incur additional significant expenditures due to changes in law or the discovery of new information, and such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Downward changes in demand for housing in the market regions where we operate could decrease profitability in our building products segment. The residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions, including interest rates and availability of financing. Adverse changes in these conditions generally, or in the market regions where we operate, could decrease demand for new homes in these areas. Decline in housing demand could have a negative effect on the pricing and demand for many of our building products, particularly lumber and gypsum wallboard, which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings. If certain internal restructuring transactions and the distributions of Forestar and Guaranty are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. We entered into certain internal restructuring transactions in preparation for the spin-offs of Forestar and Guaranty. These transactions are complex and could cause us to incur significant tax liabilities. We received a private letter ruling from the IRS and opinions of tax counsel regarding the tax-free nature of these transactions and the distributions. The ruling and opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings, from us regarding the past and future conduct of our businesses and other matters. If any of these are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, then we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or opinions and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the ruling and opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the distributions or the internal restructuring transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or if the distributions should become taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock ownership after the distribution. If the sale of our strategic timberland did not qualify for installment method reporting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities the payment of which we believe to be deferred. We sold our strategic timberland in a manner intended for U.S. federal income tax purposes to defer recognition of a substantial portion of the gain on the sale. Under the installment method, we will not be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on the deferred gain until we are required to recognize the gain. We received opinions of tax counsel regarding the timberland sale and the deferred gain. The opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from us regarding the past and future conduct of our businesses and other matters. If any of these are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, then we may not be able to rely on the opinions. Notwithstanding the opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the gain does not qualify for deferral if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the transaction otherwise does not qualify for the installment method. We have interest rate risk in connection with our financial assets and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities. In October 2007, we received $2.38 billion in notes due in 2027 from the sale of our timberland, which we later contributed to two wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. In December 2007, the special purpose entities pledged the notes as collateral for $2.14 billion nonrecourse loans payable in 2027. Both the notes and the borrowings require quarterly interest payments based on variable interest rates that reset quarterly. Because of the differences in references rates, margins, and reset dates, there could be periods in which the interest paid on the nonrecourse financial liabilities is significantly more than the interested received on the financial assets. 10 Table of Contents Item 1B.
