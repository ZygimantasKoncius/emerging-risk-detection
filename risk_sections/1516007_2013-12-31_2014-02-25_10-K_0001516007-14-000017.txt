Item 1A. Risk Factors There are many factors that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and investments in us. Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the discussion of other factors that could affect us or investments in us included elsewhere in this Report. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. These known material risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Risks Inherent in Our BusinessWe may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner, to enable us to continue to pay distributions to our unitholders at the current rate or the minimum quarterly distribution.We may not have sufficient cash each quarter to continue to pay distributions at the current rate or the minimum quarterly distribution. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common and subordinated units principally depends 17Table of Contentsupon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the volumes of crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG we handle;•the storage, throughput and ancillary fees (including margin sharing) with respect to volumes that we handle;•damage to pipelines, facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters or acts of terrorism;•inadvertent damage to pipelines from construction or damage to docks from collision with vessels;•leaks or other accidental releases of products or other materials into the environment, whether as a result of human error or otherwise;•planned or unplanned shutdowns of the refineries and chemical production facilities owned by our customers;•prevailing economic and market conditions; •difficulties in collecting our receivables because of credit or financial problems of our customers;•the effects of new or expanded environmental and occupational health and safety regulations;•compliance with governmental regulations, including changes in governmental regulation of the industries in which we operate;•changes in tax laws; •weather conditions; and •force majeure events. In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution depends on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:•the level of capital expenditures we make; •the cost of acquisitions; •our debt service requirements and other liabilities; •fluctuations in our working capital needs; •our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets; •restrictions contained in debt agreements to which we are a party; and•the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner.Our business would be adversely affected if the operations of our customers experienced significant interruptions. In certain circumstances, the obligations of many of our key customers under their terminal services agreements may be reduced or suspended, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent upon the uninterrupted operations of certain facilities owned or operated by our customers, such as the refineries and chemical production facilities we serve. Any significant interruption at these facilities or inability to transport products to or from these facilities or to or from our customers for any reason would adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to our unitholders. Operations at our facilities and at the facilities owned or operated by our suppliers and customers could be partially or completely shut down, temporarily or permanently, as the result of any number of circumstances that are not within our control, such as:•failure to acquire or maintain necessary governmental permits or other approvals;•catastrophic events, including fires, explosive incidents and hurricanes; •environmental remediation; •labor difficulties; •disruptions in the supply of products to or from our facilities; and•terrorist attacks and acts of sabotage targeting oil and gas production facilities, refineries, processing plants, terminals and other infrastructure facilities. 18Table of ContentsOur terminal services agreements with many of our key customers provide that, if any of a number of events occur, including certain of those events described above, which we refer to as events of force majeure, and the event significantly delays or renders performance impossible with respect to a facility, usually for a specified minimum period of days, our customers’ obligations would be temporarily suspended with respect to that facility. In that case, a significant customer’s fixed storage services fees may be reduced or suspended, even if we are contractually restricted from recontracting out the storage space in question during such force majeure period, or the contract may be subject to termination. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured against such risks. As a result, our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Our financial results depend on the demand for the crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG that we transport, store and distribute, among other factors.Any sustained decrease in demand for crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG in the markets served by our terminals could result in a significant reduction in storage or throughput levels at our terminals, which would reduce our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. Our financial results may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within certain regions. If economic and market conditions are uncertain or adverse conditions occur, we may experience material impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Other factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand include: •the impact of weather on demand for oil; •the level of domestic oil and gas production, both on a stand-alone basis and as compared to the level of foreign oil and gas production;•higher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase, directly or indirectly, the cost of gasoline;•an increase in automotive engine fuel economy, whether as a result of a shift by consumers to more fuel-efficient vehicles or technological advances by manufacturers;•the increased use of alternative fuel sources, such as ethanol, biodiesel, solar and fuel cells and the increased use of electric and battery-powered engines; and•an increase in the market price of crude oil that leads to higher refined petroleum product prices, which may reduce demand for refined petroleum products and drive demand for alternative products. Market prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to changes in global and regional supply that are beyond our control, and increases in the price of crude oil may result in a lower demand for refined petroleum products.Any decrease in supply and marketing activities may result in reduced throughput volumes at our terminals, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.A decrease in the volume of LPG transported across our docks, or a decrease in the margin our LPG customer receives subject to our margin sharing arrangement, could negatively impact the throughput revenues we earn. In March 2013, we announced the expansion of our relationship with Enterprise and the construction of an additional dock to increase our ability to handle imports and exports of LPG and other products at our facility on the Houston Ship Channel. Pursuant to this arrangement, we participate in margin sharing with Enterprise on vessels loaded at our Houston facility. Initially, we only participated in margin sharing on specified vessels, but beginning in January 2014, we began participating in margin sharing on all customer vessels loaded at our Houston facility under the arrangement. In January 2014, we announced a further expansion of our terminal service agreement with Enterprise, which, among other things, increased the dock capacity we made available to Enterprise and extended the term of the agreement to 50 years. During the year ended December 31, 2013, our throughput revenues increased 173.8% as compared to the prior year. A significant proportion of the increase was attributable to amounts we received under the LPG margin sharing arrangement. We do not have direct commodity exposure under the margin sharing arrangement, but throughput revenue 19Table of Contentswe receive on qualifying vessels under this arrangement is determined based on: (i) the volumes of LPG transported across our docks and (ii) the margin Enterprise receives on those volumes.The number and types of vessels scheduled for loading at our facility, along with pricing to be received for LPG delivery, are determined exclusively by Enterprise and are beyond our control. In addition, during the term of the agreement, we agreed to an exclusivity provision for vessel-based LPG import and export services encompassing all of the U.S. Gulf Coast, resulting in a concentration of our LPG import and export business with a single customer. If Enterprise decreases the volume of scheduled LPG exports at our Houston facility or the margin it receives declines, our throughput revenues received under the arrangement would be lower. Moreover, if global LPG supply and demand economics shift or if other LPG import and export facilities are constructed that compete with our facility, the volume of imports loaded at our Houston facility and the margin received by Enterprise on LPG exports at our Houston facility could decline. These factors could lead to lower realized throughput revenues than we have received in prior periods.Revenues we generate from throughput fees vary based upon the volumes of products handled at our terminals and the activity levels of our customers. Any short- or long-term decrease in the demand for the crude oil, refined petroleum products or LPG we handle or any interruptions to the operations of certain of our customers, could reduce the amount of cash we generate and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.For the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated approximately 38% of our revenues from throughput fees, which our non-storage customers pay us to receive or deliver volumes of products on their behalf to designated pipelines, third-party storage facilities or waterborne transportation and our storage customers pay us to receive volumes of products on their behalf exceeding the throughput contemplated by their storage agreement with us. Throughput fees are also earned in connection with the volume of products loaded or unloaded across our docks, and may be in the form of a fixed throughput fee rate or based upon the margins earned by the customer. In addition, approximately 29% of our total revenues were generated from throughput fees charged to a single customer.The revenues we generate from throughput fees vary based upon the volumes of products received at or delivered from our terminals, and our non-storage customers are not obligated to pay us throughput fees unless we move volumes of products across our pipelines or docks on their behalf. If one or more of our non-storage customers were to slow or suspend its operations, or otherwise experience a decrease in demand for our services, our revenues under our agreements with such customers would be reduced or suspended, resulting in a decrease in the revenues we generate.Reduced volatility in energy prices or new government regulations could discourage our storage customers from holding positions in crude oil or refined petroleum products, which could adversely affect the demand for our storage services.We have constructed and continue to construct new storage facilities in response to increased customer demand for storage. Many of our competitors have also built new storage facilities. The demand for new storage has resulted, in part, from our customers’ desire to have the ability to take advantage of profit opportunities created by volatility in the prices of crude oil and petroleum products. If the prices of crude oil and petroleum products become relatively stable, or if federal and/or state regulations are passed that discourage our customers from storing those commodities, demand for our storage services could decrease, in which case we may be unable to renew contracts for our storage services or be forced to reduce the rates we charge for our storage services, either of which would reduce the amount of cash we generate.Some of our current terminal services agreements automatically renew on a short-term basis, and may be terminated at the end of the current renewal term upon requisite notice. If one or more of our current terminal services agreements is terminated and we are unable to secure comparable alternative arrangements, our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.Some of our terminal services agreements currently in effect are operating in the automatic renewal phase of the contract that begins upon the expiration of the primary contract term. Our terminal services agreements have primary contract terms that range from one to 50 years. Upon expiration of the primary contract term, these agreements may renew automatically for successive renewal terms that range from one to five years unless earlier terminated by either 20Table of Contentsparty upon the giving of the requisite notice, generally ranging from three to 18 months prior to the expiration of the applicable renewal term. If any one or more of our terminal services agreements is terminated and we are unable to secure comparable alternative arrangements, we may not be able to generate sufficient additional revenue from third parties to replace any shortfall in revenue or increase in costs. Additionally, we may incur substantial costs if modifications to our terminals are required by a new or renegotiated terminal services agreement. The occurrence of any one or more of these events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.There are a number of significant expansion projects of other companies that are expected to be completed within the next few years that could impact demand for our services.We believe that current and planned pipeline expansion projects of other companies will introduce significant new crude oil supplies to the Gulf Coast through proposed pipeline projects that, if approved and completed as expected, could transport nearly 3.5 million barrels of crude oil per day into and throughout the region by the end of 2015. These or other pipeline construction projects have resulted in pipeline-delivered crude oil accounting for a growing share of the crude oil supplies utilized by our customers, causing a decrease in waterborne foreign crude imports by our customers. As a result, our excess waterfront capacity created by this shift is increasingly being used for exports. However, to the extent we are unable to utilize excess capacity caused by decreasing imports, we may not be able to realize the full value of our waterfront assets.In addition, a number of other companies have announced plans to construct or expand export infrastructure within the next few years to accommodate increasing exports of LPG. These additional infrastructure projects may compete with the LPG export facilities that we are in the process of expanding with Enterprise. For more information on our LPG expansion projects, see “Item 1. Business — 2013 and Recent Developments — LPG Export Terminal Agreement and Dock Expansion Project.” If the construction of LPG export infrastructure outpaces growth in LPG production and export, we may not be able to realize the full value of our LPG expansion projects.Competition from other terminals that are able to supply our customers with comparable storage capacity at a lower price could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We face competition from other terminals that may be able to supply our customers with integrated terminaling services on a more competitive basis. We compete with national, regional and local terminal and storage companies, including major integrated oil companies, of varying sizes, financial resources and experience. Our ability to compete could be harmed by factors we cannot control, including:•our competitors’ construction of new assets or redeployment of existing assets in a manner that would result in more intense competition in the markets we serve;•the perception that another company may provide better service; and•the availability of alternative supply points or supply points located closer to our customers’ operations.Any combination of these factors could result in our customers utilizing the assets and services of our competitors instead of our assets and services, or us being required to lower our prices or increase our costs to retain our customers, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders.Our expansion of existing assets and construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and will be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.A portion of our strategy to grow our business and increase distributions to unitholders is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets. The construction of a new terminal, or the expansion of an existing terminal, such as by increasing storage capacity or otherwise, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, most of which are beyond our control. Moreover, we may not receive sufficient long-term contractual commitments from customers to provide the revenue needed to support such projects. As a result, we may construct new facilities that are not able to attract enough storage customers or throughput to achieve our expected 21Table of Contentsinvestment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost. We may be unable to negotiate acceptable interconnection agreements with third-party pipelines to provide destinations for increased throughput. Even if we receive sufficient multi-year contractual commitments from customers to provide the revenue needed to support such projects and we complete our construction projects as planned, we may not realize an increase in revenue for an extended period of time. For instance, if we build a new terminal, the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth would be limited, and any acquisitions we make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash generated from operations on a per unit basis.A portion of our strategy to grow our business and increase distributions to unitholders is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in our cash available for distribution per unit. If we are unable to make acquisitions, including from OTA and its affiliates, because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts, we are unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or we are outbid by competitors, our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited. Furthermore, even if we do consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, they may in fact result in a decrease in our cash available for distribution per unit. Any acquisition involves potential risks, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:•mistaken assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;•an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;•an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our business and newly acquired assets;•the assumption of unknown liabilities; •limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; •mistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;•the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;•unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and•customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.Because our assets are exclusively located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, our ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected.We rely exclusively on sales generated from products distributed from the terminals we own, which are exclusively located in the Gulf Coast region. Due to our lack of diversification in asset type and location, an adverse development in these businesses or areas, including adverse developments due to catastrophic events or weather and decreases in demand for refined petroleum products, could have a significantly greater impact on our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders than if we maintained more diverse assets and locations.We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers could adversely affect our financial results and cash available for distribution.We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. Approximately 62% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 were attributable to our five largest customers. Our credit 22Table of Contentsprocedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use the capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.Restrictions in our debt agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Under our loan agreements with OT Finance, we are prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness from third parties without the approval of OT Finance. In addition, these loan agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain debt, leverage and equity ratios and prohibit us from pledging our assets to third parties. Our revolving line of credit with OT Finance contains similar financial covenants that could restrict our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. As a result, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.Any reduction in the capability of our customers to utilize third-party pipelines that interconnect with our terminals, or to continue utilizing them at current costs, could cause a reduction of volumes transported through our terminals.Many users of our terminals are dependent upon connections to third-party pipelines, to receive and deliver crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG. Any interruptions or reduction in the capabilities of these interconnecting pipelines due to testing, line repair, reduced operating pressures, or other causes would result in reduced volumes transported through our terminals. Similarly, if additional shippers begin transporting volume over interconnecting pipelines, the allocations to our existing shippers on these interconnecting pipelines could be reduced, which also could reduce volumes transported through our terminals. Allocation reductions of this nature are not infrequent and are beyond our control. In addition, if the costs to us or our storage service customers to access and transport on these third-party pipelines significantly increase, our profitability could be reduced. Any such increases in cost, interruptions or allocation reductions that, individually or in the aggregate, are material or continue for a sustained period of time could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Mergers among our customers and competitors could result in lower volumes being stored in or distributed through our terminals, thereby reducing the amount of cash we generate.Mergers between our existing customers and our competitors could provide strong economic incentives for the combined entities to utilize their existing systems instead of ours in those markets where the systems compete. As a result, we could lose some or all of the volumes and associated revenues from these customers and we could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes and revenues. Because most of our operating costs are fixed, a reduction in volumes would result not only in less revenue, but also a decline in cash flow of a similar magnitude, which would adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our ability to pay cash distributions.Some of our storage tanks and portions of our pipeline system have been in service for several decades.Our pipeline and storage assets are generally long-lived assets. As a result, some of those assets have been in service for many decades. The age and condition of these assets could result in increased maintenance or remediation expenditures and an increased risk of product releases and associated costs and liabilities. Any significant increase in these expenditures, costs or liabilities could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our ability to pay cash distributions.Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions, including interruptions from hurricanes or floods, for which we may not be adequately insured.Our primary operations are currently all located in the Gulf Coast region, and are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions, including interruptions from hurricanes or floods, which have historically impacted the 23Table of Contentsregion with some regularity. Each of our Houston and Beaumont terminals, for example, has experienced damage and interruption of business due to hurricanes. We may also be affected by factors such as adverse weather, accidents, fires, explosions, hazardous materials releases, mechanical failures, disruptions in supply infrastructure or logistics and other events beyond our control. In addition, our operations are exposed to other potential natural disasters, including tornadoes, storms, floods and/or earthquakes. Moreover, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG emissions in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our related operations.We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business. Certain of our insurance policies that are under the global insurance program administered by Oiltanking GmbH provide coverage to affiliated entities in the Oiltanking Group that we do not own. This allocation may result in limiting the amount of recovery available to us for purposes of covered losses.Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and could escalate further. In addition sub-limits have been imposed for certain risks. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to unitholders.We may incur significant costs and liabilities in complying with stringent environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations.Our operations involve the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG and are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the release of materials into the environment, occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with this complex array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations is difficult and may require significant capital expenditures and operating costs to mitigate or prevent pollution. Moreover, our business is subject to accidental spills, discharges or other releases of refined petroleum products or crude oil, hazardous substances or wastes into the environment and neighboring areas, in which events joint and several, strict liability may be imposed against us under certain environmental laws for costs required to remediate and restore impacted properties, for claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury, natural resource and property damages, and for costs required to conduct health studies. Failure to comply with applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, and permit revocations, the imposition of investigatory, corrective action, or remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations.New laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, increased government enforcement or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. We are not able to predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations or how such legal requirements are interpreted or enforced, but any such expenditures or costs for environmental and occupational health and safety compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.We could incur significant costs and liabilities in responding to contamination that occurs at our facilities.There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes, because of air emissions, water discharges and waste practices related to our operations, and as a result of historical operations and waste disposal practices of prior owners of our facilities. Our pipeline and terminal facilities have been used for transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, refined petroleum products or crude oil, hydrocarbons, hazardous 24Table of Contentssubstances and wastes from time to time have been spilled or released on or under the terminal properties. In addition, the terminal properties were previously owned and operated by other parties and those parties from time to time also have spilled or released refined petroleum products or crude oil, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes. The terminal properties are subject to federal, state and local laws that impose investigatory, corrective action and remedial obligations, some of which are joint and several or strict liability obligations without regard to fault, to address and prevent environmental contamination. We may incur significant costs and liabilities in responding to any soil and groundwater contamination that occurs on our properties, even if the contamination was caused by prior owners and operators of our facilities. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance or other sources of contractual indemnity. To the extent that the costs associated with meeting any or all of these requirements are substantial and not adequately provided for, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating and capital costs and reduced demand for our storage services.The EPA has adopted rules for establishing a reporting program for emissions of GHGs from specified large GHG emissions sources in the United States and subsequently expanded the scope of this rule to include the reporting of GHG emissions from onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. Operators of covered sources in the United States must annually monitor and report these GHG emissions to specified governmental agencies, with operators in Texas reporting to the EPA. Certain of our facilities may become subject to the federal GHG reporting requirements because of combustion GHG emissions and potential fugitive emissions that exceed reporting thresholds. To the extent we are required to comply with this reporting program, it increases our operating costs.Following its determination in December 2009 that emissions of GHGs present a danger to public health and the environment, the EPA promulgated regulations establishing Title V and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) permitting reviews for certain large stationary sources that are potential major sources of GHGs emissions. In the absence of any control requirements for GHGs for our facilities that would need to be incorporated into existing Title V permits, we believe the impact of these permitting requirements on our facilities will not be material. However, we may be required to install “best available control technology” to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs. Best available control technology is determined on a case-by-case basis by the relevant permitting agency. Our experience has been that PSD permits with GHG emissions limitations have generally required efficient combustion requirements on sources that burn large volumes of fossil fuels rather than post-combustion GHG capture requirements. Consequently, to the extent that the EPA imposes efficient combustion requirements, we do not anticipate that they will have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations. While the federal Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation in the U.S., a number of states, excluding Texas, and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions. Two of the more significant non-federal GHG programs are the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”) located in the Northeast United States, and California’s cap-and-trade program. We currently do not conduct operations in California or the areas covered by RGGI. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, demand for our services, results of operations and cash flows.Finally, should Congress undertake comprehensive tax reform, it is possible that such reform will include a carbon tax. A carbon tax could impose additional direct costs on our operations and reduce demand for refined products. The ultimate impact of any carbon tax on our operations would further depend upon whether a carbon tax supplanted the other federal GHG regulations to which we are currently subject or is administered as an additional program. 25Table of ContentsTerrorist attacks or other security threats aimed at our facilities or surrounding areas could adversely affect our business.The U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically the nation’s pipeline and terminal infrastructure, may be the future targets of terrorist organizations. In addition to the threat of terrorist attacks, we face various other security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any terrorist attack at our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines, refineries or terminals could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business, and the failure of any critical information system may result in harm to our business. We are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include data network and telecommunications, internet access and our websites, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our pipelines and terminals. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented measures, such as virus protection software, intrusion detection systems and emergency recovery processes to address the outlined risks. However, security measures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe. Any compromise of our data security or our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business and subject us to additional costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Finally, federal legislation relating to cyber-security threats may be enacted that could impose additional requirements on our operations. Risks Relating to Our StructureOTA owns and controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our general partner and its affiliates, including OTA, have conflicts of interest with us and limited fiduciary duties, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders.OTA owns and controls our general partner and appoints all of the directors of our general partner. Although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders, the executive officers and directors of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to OTA. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between OTA and its affiliates, including our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:•our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as OTA, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders;•neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires OTA to pursue a business strategy that favors us;•our partnership agreement limits the liability of and reduces fiduciary duties owed by our general partner and also restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;•except in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval; 26Table of Contents•our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and the level of cash reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;•our general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditure and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. Our partnership agreement does not set a limit on the amount of maintenance capital expenditures that our general partner may incur. This determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders which, in turn, may affect the ability of the subordinated units to convert;•our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units, to make incentive distributions or to accelerate the expiration of the subordination period;•our partnership agreement permits us to distribute up to $30.0 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, non-working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions on our subordinated units or the IDRs;•our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with its affiliates on our behalf;•our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;•our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units;•our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us;•our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us; and•our general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our general partner’s IDRs without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner or the unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to the common unitholders in certain situations.In addition, we may compete directly with entities in which OTA has an interest for acquisition opportunities and potentially will compete with these entities for new business or extensions of the existing services provided by us.Our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations.Our general partner intends to limit its liability under contractual arrangements so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our general partner or its assets. Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner’s fiduciary duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.We expect that we will distribute all of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement) to our unitholders and will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings, borrowings from OT Finance and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow. 27Table of ContentsIn addition, because we distribute all of our available cash, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement or in our revolving line of credit on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.Our general partner’s board of directors’ absolute discretion in determining our level of cash reserves may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Our partnership agreement requires our general partner’s board of directors to deduct from available cash the amount of any cash reserves that in its reasonable discretion are necessary to fund our future operating expenditures. In addition, the partnership agreement permits our general partner’s board of directors to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners. Any such cash reserves will reduce the amount of cash currently available for distribution to our unitholders.The amount of estimated maintenance capital expenditures our general partner is required to deduct from operating surplus each quarter could increase in the future, resulting in a decrease in available cash from operating surplus that could be distributed to our unitholders. Our partnership agreement requires our general partner to deduct from operating surplus each quarter estimated maintenance capital expenditures as opposed to actual maintenance capital expenditures in order to reduce disparities in operating surplus caused by fluctuating maintenance capital expenditures. Our annual estimated maintenance capital expenditures for purposes of calculating operating surplus is approximately $8.5 million for 2014. This amount is based on our current estimates of the amounts of expenditures we will be required to make in the future to maintain our long-term operating capacity, which we believe to be reasonable. Our partnership agreement does not cap the amount of maintenance capital expenditures that our general partner may estimate. The amount of our estimated maintenance capital expenditures may be more than our actual maintenance capital expenditures, which will reduce the amount of available cash from operating surplus that we would otherwise have available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount of estimated maintenance capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by the board of directors of our general partner at least once a year, with any change approved by the conflicts committee. In addition to estimated maintenance capital expenditures, reimbursement of expenses incurred by our general partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of available cash from operating surplus that we would otherwise have available for distribution to our unitholders. Our partnership agreement limits our general partner’s fiduciary duties to holders of our common and subordinated units.Our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify and reduce the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our general partner may make in its individual capacity include:•how to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;•whether to exercise its limited call right; •how to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;•whether to exercise its registration rights; •whether to elect to reset target distribution levels; and 28Table of Contents•whether to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or any amendment to the partnership agreement.By purchasing a common unit, a unitholder is treated as having consented to the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above. Our partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our common and subordinated units for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.Our partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that:•whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;•our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning that it believed that the decision was in the best interests of our partnership;•our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal; and•our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its fiduciary duties to us or our limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:(1)approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval;(2)approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates;(3)on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties; or(4)fair and reasonable to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by our general partner must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee and the board of directors of our general partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the affiliate transaction or conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in subclauses (3) and (4) above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.OTA and other affiliates of our general partner may compete with us.Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will be restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as our general partner and those activities incidental to its ownership interest in us. Affiliates of our general partner, including OTA and the Oiltanking Group, are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us. The Oiltanking Group and OTA currently hold substantial interests in other companies in the terminaling business. OTA and the Oiltanking Group make investments and purchase entities that acquire, own and operate terminaling businesses. These investments and 29Table of Contentsacquisitions may include entities or assets that we would have been interested in acquiring. Therefore, OTA and the Oiltanking Group may compete with us for investment opportunities and OTA and the Oiltanking Group may own an interest in entities that compete with us.Pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our general partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors and OTA. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our general partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders.Our general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to its IDRs, without the approval of the conflicts committee of its board of directors or the holders of our common units. This could result in lower distributions to holders of our common units.Our general partner has the right, at any time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled (48.0%, in addition to distributions paid on its 2.0% general partner interest) for each of the prior four consecutive whole fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our cash distributions at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election by our general partner, the minimum quarterly distribution will be adjusted to equal the reset minimum quarterly distribution, and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on the same percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution as the current target distribution levels.If our general partner elects to reset the target distribution levels, it will be entitled to receive a number of common units and a general partner interest necessary to maintain its general partner interest in us immediately prior to the reset election. The number of common units to be issued to our general partner will equal the number of common units which would have entitled the holder to an average aggregate quarterly cash distribution in such prior two quarters equal to the average of the distributions to our general partner on the IDRs in the prior two quarters. We anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion. It is possible, however, that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or expects to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its IDRs and may, therefore, desire to be issued common units rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience a reduction in the amount of cash distributions that our common unitholders would have otherwise received had we not issued new common units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels.Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors, which could reduce the price at which our common units trade.Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. Our unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our general partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our general partner, including the independent directors, is chosen entirely by OTA, as a result of it owning our general partner, and not by our unitholders. Unlike publicly traded corporations, we do not conduct annual meetings of our unitholders to elect directors or conduct other matters routinely conducted at annual meetings of stockholders of corporations. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. 30Table of ContentsEven if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they cannot remove our general partner without its consent.If our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they will have limited ability to remove our general partner. Unitholders will be unable to remove our general partner without its consent because our general partner and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all our outstanding common and subordinated units voting together as a single class is required to remove our general partner. OTA owns, directly or indirectly, an aggregate of 66.0% of our common and subordinated units. Also, if our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and no units held by the holders of our subordinated units or their affiliates are voted in favor of that removal, all remaining subordinated units will automatically be converted into common units and any existing arrearages on the common units will be extinguished. Cause is narrowly defined in our partnership agreement to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-appealable judgment finding our general partner liable for actual fraud or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner. Cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business.Our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the members of our general partner to transfer their respective membership interests in our general partner to a third party. The new members of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner with their own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions taken by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner. This effectively permits a “change of control” without the vote or consent of the unitholders.Our general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price equal to the greater of (i) the average of the daily closing price of the common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three days before notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (ii) the highest per-unit price paid by our general partner or any of its affiliates for common units during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our general partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the limited call right. There is no restriction in our partnership agreement that prevents our general partner from issuing additional common units and exercising its call right. If our general partner exercised its limited call right, the effect would be to take us private and, if the units were subsequently deregistered, we would no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. OTA owns, directly or indirectly, an aggregate of 36.1% of our common units. At the end of the subordination period, assuming no additional issuances of units (other than upon the conversion of the subordinated units), OTA will own 66.0% of our common units.We may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:•our existing unitholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;•the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease; 31Table of Contents•because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase;•the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;•the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and•the market price of the common units may decline. The market price of our common units could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common units in the public or private markets, including sales by OTA or other large holders.We have 22,049,901 common units and 19,449,901 subordinated units outstanding. All of the 19,449,901 subordinated units will convert into common units on a one-for-one basis at the end of the subordination period. Sales by OTA or other large holders of a substantial number of our common units in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common units or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities. In addition, we have provided registration rights to OTA. Under our partnership agreement, our general partner and its affiliates have registration rights relating to the offer and sale of any units that they hold, subject to certain limitations. Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.Our partnership agreement restricts unitholders’ voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter.Payments due to our general partner and its affiliates for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount and timing of such payments will be determined by our general partner.Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse our general partner and its affiliates pursuant to the Services Agreement. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us but does not otherwise limit the amount of expenses for which our general partner and its affiliates may be compensated. Under the Services Agreement, we have an agreed upon fixed fee associated with certain specified selling, general and administrative services necessary to run our business that are provided to us by OTA. These expenses include expenses of non-executive employees, including general and administrative overhead costs, salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other compensation amounts and executive officer expenses, including general and administrative overhead costs, salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other compensation amounts. The compensation for expenses and payment of fees to our general partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of available cash to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. The amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which may prevent us from making cash distributions during periods when we record net income.The amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow, including cash flow from reserves and working capital or other borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may pay cash distributions during periods when we record net losses for financial accounting purposes and may not pay cash distributions during periods when we record net income.While our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash, our partnership agreement, including provisions requiring us to make cash distributions contained therein, may be amended.While our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash, our partnership agreement, including provisions requiring us to make cash distributions contained therein, may be amended. Our partnership 32Table of Contentsagreement generally may not be amended during the subordination period without the approval of our public common unitholders. However, our partnership agreement can be amended with the consent of our general partner and the approval of a majority of the outstanding common units (including common units held by OTA) after the subordination period has ended. OTA owns, directly or indirectly, approximately 36.1% of the outstanding common units and all of our outstanding subordinated units. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions and in certain circumstances may be personally liable for the obligations of the partnership.Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (“Delaware Act”), we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. A purchaser of units who becomes a limited partner is liable for the obligations of the transferring limited partner to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the purchaser of units at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the partnership agreement. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.It may be determined that the right, or the exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group, to (i) remove or replace our general partner, (ii) approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or (iii) take other action under our partnership agreement constitutes “participation in the control” of our business. A limited partner that participates in the control of our business within the meaning of the Delaware Act may be held personally liable for our obligations under the laws of Delaware, to the same extent as our general partner. This liability would extend to persons who transact business with us under the reasonable belief that the limited partner is a general partner. Neither our partnership agreement nor the Delaware Act specifically provides for legal recourse against our general partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability through any fault of our general partner. The NYSE does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our general partner’s board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders will not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.Tax Risks to Unitholders Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to material additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced.The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a “qualifying income” requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. Failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%. Distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate 33Table of Contentsdistributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our common unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. Our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us. At the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise, or other forms of taxation. Imposition of a similar tax on us in the jurisdictions in which we operate or in other jurisdictions to which we may expand could substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to you.The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time, members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. One such legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly-traded partnerships as corporations upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be reintroduced or will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if the unitholder does not receive any cash distributions from us.Unitholders will be required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability which results from that income.Oiltanking Beaumont Specialty Products, LLC (“OTBSP”), one of our subsidiaries, conducts activities that may not generate qualifying income. If the income generated by this subsidiary disproportionately increases as a percentage of our total gross income, we may choose to have this subsidiary treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.In order to maintain our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 90% or more of our gross income in each tax year must be qualifying income under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. A small portion of our current business relates to the transportation and storage of specialty products that may not generate qualifying income. In an attempt to ensure that 90% or more of our gross income in each tax year is qualifying income, we conduct the portion of our business related to these specialty products in OTBSP. Currently, this subsidiary represents approximately 5% of our total gross income. If the income generated by this subsidiary disproportionately increases as a percentage of our total gross income, we may choose to have this subsidiary treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, this subsidiary would be subject to corporate-level tax on its taxable income at the applicable federal corporate income tax rate (currently, 35%). Imposition of a corporate level tax would reduce the anticipated cash available for distribution to us from OTBSP’s assets and operations and, in turn, would reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Moreover, if the IRS were to successfully assert that this subsidiary had more tax liability than we currently anticipate or legislation was enacted that increased the corporate tax rate, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be further reduced. 34Table of ContentsThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.We will be considered to have terminated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. OTA owns, directly and indirectly, more than 50% of the total interests in our capital and profits interests. Therefore, a transfer by OTA of all or a portion of its interests in us could result in a termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in us filing two tax returns for one calendar year and could result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than the calendar year, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in the unitholder’s taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but it would result in our being treated as a new partnership for federal income tax purposes. If we were treated as a new partnership, we would be required to make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS recently announced a relief procedure whereby if a publicly-traded partnership that has technically terminated requests and the IRS grants special relief, among other things, the partnership may be permitted to provide only a single Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the two short tax periods included in the year in which the termination occurs.Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.If you sell your common units, you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of your allocable share of our net taxable income result in a decrease in your tax basis in your common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units you sell will, in effect, become taxable income to you if you sell such units at a price greater than your tax basis in those units, even if the price you receive is less than your original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if you sell your units, you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale.Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.Investments in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as “IRAs”), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Allocations and/or distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest applicable effective tax rate applicable to non-U.S. persons, and each non-U.S. person will be required to file U.S. federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. If you are a tax-exempt entity or a non-U.S. person, you should consult your tax advisor before investing in our common units.If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders.The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. Our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution. 35Table of ContentsWe treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from your sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns.We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. Nonetheless, we allocate certain deductions for depreciation of capital additions based upon the date the underlying property is placed in service. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed Treasury Regulations that proved a safe harbor pursuant to which a publicly-traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, the proposed regulations do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our proration method or new Treasury Regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among our unitholders.A unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of common units) may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.Because there are no specific rules governing the U.S. tax consequences of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, he may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units.
