ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued Our common stock is thinly traded, and therefore not as liquid as other investments. The trading volume of our common stock on NASDAQ is consistently “thin,” in that there is not a great deal of trading activity on a daily basis. Because the average active trading volume is thin, there is less opportunity for shareholders to sell their shares of our common stock on the open market, resulting in the common stock being less liquid than common stock in other publicly traded companies. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
