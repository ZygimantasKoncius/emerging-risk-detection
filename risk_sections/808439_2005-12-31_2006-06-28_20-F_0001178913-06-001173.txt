D. RISK FACTORS INVESTING IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES. OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DUE TO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS. IN THAT CASE, THE VALUE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES COULD DECLINE, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATING CONDITIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH IN TURN CAN AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operating results are impacted by general industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing costs. Our operating results are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production and/or the retirement of older aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as the level of U.S. and Israeli government appropriations for defense (as further discussed below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns, and changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. A REDUCTION IN MILITARY BUDGETS WORLDWIDE MAY CAUSE A REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUES, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of products for military applications. These revenues totaled approximately $14.67 million, or 29.8% of revenues in 2005, $13.7 million, or 41.2% of revenues in 2004 and $15.2 million, or 49.5% of revenues, in 2003. In recent years the military budgets of a number of countries have been reduced and may be further reduced in the future. Declines in military budgets may result in reduced demand for our products and manufacturing services. Any decline could result in reduction in our core business revenues and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 2 WE DERIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR REVENUES FROM SEVERAL MAJOR CUSTOMERS. IF WE LOSE ANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS OR THEY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS THEY DO WITH US, OUR REVENUES MAY BE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED. One of our governmental customers accounted for approximately 11.1% of our revenues in 2005. Four customers accounted for a total of approximately 26.3% and 44.9% of our revenues in 2005 and 2004 respectively, and four customers accounted for approximately 50.2% of our revenues in 2003. These customers may not maintain the same volume of business with us in the future. If we lose any of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with us, our revenues may be seriously affected. A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR REVENUES ARE FROM CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. AND ISRAELI GOVERNMENTS AND IS SUBJECT TO SPECIAL RISKS. A LOSS OF ALL, OR A MAJOR PORTION, OF OUR REVENUES FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. A substantial portion of our revenues are from contracts with the U.S. and Israeli governments. Sales to the U.S. and Israeli governments, accounted for approximately 11.1% and 1.7% of our revenues for 2005, 10.6% and 2.6% of our revenues for 2004, and approximately 15.3% and 3.3% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively. Business with the U.S. and Israeli governments, as well as with the governments of other countries, is subject to risks which are not as relevant in business with private parties. For example: o legislative or administrative requirements may delay payment for performance of contracts; o our sales to government agencies, authorities and companies are directly affected by these customers' budgetary constraints and the priority given in their budgets to the procurement of our products; o since these contracts are generally terminable-at-will, a government may terminate contracts for its convenience, because of a change in its requirements, policies or budgetary constraints, or as a result of a change in the administration; and o our costs may be adjusted as a result of audits or we may have increased or unexpected costs causing losses or reduced profits under fixed-price contracts. WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THESE COMPONENTS WHEN NEEDED, WE WOULD EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We acquire most of the components for the manufacture of our products from a limited number of suppliers, most of whom are located in Israel and the United States. Certain of these suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more components upon which we are dependent. Suppliers of some of these components require us to place orders with significant lead-time to assure supply in accordance with our requirements. Inadequacy of operating funds may cause us to delay placement of such orders and may result in delays in supply. Delays in supply may significantly hurt our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations and may significantly hurt our business and results of operations. We may not be able to continue to obtain such components from these suppliers on satisfactory commercial terms. 3 WE MAY FACE INCREASED COSTS AND A REDUCED SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOUP ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS OR IN ELECTRIC POWER COSTS FOR OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH PRICE INCREASES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. Since 2003, the cost of raw materials used in our production has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions. The cost of electric power used in our operations has also increased in the last several years. We may not be able to recoup any future increases in the cost of raw materials or electric power costs through price increases for our products. WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE FIELD. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OFFER OUR PRODUCTS AS PART OF INTEGRATED SYSTEMS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS OUR COMPETITORS OR SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP OR INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE MORE COST EFFECTIVE OR OFFER BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The market for heat exchangers and other heat transfer products is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively in our market. Our principal competitors are Honeywell Corporation, or Honeywell, Hamilton Sunstrand, or Hamilton, Triumph Group Inc, or Triumph, Lytron Incorporated, or Lytron, and Niagara Thermal. Some of our competitors are far larger, have substantially greater resources, including technical, financial, research and development, marketing and distribution capabilities than we have, and enjoy greater market recognition. These competitors may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and may be less vulnerable to price competition than us. We may not be able to offer our products as part of integrated systems to the same extent as our competitors or successfully develop or introduce new products that are more cost effective or offer better performance than those of our competitors. Failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE PIEDMONT IN THE FUTURE. IF PIEDMONT IS UNSUCCESSFUL, OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. On July 7, 2005, our subsidiary, Limco-Airepair, purchased Piedmont, an FAA certified company based in Kernersville, North Carolina, that is engaged in the repair and overhaul of various aircraft accessories. Under the terms of the acquisition, we paid $5.34 million for Piedmont, including acquisition costs, and repaid $11 million of its outstanding indebtedness. In 2004 and in 2003, Piedmont had revenues of $27,485,315 and $23,881,884 and a net loss of $168,234 and net income of $135,093, respectively. In the six month period ended December 31, 2005, Piedmont had revenues of $16,259,503 and a net income of $872,573. We may not be successful in maintaining profitable operations of Piedmont in the future. If Piedmont is not profitable in the future, we may lose our investment in this company and our future results of operations will be adversely affected. WE MAY ENGAGE IN FUTURE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DILUTE OUR STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND HARM OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. We have pursued, and will continue to pursue, growth opportunities through internal development and acquisition of complementary businesses, products and technologies. We are unable to predict whether or when any other prospective acquisition will be completed. The process of integrating an acquired business may be prolonged due to unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources and management's attention. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, integrate acquired businesses into our operations, or expand into new markets. Further, once integrated, acquisitions may not achieve comparable levels of revenues, profitability or productivity as our existing business or otherwise perform as expected. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. 4 Future acquisitions may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing. Future acquisitions by us could result in the following, any of which could seriously harm our results of operations or the price of our ordinary shares: o issuance of equity securities that would dilute our current shareholders' percentages of ownership; o large one-time write-offs; o the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; o difficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired companies; o diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; o contractual disputes; o risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience; and o potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations. RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. The aerospace market in which we compete is subject to technological changes, introduction of new products, change in customer demands and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend upon our ability to keep pace with technological developments and to timely address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and new technologies and by developing and introducing enhancements to our current products and new products. We may not be able to successfully develop and market enhancements to our products that will respond to technological change, evolving industry standards or customer requirements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of such enhancements; and such enhancements may not meet the requirements of the market or achieve any significant degrees of market acceptance. If release dates of our new products or enhancements are delayed, or if when released, they fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. WE FACE SPECIAL RISKS FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES OPERATIONS AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS. ONE OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE REVENUES AND, AS A RESULT, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. Our international sales and operations, including exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. 91.6% of our sales in 2005, 84.7% of our sales in 2004 and 84.4% of our sales in 2003 resulted from our international operations. This subjects us to many risks inherent in international business, including: currency exchange fluctuations, limitations and disruptions resulting from the imposition of government controls, changes in regulatory requirements, export license requirements, economic or political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs, currency fluctuations, longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection, difficulties in managing overseas subsidiaries and international operations and potential adverse tax consequences. 5 We may not be able to sustain or increase revenues from international operations or we may encounter significant difficulties in connection with the sale of our products in international markets or one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and, as a result, our business, operating results and financial condition. IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE THE GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR THE EXPORT OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR REVENUES MAY DECREASE. SIMILARLY IF OUR SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR GOVERNMENT APPROVALS NECESSARY TO EXPORT THEIR PRODUCTS OR DESIGNS TO US, OUR REVENUES MAY DECREASE AND WE MAY FAIL TO IMPLEMENT OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. Under Israeli law, the export of certain of our products and know-how is subject to approval by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. To initiate sales proposals with regard to exports of our products and know-how and to export such products or know-how, we must obtain permits from the Ministry of Defense. We may not be able to receive in a timely manner all the required permits for which we may apply in the future. Similarly, under foreign laws the export of certain military products, technical designs and spare parts require the prior approval of, or export license from, such foreign governments. In order to maintain our third party production, certain co-development activities and procurements required for the performance of certain contracts, we must receive detailed technical designs, products or product parts' samples from our strategic partners or suppliers. We may not be able to receive all the required permits and/or licenses in a timely manner. Consequently, our revenues may decrease and we may fail to implement our growth strategy. FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our governmental contracts are generally fixed price contracts. In addition, we have fixed contracts with commercial airlines such as Lufthansa and KLM. Under fixed price contracts, the price is not subject to adjustment by reason of the costs incurred in the performance of the contracts. Accordingly increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profits or generate a loss. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL, WHOSE LOSS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Our future success depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and key personnel. We do not carry key-person life insurance on our senior management or key personnel. Any loss of the services members of senior management or other key personnel could negatively and materially affect our business. COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGING REGULATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. As a result of changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, the costs of being a public company in general have increased in recent years. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices. We expect that the on-going implementation of these regulations will further increase our legal compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result of such developments. When we are required to implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which governs internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, we will need to expend significant management time and financial resources to comply with the applicable requirements. This and other proposed legislation may increase the fees of our professional advisors and our insurance premiums. 6 RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR ORDINARY SHARES OUR SHARE PRICE HAS BEEN VOLATILE IN THE PAST AND MAY DECLINE IN THE FUTURE. Our ordinary shares have experienced significant market price and volume fluctuations in the past and may experience significant market price and volume fluctuations in the future in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control: o quarterly variations in our operating results; o operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; o changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; o announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; o changes in the status of our intellectual property rights; o announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us; o additions or departures of key personnel; o future sales of our ordinary shares; o de-listing of our shares from the NASDAQ Capital Market; and o stock market price and volume fluctuations. Domestic and international stock markets often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations or political events or hostilities in or surrounding Israel, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 7 SUBSTANTIAL FUTURE SALES OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES BY OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS MAY DEPRESS OUR SHARE PRICE. Our principal shareholders, TAT Industries and T.O.P, Limited Partnership, or T.O.P hold 51.70% and 22.46% of our outstanding ordinary shares. If they sell substantial amounts of our ordinary shares, including shares issued upon the exercise of options, or if the perception exists that our principal shareholders may sell a substantial number of our ordinary shares, the market price of our ordinary shares may fall. Any substantial sales of our shares in the public market also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time, in a place and on terms we deem appropriate. RISKS RELATING TO OUR LOCATION IN ISRAEL BECAUSE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN ISRAEL, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS AFFECTING ISRAEL THAT COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS. We are incorporated under the laws of, and our executive offices, manufacturing plant and research and development facilities are located in, the State of Israel. As a result, we are directly affected by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Specifically, we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving Israel, a full or partial mobilization of the reserve forces of the Israeli army, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and a state of hostility, varying from time to time in intensity and degree, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since September 2000, there has been a marked increase in violence, civil unrest and hostility, including armed clashes, between the State of Israel and the Palestinians, and acts of terror have been committed inside Israel and against Israeli targets in the West Bank and Gaza. These developments have adversely affected the regional peace process, placed the Israeli economy under significant stress, and have negatively influenced Israel's relationship with several Arab countries. In August 2005, Israel evacuated all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and four settlements in the West Bank. In January 2006, Hamas won the elections in the Palestinian Authority and as a result the diplomatic relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority have worsened. The implications of these developments cannot at this time be foreseen. Any future armed conflict, political instability or violence in the region may have a negative effect on our business condition, harm our results of operations and adversely affect our share price. Furthermore, there are a number of countries that restrict business with Israel or Israeli companies. Restrictive laws or policies of those countries directed towards Israel or Israeli businesses had, and may in the future continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, our financial results or the expansion of our business. No predictions can be made as to whether or when a final resolution of the area's problems will be achieved or the nature thereof and to what extent the situation will impact Israel's economic development or our operations. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE OBLIGATION OF OUR PERSONNEL IN ISRAEL TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. Many of our executive officers and employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances. If a military conflict or war arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or a significant number of other employees due to military service. Any disruption in our operations could adversely affect our business. 8 WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A CHANGE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE NIS AGAINST THE DOLLAR. BECAUSE EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE NIS AND THE DOLLAR FLUCTUATE CONTINUOUSLY, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY LARGER PERIODIC DEVALUATIONS, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR PROFITABILITY AND PERIOD TO PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR RESULTS. Because exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar fluctuate continuously, exchange rate fluctuations, particularly larger periodic devaluations, may have an impact on our profitability and period to period comparisons of our results. In 2001, 2002 and 2005 the rate of devaluation of the NIS against the dollar was 9.3%, 7.3% and 6.8 %, respectively, while in 2003 and 2004 the NIS appreciated in value in relation to the dollar by 7.6% and 1.6%, respectively. A portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses, is incurred in NIS and a part of our revenues are quoted in NIS. Additionally, certain assets, as well as a portion of our liabilities, are denominated in NIS. Our results may be adversely affected by the devaluation of the NIS in relation to the dollar (or if such devaluation is on lagging basis), if our revenues in NIS are higher than our expenses in NIS and/or the amount of our assets in NIS are higher than our liabilities in NIS. Alternatively, our results may be adversely affected by an appreciation of the NIS in relation to the dollar (or if such appreciation is on a lagging basis), if the amount of our expenses in NIS are higher than the amount of our revenues in NIS and/or the amount of our liabilities in NIS are higher than our assets in NIS. SERVICE AND ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL PROCESS ON US AND OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. Service of process upon our directors and officers and the Israeli experts named herein, all of whom reside outside the United States, may be difficult to obtain within the United States. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets, all of our directors and officers and the Israeli experts named in this annual report are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against us or these individuals or entities may not be collectible within the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in original actions instituted in Israel. However, subject to certain time limitations and other conditions, Israeli courts may enforce final judgments of United States courts for liquidated amounts in civil matters, including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of those Acts. PROVISIONS OF ISRAELI LAW MAY DELAY, PREVENT OR MAKE THE ACQUISITION OF OUR COMPANY DIFFICULT, WHICH COULD PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL AND THEREFORE DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES. Provisions of Israeli corporate and tax law may have the effect of delaying, preventing or making more difficult a merger with, or other acquisition of, us. This could cause our ordinary shares to trade at prices below the price for which third parties might be willing to pay to gain control of us. Third parties who are otherwise willing to pay a premium over prevailing market prices to gain control of us may be unable or unwilling to do so because of these provisions of Israeli law. 9 YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS A SHAREHOLDER WILL BE GOVERNED BY ISRAELI LAW AND DIFFER IN SOME RESPECTS FROM THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF SHAREHOLDERS UNDER U.S. LAW. We are incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by our memorandum of association, articles of association and by Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. In particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith in exercising his or her rights and fulfilling his or her obligations toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing his power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters. Israeli law provides that these duties are applicable in shareholder votes on, among other things, amendments to a company's articles of association, increases in a company's authorized share capital, mergers and interested party transactions requiring shareholder approval. In addition, a controlling shareholder of an Israeli company or a shareholder who knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or who has the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or executive officer in the company has a duty of fairness toward the company. However, Israeli law does not define the substance of this duty of fairness. Because Israeli corporate law has undergone extensive revision in recent years, there is little case law available to assist in understanding the implications of these provisions that govern shareholder behavior. AS A FOREIGN PRIVATE ISSUER WHOSE SHARES ARE LISTED ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET, WE MAY FOLLOW CERTAIN HOME COUNTRY CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES INSTEAD OF CERTAIN NASDAQ REQUIREMENTS. As a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on the NASDAQ National Market, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, including the composition of our Board of Directors, director nomination procedure, compensation of officers, distribution of annual reports to shareholders, and quorums at shareholders' meetings. In addition, we may follow Israeli law instead of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules that require that we obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as for the establishment or amendment of certain equity based compensation plans, an issuance that will result in a change of control of our company, certain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in our company and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company.
