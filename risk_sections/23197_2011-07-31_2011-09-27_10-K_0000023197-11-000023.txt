ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning the future of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of our products, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” the negative of these terms, or other similar words or comparable terminology. All statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking information. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form 10-K. However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our business outlook, actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Our 2012 and future business outlook and operating results are difficult to forecast, are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile. We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share from period-to-period. For instance, a large portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifier segments’ net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers, respectively, that generally have short-lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. The remaining portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are generally derived from large contracts or military program opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and therefore difficult to predict. As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, our mobile data communications segment will experience a material decline in revenues and related operating income in fiscal 2012. In addition, we are currently in the process of repositioning our mobile data communications segment’s business strategies, the outcome of which is difficult to predict. Our new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, may vary significantly from period-to-period because of other factors including: the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions and revenue recognition; product mix sold; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general economic conditions. Changes in government policy, including changes in U.S. policies relating to Iraq and Afghanistan could have a material adverse effect on us. In past years, we have benefited from increased Department of Defense (“DoD”) spending relating to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. There can be no assurance that this trend will continue. The U.S. government has issued policies related to Iraq and Afghanistan that include formal troop withdrawals and reductions. We believe such policy changes resulted in a reduction of orders we received in fiscal 2011 and that historical spending patterns, for the types of communication products that we sell, are no longer meaningful when estimating future product demand. These policies or future changes in these or other policies or priorities could have a negative impact on our business and results of operation. A shifting political environment makes it more difficult than usual to estimate our future income and expenses. The future direction of the political environment, including potential changes in policies relating to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 18 The continued effects of the adverse global economic climate could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook, our business, operating results and financial condition. We participate in the global commercial and government communications markets, which are characterized by rapid technological advances and constant changes. For the past few years, our customers and the end markets that we serve have been significantly impacted by adverse global economic conditions. The impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. These conditions have already resulted in (i) changes to our commercial and government customers’ historical spending priorities, (ii) reduced military budgets and (iii) extreme pressures on government budgets throughout the world. In addition to operating in a difficult global economic environment, some of our end customers are located in emerging countries that are currently undergoing sweeping political changes. In the past few months, European monetary issues and concerns have intensified and it is possible that a worldwide credit crisis could occur. We believe that the aggregation of these conditions has resulted in the current suppression of end-market demand for many of the products that we sell and services that we provide. Although we believe that we will ultimately experience long-term growth, these adverse conditions could last for many years. We believe that nearly all of our customers will continue to face capital and operating budget constraints and a much tighter credit environment. None of our three operating segments have been immune to these adverse conditions and each continues to face an uncertain economic environment. These adverse conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including: · Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations – It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity, or the duration, of the current adverse economic environment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate. · Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur – Our businesses have been negatively affected, both currently and in the past, by uncertain economic environments both in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. These reductions have impacted all three of our business segments. The overall business environment remains challenging. As a result of the ongoing difficult global economic environment, our customers may further reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact all three of our business segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, revenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill. · Our customers may not be able to obtain financing – Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers’ ability to obtain the sufficient financing they may require to build out their networks, fund operations and ultimately make purchases from us. Our customers’ inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our revenues. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations. · Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult – In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain and might require higher deductibles than in the past. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain adequate credit insurance consistent with our past practices. 19 Our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depend on our ability to obtain future business with the U.S. government. In past years, our business has depended, in large part, on U.S. government business. Our sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) accounted for approximately 61.7%, 71.1% and 56.4% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Approximately 59.3% of our backlog at July 31, 2011 consisted of orders from U.S. government contracts, U.S. government subcontracts and U.S. government funded programs. Our U.S. government business exposes us to various risks, including: · unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions; · unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations; · reductions in government funds available for our projects due to government policy changes, budget cuts and other spending priorities; · higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; and · unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates. All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government’s right to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary spending. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. Also, we obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable. Government contract audits could have an adverse financial impact on us. All of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”) and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. For example, in May 2011, we were informed by the DCAA that it selected our BFT-1 contract for a post-award audit. Through July 31, 2011, we received $343.9 million in total funded orders under our BFT-1 contract. Ultimately, if the DCAA determines that a price adjustment for our BFT-1 contract is appropriate, we may be required to refund certain costs previously reimbursed to us by the U.S. government, with interest. These amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments’ responses thereto, and threats of war could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. 20 Reductions in spending or changes in spending priorities to reduce the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) budget and the U.S. Government’s debt could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that the budget for the U.S. DoD will be reduced from current levels over the next decade. In addition to debt reduction efforts already authorized, it is possible that the U.S. government could reduce or further delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, government programs which we participate in. Recently enacted debt-ceiling legislation requires reductions of approximately $350 billion in Pentagon and national security agency budgets over the next ten years. Further, if the Joint House and Senate Select Committee on Deficit Reduction is unsuccessful in reaching an agreement on a deficit reduction plan by late November 2011, the recently enacted debt-ceiling legislation requires significant cuts in federal spending, which would result in further reductions to defense budgets and which could likely have a negative impact our 2012 business outlook. Although the types of communications products and services we offer appear to be a funding priority over the long term, a significant decline in defense spending or a shift in funding priorities may have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows depending on the platforms and programs affected by such budget reductions or shifts in funding priorities. Ultimately, the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments, declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, we may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. We face increased risks associated with our strategies to reposition our mobile data communications segment. As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we expect a material decline in revenues and related operating income in our mobile data communications segment. As a result, we have initiated targeted actions to align our cost structure and are in the process of refining our mobile data communications segment’s business strategies. Despite the award of BFT-2 to a third party competitor, we intend to continue to work cooperatively with the U.S. Army and support their planned transition to BFT-2. We also intend to participate in any potential BFT-3 surveys or proposals. We believe that by seeking to work collaboratively with the U.S. Army to ensure that its short-term and long-term needs are addressed, we will enhance our competitive positioning for a potential new award in the future. Ultimately, we may not be successful and our business outlook would be negatively impacted. We currently intend to continue our efforts in establishing a leadership position in the microsatellite industry. We offer both government and commercial customers the design and production of microsatellites that provide a portion of the functionality of expensive large satellites but at a fraction of the cost. We have established a modest position in this market. We also expect to continue to market and develop our non-MTS and BFT-1 solutions in a methodical way. In the past, we have demonstrated that there a number of opportunities for us to market our products and solutions to other potential customers whose needs would be well met by our technology offerings. In addition, in connection with our partnership with Thuraya Telecommunications Co., a satellite services operator, we have been developing a maritime terminal to provide high-quality voice and broadband services to commercial marine vessels. Sales of our mobile data communications segment’s non-MTS and BFT-1 related products and services have historically not been material. Our future success in further developing these markets will depend on, among other things, our ability to access effective distribution channels, the development or licensing of applications which provide us a competitive advantage, and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. In addition, because we intend to invest only modest amounts in marketing, sales and research and development efforts, we may not be able to penetrate these markets in a significant way. The repositioning of our mobile data communications segment has also resulted in increased employee turnover, both voluntary and involuntary. The future success of our repositioning will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Because of the increased turnover and competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to reposition and operate profitably. If are unable to attract and retain the personnel we will need, our repositioning may ultimately not be successful. 21 Noncompliance with numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions (including those pertaining to income taxes) could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business operations are primarily located in the U.S.; however, we must comply with domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions. Our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. Because the laws and regulations pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following: · We could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government – As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security and contracting practices. Failure to comply with these procurement regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes for disqualification are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of costs, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The government could investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our contract-related costs and fees. Depending on the results of these audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us and, if it were to prevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us. · Adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products – Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocation and availability of the frequency spectrum, and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially harm our business. · We may be subject to environmental liabilities – We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the RoHS directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. · Tax audits could result in a material tax assessment – Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our tax returns for fiscal year 2004 through 2009 were recently audited by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and we may be audited in the future. Although adjustments relating to our settlements for fiscal 2004 through 2009 federal tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 22 Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, further deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure. As of July 31, 2011, we have goodwill and intangible assets of $182.8 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of which $133.5 million and $49.2 million relates to our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifier segments, respectively, and $0.1 million relates our mobile data communications segment. For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, each of our three operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the reporting unit. We perform an annual impairment review in the first quarter of each fiscal year, unless there are other indicators of impairment. Based on our annual impairment review performed as of August 1, 2011, we concluded that our RF microwave amplifiers and our telecommunications transmission reporting units had an estimated fair value in excess of total asset book value of approximately 78.0% and 6.0%, respectively. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment and is based on how our President and Chief Executive Officer manages the business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our future reporting structure, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. If global conditions continue to deteriorate from current levels, or if the market value of our equity or assets significantly declines, or we are not successful in achieving our expected sales levels, or if other events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable, our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired. Although we performed our fiscal 2012 impairment testing on August 1, 2011 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill, changes in our future operating performance or business conditions, in general, could result in an impairment of goodwill in future operating periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change requiring us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully. We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies such as TDMA-based technologies and the emergence of new industry standards such as WiMAX could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly, and our business position depends, in large part, on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development, either through internal research and development or acquisitions of businesses or licenses, of new or enhanced products and technologies. We may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party who maintains patents associated with the technology. As discussed in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note (14)(c) Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings and Other Matters” included in “Part II — Item 8. — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” we are a party to a lawsuit involving this technology. A significant technological breakthrough by others, including smaller competitors or new firms, or an unsuccessful outcome of defending our rights to licensed technologies, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 23 Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses. Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following: · If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs will unexpectedly increase – Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and report on management’s assessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. · Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock – Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. Since fiscal 2006, we have applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. The adoption of the standard had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards. The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. · Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs – The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes resulted in increased costs and as we grow, we expect to see our costs increase. The SEC has passed, promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement to use the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as “XBRL”) in our financial statements, which we began including in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). We may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with IFRS requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) has revised its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers. 24 We could be adversely affected if we violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). In the past, we have reported violations of ITAR to the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (“DDTC”) of the U.S. Department of State. We recently had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance certain policies and procedures including establishing a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. The DDTC closed their review of our compliance with ITAR without assessing any fines or penalties. We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with ITAR and related regulations. We may be subjected to ITAR compliance audits in the future that may not be successful and could result in an unfavorable outcome which could cause actual results to differ materially or adversely from those anticipated. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction against us. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks, including U.S. export restrictions. Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 30.2%, 22.9% and 32.1% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others: · We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk – We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries, in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government. · We rely on a limited number of international sales agents – In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations. · We may not be able to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government – Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses and failure to obtain required licenses would adversely affect our sales outside the U.S. 25 We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption. Our telecommunications transmission segment designs and manufactures our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past. Our RF microwave amplifiers segment manufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, close to major earthquake fault lines and also manufactures amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our mobile data communication segment’s network operations center located in Germantown, Maryland), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions. In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Company-wide, we depend on our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, which is part of our telecommunications transmission segment, to manufacture for all three of our business segments. Intersegment sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 by the telecommunications transmission segment to the RF microwave amplifiers segment were $3.8 million, $7.2 million and $14.6 million, respectively. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment to the mobile data communications segment were $37.0 million, $82.2 million and $53.0 million, respectively. We intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on all three of our business segments, results of operations and financial condition. In the past, the U.S. government experienced delays in the receipt of certain components that are ultimately provided to us for incorporation into our satellite transceivers that we ship to the U.S. government. If we do not receive these or other government furnished components in a timely manner, we could experience delays in fulfilling orders from our customers. Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. We can give no assurance that our backlog will result in net sales. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition. 26 Our MTS and BFT-1 business activities are subject to a number of unique risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition to the other risks described in this section, the risks applicable to our MTS and BFT-1 business activities include the following: · Our 2012 Business Outlook could be volatile given the uncertainties related to BFT-1– Sales for MTS and BFT-1 products and services in fiscal 2011 were approximately $248.6 million and our business outlook assumes a material decline in such revenues in fiscal 2012. As further described below, given the various uncertainties related to our MTS and BFT-1 business activities, our operating results in fiscal 2012 and beyond are likely to be more volatile and it will be more difficult than in the past to accurately project gross margins and our related operating income, net income and earnings per share in any particular future period. Our ability to accurately predict MTS and BFT-1 business activities in fiscal 2012 and beyond is subject to new contracts, contract extensions, contract ceilings, unpredictable funding, as well as deployment and technology decisions by the U.S. government. · Our BFT-1 contract is nearing its expiration and we may not receive any additional orders – We currently provide MTS and BFT-1 products and services pursuant to our existing BFT-1 contract. This contract currently expires on December 31, 2011 and we are committed to providing MTS related services through December 31, 2011 and BFT-1 services through March 31, 2012. Our current BFT-1 contract is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contract and we can receive additional orders of $40.1 million before the current contract ceiling of $384.0 million is reached. Because this contract is an IDIQ contract, it can be terminated at any time and the U.S. Army is not obligated to purchase any additional equipment or services. If we do not receive a contract ceiling increase, a contract extension or are not awarded a new contract, we will not generate any additional revenues in the future and it would have a material adverse effect on our business outlook. · Our negotiations to obtain additional BFT-1 business may not be successful – In July 2010, we were advised by the U.S. Army Contracting Command-CECOM Contracting Center that we were not selected as the vendor for the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below, Blue Force Tracking-2 (“BFT-2”) program. The U.S. Army has indicated to us that it may require certain MTS and BFT-1 sustaining network engineering related services beyond March 31, 2012. Because we were not selected as the vendor for the BFT-2 program, we have limited visibility into the U.S. Army’s transition plans. During our initial negotiations to obtain a multi-year sustainment contract, the U.S. Army indicated that it may begin to purchase future satellite network transponder capacity directly, as early as calendar year 2012. We have informed the U.S. Army that if it proceeds on that basis, we intend to begin charging it a separate fee for the use of our intellectual property. We engaged a national valuation firm to assist us in determining the estimated value of our intellectual property and based on that valuation, we provided a price quote to the U.S. Army. Given the current pressures on the U.S. defense budget and the lack of visibility that we have into the U.S. Army’s plans, we are not able to accurately predict the extent, if any, that we will be able to successfully negotiate a reasonable price for our intellectual property. If we are not successful in negotiating with the U.S. Army, we may not be able to generate any additional MTS or BFT-1 revenues beyond the orders that we currently have in backlog. · Our BFT-1 revenue and related earnings are dependent on third-party products or components – A significant portion of our mobile data communications segment revenues in fiscal 2012 are expected to be derived from sales of leased satellite capacity. We purchase satellite airtime and other products and services from third-party suppliers and incorporate them into our BFT-1 solutions which we sell to the U.S. Army. Our revenues and profitability are highly dependent on the ability of our satellite network providers to provide sufficient network capacity, reliability and security to our customers. If our satellite network providers were to increase the prices of their services, or to suffer operational or technical failures, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. · We may incur material expenses if our BFT-1 network experiences downtime or fails – All satellite communications are subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural disaster may interrupt service and our network systems occasionally experience downtime. Interruptions in service could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Should we be required to obtain or restore service on another system in the event of a satellite failure, our costs could increase which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 27 Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks. A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth. These risks include: · The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business – Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel, particularly the key engineers at our subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or noncompetition agreements. Our expected long-term growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify. · We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth – Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage this growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. · Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success – The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours. 28 Future acquisitions and investments may divert our resources and management attention, and the benefits from such acquisitions and investments may fall short of expectations. We intend to continue pursuing acquisitions or investments in businesses, technologies and product lines. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of additional debt, increases to amortization expenses and the future write-off of intangibles acquired. Such acquisitions or investments may also conflict with our $150.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”), thereby limiting our ability to draw on the Credit Facility or requiring us to repay the Credit Facility. Acquisitions involve other operational risks, including: · difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including the loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business; · diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and · increased expenses associated with acquired businesses including managing the growth of such businesses. There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions and investments will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions that could limit our ability to implement our business plan. We have a committed $150.0 million, unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of bank lenders that expires on January 31, 2014. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability to incur debt, make certain payments (including dividends), repurchase shares of our common stock, sell certain assets, and make certain investments. It also requires us to maintain certain minimum levels of Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) (as defined in the Credit Facility) and does not allow us to permit our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to exceed certain ratios. Our Credit Facility, as amended, also contains certain events of default, including: failure to make payments, failure to perform or observe terms, or a change of control (as defined in the agreement). If an event of default occurs, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings, if any, to be immediately due and payable together with accrued interest and fees. These restrictions and covenants may limit our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in certain strategic transactions. In addition, if we fail to meet the covenants contained in our Credit Facility, our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility may be restricted. If we have significant borrowings under the agreement and we violate a covenant or an event of default occurs and the lenders accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings and terminate their commitment to make future loans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants or that any covenant violations will be waived. In addition, if we fail to comply with our financial or other covenants, we may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish our indebtedness. In the future, we may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at the annual targeted level, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. In September 2010, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend on shares of our common stock with an annual dividend target of $1.00 per common share. Pursuant to this authorization, we paid $20.1 million of cash dividends to our shareholders during fiscal 2011. In September 2011, our Board of Directors raised our annual targeted dividend from $1.00 per common share to $1.10 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to continue to pay annual dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. 29 Protection of our intellectual property is limited and we are subject to the risk that third parties may claim our products or systems infringe their intellectual property rights. Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. Historically, patents have not been an important part of the protection of our intellectual property rights as competitors routinely develop similar but non-infringing products. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition and restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. We believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently contemplated. For example, our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party who maintains the patent. As discussed in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note (14)(c) Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings and Other Matters” included in “Part II — Item 8. — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” we are a party to a lawsuit involving this technology. If the technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required to change our business practices, license the protected technology, and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party and/or our customers who have incorporated our products into their systems or businesses. If we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our business practices, we could be prohibited from making and selling some of our products or providing certain telecommunications services. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our chief executive officer and agreements with other of our executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech. 30 Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. Our 3.0% convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances (such as the declaration of cash dividends on our common stock) and contain certain restrictions and covenants. We can provide no assurances that we will not default on these or other debt obligations. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the 3.0% convertible senior notes on or after May 5, 2014. Holders of the 3.0% convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding 3.0% convertible senior notes, solely for cash, on May 1, 2014, May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2024 and upon certain events, including a change in control. If not redeemed by us or repaid pursuant to the holders’ right to require repurchase, the 3.0% convertible senior notes mature on May 1, 2029. If the holders of our 3.0% convertible senior notes require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding notes that they own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the 3.0% convertible senior notes or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance them. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt; make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. Our stock price is volatile. The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the Risk Factors section and include, among others: · strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures; · issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities; · future announcements concerning us or our competitors; · receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services; · quality deficiencies in services or products; · results of technological innovations; · new commercial products; · changes in recommendations of securities analysts; · government regulations; · changes in the status or outcome of government audits; · proprietary rights or product or patent litigation; · changes in U.S. government policies; · changes related to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan; · changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector; · changes in securities market conditions, generally; · changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters); · energy blackouts; · acts of terrorism or war; · inflation or deflation; and · rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices. Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
