Item 1A. Risk Factors Our results could be affected by the risk factors discussed below. These factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward-looking statements in our Managements Discussion and Analysis. Investors should consider these factors in reading this document. If deteriorating economic conditions alter the frequency and severity patterns utilized in our estimates for reserves for losses, we may be required to take additional charges to earnings. We calculate our best estimate of the reserve for losses to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims on loans reported in default, and loans in default that are in the process of being reported to us, as of the date of our financial statements. Our reserving process incorporates various components in a model that gives effect to current economic conditions and segments defaults by a variety of criteria. The criteria include, among others, policy year, lender, geography and the number of months and number of times the policy has been in default, as well as whether the defaults were underwritten as flow business or as part of a structured bulk transaction. Frequency and severity are the two most significant assumptions in the establishment of our loss reserves. Frequency is used to estimate the ultimate number of paid claims associated with the current defaulted loans. The 19 Table of Contents frequency estimate assumes that long-term historical experience, taking into consideration criteria such as those described in the preceding paragraph, and adjusted for current economic conditions that we believe will significantly impact the long-term loss development, provides a reasonable basis for forecasting the number of claims that will be paid. Severity is the estimate of the dollar amount per claim that will be paid. The severity factors are estimates of the percent of the risk in force that will be paid. The severity factors used are based on an analysis of the severity rates of recently paid claims, applied to the risk in force of the loans currently in default. The frequency and severity factors are updated quarterly. The estimation of loss reserves requires assumptions as to future events, and there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these assumptions. Economic conditions that have affected the development of loss reserves in the past may not necessarily affect development patterns in the future in either a similar manner or degree. To the extent that possible future adverse economic conditions such as increasing unemployment rates or declining housing prices alter those historical frequency and severity patterns, actual paid claims on the existing delinquent loans may be greater than the reserves that we have provided and require a charge to earnings. Since, consistent with industry practice, we generally provide reserves only for loans in default that have been reported to us and an estimate of loans in default not yet reported to us, any increase in the level of delinquent loans reported would require an increase to reserves and a charge to earnings. Reserves are provided for the estimated ultimate costs of settling claims on both loans reported in default and loans in default that are in the process of being reported to us. Generally accepted accounting principles preclude us from establishing loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default. We generally do not establish reserves until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two payments when due. A prolonged deterioration of general economic conditions such as increasing unemployment rates or declining housing prices could adversely alter the historical delinquency patterns resulting in an increase in the level of loans in default. An increase in the number of loans in default would require additional reserves and a charge to earnings as they are reported to us. Because our business is concentrated among relatively few major lenders, our revenues and net income could decline if we lose a significant customer. Our business depends on a relatively small number of customers. During 2006, our top ten lenders were responsible for 80% of our Primary flow new insurance written, compared to 77% in 2005. Additionally, our top three lenders were responsible for approximately 65% of our Primary flow new insurance written during 2006. This concentration of business could increase as a result of further consolidation in the lending industry or other factors. The loss of business from one or more of our major lenders could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If housing values fail to appreciate or decline on a more significant and larger geographic basis, we may incur a higher level of losses from paid claims and also be required to increase reserves. A component of our mitigation efforts on mortgage insurance claims is our option of paying the coverage percentage in full satisfaction of our obligations under the policy or paying off the entire loan amount and taking title to the mortgaged property underlying a defaulted loan. The critical assumption behind the purchase option is that the property has appreciated in value since the loan was originated and that we will be able to recover some, or the entire amount at risk, through the acquisition and subsequent sale of the property. The purchase option proved successful during the first three quarters of 2006 in mitigating losses, but was less successful in the fourth quarter of 2006. The assumptions utilized in our reserve methodology have factored in a certain amount of loss mitigation resulting from the utilization of the purchase option. If housing values fail to appreciate or decline on a more significant and larger geographic basis, the frequency of loans going into default and eventually to a paid claim could increase and our ability to mitigate our losses on defaulted mortgages may be further reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 20 Table of Contents Because a growing portion our business is sensitive to interest rates, a large increase in rates would cause higher monthly mortgage payments for borrowers that could potentially lead to a greater number of defaults, which would adversely impact our business. At December 31, 2006, approximately 30% of our Primary risk in force and 69% of our Modified Pool risk in force is comprised of adjustable-rate mortgage loans or ARMs. Monthly payments on these loans are altered periodically through an adjustment of the interest rate. Many ARMs have a fixed interest rate for a stated period of time, and accordingly, have not yet been subject to an interest rate adjustment. In periods of rising interest rates, a borrowers monthly payment will increase. A large increase in interest rates over a short period of time could lead to payment shocks for borrowers that could potentially lead to more reported defaults. At December 31, 2006, approximately 12% of our Primary risk in force and 13% of our Modified Pool risk in force is comprised of pay option ARMs with the potential for negative amortization on the loan. These percentages have grown substantially over the past year. These loans allow borrowers, for a stated period of time, to make monthly payments that do not cover the interest on the loan meaning the loan balance will increase. These pay option ARM loans may have a heightened propensity to default because of possible payment shocks after the initial low-payment period expires and because the borrower does not automatically build equity through loan amortization as payments are made. The risk of default may be further increased if the interest rate paid during the payment option period is significantly below current market rates. Additionally, it is important to note the lack of long-term historical performance data associated with pay option ARMs across all market conditions, could increase the volatility of the estimates used in our reserve models. If interest rates increase causing payment shock to borrowers with ARMs, our default rate could increase which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. The premiums we charge for mortgage insurance on non-prime loans, ARMs and Alt-A loans may not be adequate to compensate for future losses from these products. Our new insurance written includes non-prime loans, ARMs and Alt-A loans that have an increased premium over prime, fixed rate and fully documented loans. The credit quality, loss development and persistency on these loans can vary significantly from our traditional prime loan business. For example, we have experienced a 3.64% delinquency rate on our Primary Alt-A loan portfolio compared to a 2.47% delinquency rate on our overall Primary loan portfolio. We expect that we will continue to experience higher default rates for non-prime loans, Alt-A loans and ARMs than for our prime fixed rate loans. Additionally, long-term historical performance data associated with non-prime loans, ARMs and Alt-A loans across all market conditions does not exist. We cannot be sure that the premiums including the additional risk charge that we apply to non-prime, ARMs and Alt-A loans will adequately offset the associated risk, which could adversely impact operating results. A growing portion of our insurance in force consists of loans with high loan-to-value ratios or loans that are non-prime or both, which could result in more and larger claims than loans with lower loan-to-value ratios or prime loans. A growing portion of our mortgage insurance in force consists of insurance on mortgage loans with LTVs at origination of more than 95%. When we are required to pay a claim on a higher LTV loan, it is generally more difficult to recover our costs from the underlying property, especially in areas with declining property values. Therefore, if we experience a higher default rate and paid claims on higher LTV loans, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We also insure non-prime loans. The majority of the non-prime loans we insure are known as Alt-A loans, which have credit scores commensurate with prime loans but are processed with reduced or no documentation. Our Alt-A loans also tend to have larger loan balances relative to our other loans. Because we have been insuring non-prime loans for a limited period of time, we are still developing data regarding the performance of these loans and there can be no assurance that our estimated default rates and losses will match our actual results. If our estimates prove to be inaccurate, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Further, we cannot be sure that the increased premiums that we charge for mortgage insurance on non-prime loans will be adequate to compensate us for the losses we incur on these products. 21 Table of Contents A downgrade or potential downgrade of the financial strength ratings assigned to our primary insurance subsidiary could weaken our competitive position. One or more of S&P, Moodys or Fitch could downgrade the financial strength ratings assigned to our primary insurance subsidiary, Triad, if they believe that we have experienced adverse developments in our business, financial condition or operating results. These ratings are important to our ability to market our products and to maintain our competitive position and customer confidence in our products. A downgrade in these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If the financial strength rating assigned to our insurance subsidiary were to fall below Aa3 from Moodys or the AA− level from S&P and Fitch, then mortgage lenders would not purchase mortgage insurance from us and a large segment of the mortgage securitization market, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, generally would not purchase mortgages or mortgage-backed securities insured by us. Changes in the business practices or legislation relating to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could significantly impact our business. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the beneficiaries of the majority of our policies, so their business practices have a significant influence on us. Changes in their practices could reduce the number of policies they purchase that are insured by us and consequently reduce our revenues. Some of Fannie Mae and Freddie Macs newer programs require less insurance coverage than they historically have required, and they have the ability to further reduce or eliminate coverage requirements, which would reduce demand for mortgage insurance and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers and to alter or liberalize underwriting standards on low-down-payment mortgages they purchase which thereby affect the quality of the risk and the availability of mortgage loans. Additionally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can alter the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage can be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law, and the circumstances in which mortgage servicers must perform activities intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages that are delinquent. We cannot predict the extent to which any new requirements may be enacted or how they may affect the operations of our mortgage insurance business, our capital requirements and our products. Legislation and regulatory changes, including changes impacting the GSEs, could significantly affect our business and could reduce demand for private mortgage insurance. Mortgage origination transactions are subject to compliance with various federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, or RESPA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and others. Among other things, these laws prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, require fairness and non-discrimination in granting or facilitating the granting of credit, require cancellation of insurance and refunding of unearned premiums under certain circumstances, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, and define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities. Changes in these laws or regulations could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Congress is currently considering proposed legislation relating to the regulatory oversight of the GSEs, their affordable housing initiatives, the GSEs products and marketing activities, the GSEs minimum capital standards, and their risk-based capital requirements. If adopted in its present form, OFHEO would be replaced by a new federal agency, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Agency, and its director would be given significant authority over the GSEs including, among other things, oversight of the operations of the GSEs, capital adequacy and internal controls and new program approval. The proposed legislation encompasses substantially all of the operations of the GSEs and is intended to be a comprehensive overhaul of the existing regulatory structure. The proposed legislation could limit the growth of the GSEs, which could result in a reduction in the size of the mortgage insurance market. We do not know what form, if any, such legislation will take, if any, or, if it is enacted, its impact, if any, on our financial condition and results of operations. 22 Table of Contents In addition, increases in the maximum loan amount or other features of the FHA mortgage insurance program can reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance. Future legislative and regulatory actions could decrease the demand for private mortgage insurance, which could harm our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Our revenues and profits could decline if we lose market share as a result of industry competition or if our competitive position suffers as a result of our inability to introduce and successfully market new products and programs. There are seven main mortgage insurance providers, of which we are the smallest. The mortgage insurance industry is highly dynamic and intensely competitive. The other private mortgage insurance providers are Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, Radian Guaranty Inc., PMI Mortgage Insurance Company, Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company, United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company, and Republic Mortgage Insurance Company. Two of these are subsidiaries of well-capitalized companies with stronger insurance financial strength ratings and greater access to capital than we have. If we are unable to compete successfully against other private mortgage insurers, or if we experience delays in introducing competitive new products and programs or if these products or programs are less profitable than our existing products and programs, our business will suffer If mortgage lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance that we write could decline, which could reduce our revenues and profits. There are an increasing number of alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance, and new alternatives may develop, which could reduce the demand for our mortgage insurance. Existing alternatives include:  mortgage lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance utilizing 80-10-10 structures; over the past several years, the volume of these loans, or variations of them, have increased as alternatives to loans requiring mortgage insurance;  investors using credit enhancements as a partial or complete substitute for private mortgage insurance;  lenders and investors holding mortgages in their portfolios and self-insuring;  member institutions providing credit enhancement on loans sold to a Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, which do not have the same requirements for mortgage insurance as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Changes in regulatory requirements could impact captive mortgage insurance arrangements for all industry participants. State insurance departments or other officials may conduct investigations or reviews of our business practices such as our captive reinsurance or other risk sharing arrangements. The anti-referral fee provisions of RESPA provide that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as well as the insurance commissioner or attorney general of any state may bring an action to enjoin violations of these provisions of RESPA. The insurance law provisions of many states prohibit paying for the referral of insurance business and provide various mechanisms to enforce this prohibition. In the summer of 2005, we received an inquiry from the New York Insurance Department relating to captive mortgage insurance arrangements to which we have responded fully. In January of 2006, we received a request for information from the Minnesota Insurance Department regarding our lender captive reinsurance arrangements to which we have also responded fully. While we believe our captive reinsurance arrangements are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such reviews or investigations nor is it possible to predict their effect on Triad or the entire mortgage insurance industry. 23 Table of Contents Since we generally cannot cancel mortgage insurance policies or adjust renewal premiums, unanticipated claims could cause our financial performance to suffer. We generally cannot cancel the mortgage insurance coverage that we provide or adjust renewal premiums during the life of a mortgage insurance policy. As a result, the impact of unanticipated claims generally cannot be offset by premium increases on policies in force or limited by non-renewal or cancellation of insurance coverage. The premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for the risks and costs associated with the insurance coverage provided to our customers. An increase in the number or size of unanticipated claims could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Our loss experience is likely to increase as our policies continue to age. We expect the majority of claims on insured loans in our current portfolio to occur during the second through the fifth years after loan origination. Primary insurance written from the period of January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2005 represented 63% of our Primary risk in force as of December 31, 2006. Accordingly, a significant majority of our Primary portfolio is in, or approaching, its peak claim years. We believe our loss experience is likely to increase as our policies age. If the claim frequency on our risk in force significantly exceeds the claim frequency that was assumed in setting our premium rates, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our revenues and DAC amortization depend on the renewal of policies that may terminate or fail to renew. The large majority of our premiums each month have been derived from the monthly renewal of policies that we previously have written. Factors that could cause an increase in non-renewals of our policies include falling mortgage interest rates (which tend to lead to increased refinancings and associated cancellations of mortgage insurance), appreciating home values which can lead to more refinances and mortgage insurance cancellations, and changes in the mortgage insurance cancellation requirements applicable to mortgage lenders and homeowners. Additionally, the amount of DAC amortization expense would be adversely impacted if policies terminate at a rate faster than was originally estimated in our DAC models. A decrease in the length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force reduces our revenues and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims. A significant percentage of our new insurance written is underwritten pursuant to a delegated underwriting program. These programs permit certain mortgage lenders to determine whether mortgage loans meet our program guidelines and enable these lenders to commit us to issue mortgage insurance. We may expand the availability of delegated underwriting to additional customers. If an approved lender commits us to insure a mortgage loan, we may refuse to insure, or we may rescind coverage on that loan if the lender fails to follow our delegated underwriting guidelines. Even if we terminate a lenders underwriting authority, we remain at risk for any loans previously insured on our behalf by the lender before that termination. The performance of loans insured through programs of delegated underwriting has not been tested over a period of extended adverse economic conditions, meaning that the program could lead to greater losses than we anticipate. If losses are significantly greater than anticipated, our delegated underwriting program could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Geographic concentration of our risk in force could increase claims and losses and harm our financial performance. We could be affected by economic downturns, natural disasters and other events in specific regions of the United States where a large portion of our business is concentrated. As of December 31, 2006, 14% of our risk in force was located in California, 11% was located in Florida and 7% was located in Texas. California and Florida have seen some of the highest house price appreciation over the last several years and in certain areas, have recently experienced house price depreciation. If housing declines continue or deepen, this could have an additional impact 24 Table of Contents on the ultimate amount of paid claims in certain geographic areas and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. If we fail to properly underwrite mortgage loans when we provide contract underwriting services, we may be required to provide monetary and other remedies to the customer. Under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements existing with certain lenders, we agree to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event that we make material errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria, subject to contractual limitations on liability. As a part of the contract underwriting services, we provide monetary and other remedies to our customers in the event that we fail to properly underwrite a mortgage loan. As a result, we assume credit and interest rate risk in connection with our contract underwriting services. Worsening economic conditions, a deterioration in the quality of our underwriting services or other factors could cause our contract underwriting liabilities to increase and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we have established a reserve to provide for potential claims in connection with our contract underwriting services, we have limited historical experience that we can use to establish reserves for these potential liabilities, and these reserves may not be adequate to cover liabilities that may arise. We have committed to an operational presence in Canada during 2007. Our ability to successfully organize, develop successful administrative systems and gain meaningful market share in Canada is dependent on many factors over which we have no control. As of the date of this report, we have not received a license to operate in Canada. There are several regulatory approvals that we are awaiting including an approval by the Department of Finance that allows lenders in Canada to obtain capital relief for lenders requiring borrowers to purchase mortgage insurance on mortgage loans. Obtaining all regulatory approvals is a process that cannot be accelerated and our ultimate entrance date into Canada is unknown at this time. Additionally, we are in the process of building policy administrative systems and lender interfaces that are different than those used in the U.S. These systems will allow the interchange of data to facilitate the underwriting process. In Canada, we will compete with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a Crown corporation that is not subject to the same capital requirements or profit objectives as we will be. Additionally, we will compete with Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company Canada which is a well-established private mortgage insurer that has been in Canada for many years as well as several other mortgage insurers that have announced plans to enter that market. Our ability to differentiate ourselves from the other mortgage insurance companies as well as CMHC and gain a meaningful market share in Canada is dependent on our ability to execute our entrance strategy effectively. Success in Canada is expected to have a meaningful impact on our bottom line in the long term; however, we do not expect the Canadian operations to have a significant financial impact in 2007. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments We received a letter from the Division of Corporate Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission dated December 22, 2006, requesting additional information relating to our Form 10-K for 2005. Specifically, the Commission staff requested information to better understand our disclosure relating to the following points:  The calculation of loss reserves related to defaults incurred but not reported,  Additional sensitivity analysis around the frequency and severity factors utilized in our loss reserve projections as described in the Critical Accounting Policies,  Additional disclosures related to the subsequent loss reserve deficiency reported in 2005 and 2004 based upon the reported reserves at December 31, 2004 and 2003. On January 31, 2007, we responded to the Commissions comments in a detailed letter addressing each of the above items. On March 9, 2007, we had further conversations with the Commission and the staff requested additional clarification of certain issues and an additional schedule. 25 Table of Contents
