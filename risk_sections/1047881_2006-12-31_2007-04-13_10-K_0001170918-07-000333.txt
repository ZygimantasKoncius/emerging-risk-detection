ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Several of the matters discussed in this document contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors associated with the forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ from those projected or forecast are included in the statements below. In addition to other information contained in this report, readers should carefully consider the following cautionary statements and risk factors. OUR GROWTH AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY, ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN RESOLVING A DISPUTE THAT NOW EXISTS REGARDING OUR RIGHTS UNDER OUR EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT WITH PRO-FIT. Pursuant to our agreement with Pro-Fit Holdings, Limited, we have exclusive rights in certain geographic areas to Pro-Fit's stretch and rigid waistband technology. We are in litigation with Pro-Fit regarding our rights. See Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" for discussion of this litigation. We derive a significant amount of revenues from the sale of products incorporating the stretch waistband technology. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to reach a settlement in a manner acceptable to us and ensuing litigation is not resolved in a manner favorable to us. Additionally, we have incurred significant legal fees in this litigation, and unless the case is settled, we will continue to incur additional legal fees in increasing amounts as the case accelerates to trial. IF WE LOSE OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS OR THEY FAIL TO PURCHASE AT ANTICIPATED LEVELS, OUR SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon the commercial success of our larger customers. If these customers fail to purchase our products at anticipated levels, or our relationship with these customers terminates, it may have an adverse affect on our results because: o We will lose a primary source of revenue if these customers choose not to purchase our products or services; o We may not be able to reduce fixed costs incurred in developing the relationship with these customers in a timely manner; o We may not be able to recoup setup and inventory costs; o We may be left holding inventory that cannot be sold to other customers; and o We may not be able to collect our receivables from them. In October 2006, our exclusive supply agreement with Levi Strauss & Co., pursuant to which we supplied Levi with TEKFIT waistbands for their Dockers programs, expired. With the expiration of this contract we now have broader access to other customers and we intend to actively expand this product offering to other brands. While some orders have already been placed by a new brand and deliveries are scheduled early in 2007, sales of this product to Levi are expected to end during the first quarter of 2007 and to be significantly lower than in the previous year, and orders from new brands are not expected to fully offset these declines for at least the next two quarters, if at all. The revenues we derived from the sale of products incorporating the stretch waistband technology represented approximately 19% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. A failure to attract new customers for our TEKFIT waistbands could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH LISTING REQUIREMENTS, OUR SHARES MAY BE REMOVED FROM LISTING ON AMEX. In May 2006 we were advised by AMEX that we were non-compliant with the minimum net equity listing requirements and we were afforded an opportunity to submit a plan to AMEX that provided for increases in our equity beyond the minimum $4.0 million equity requirement within an eighteen-month timeframe from the date of the notice from AMEX. On August 3, 2006 AMEX accepted our plan to regain compliance and has given us an extension until November 16, 2007 to become compliant with the AMEX continued listing standards. During this period, we will be subject to periodic review by the AMEX staff and failure to make progress consistent with the plan or to regain compliance with continued listing standards by the end of the extension period could result in being delisted from the American Stock Exchange. In addition we have 9 suffered substantial recurring losses and may fail to comply with other listing requirements of AMEX. We may not be able to regain compliance with these matters within the time allowed by the exchange, and our shares of common stock may be removed from the listing on AMEX. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESTRUCTURE THE $12.5 MILLION SECURED CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES PAYABLE TO EXTEND THE MATURITY OF THIS DEBT, OR TO SECURE ALTERNATE FINANCING TO REPLACE THESE NOTES, WE MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR PAYMENT. The $12.5 million in convertible notes payable mature in November 2007 and it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in time to pay these notes. The debt holders have a conversion option at $3.65 per share and we can require conversion only if the market price of our stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price for a minimum of fifteen trading days just prior to their maturity and certain trading volume requirements are met. In the event that the shares are not converted, in order to obtain an extension of the note term we may have to lower the conversion price of the debt resulting in additional dilution of the current shareholder value, or we may default on their payment and the note holders, in addition to pursuing other remedies, may take action to secure the collateral for these notes, the TALON brand name, resulting in substantial disruption to our business operations and adversely affecting the financial operating results and financial position of the company going forward. IF CUSTOMERS DEFAULT ON INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH US, WE WILL BE LEFT HOLDING NON-SALABLE INVENTORY. We hold significant inventories for specific customer programs, which the customers have committed to purchase. If any customer defaults on these commitments, or insists on markdowns, we may incur a charge in connection with our holding significant amounts of non-salable inventory and this would have a negative impact on our operations and cash flow. OUR REVENUES MAY BE HARMED IF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN. Our revenues depend on the health of the economy and the growth of our customers and potential future customers. When economic conditions weaken, certain apparel manufacturers and retailers, including some of our customers may experience financial difficulties that increase the risk of extending credit to such customers. Customers adversely affected by economic conditions have also attempted to improve their own operating efficiencies by concentrating their purchasing power among a narrowing group of vendors. There can be no assurance that we will remain a preferred vendor to our existing customers. A decrease in business from or loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, if the economic conditions in the United States worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs, we may experience a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. BECAUSE WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ALWAYS OBTAIN MATERIALS WHEN WE NEED THEM AND WE MAY LOSE SALES AND CUSTOMERS. Lead times for materials we order can vary significantly and depend on many factors, including the specific supplier, the contract terms and the demand for particular materials at a given time. From time to time, we may experience fluctuations in the prices, and disruptions in the supply, of materials. Shortages or disruptions in the supply of materials, or our inability to procure materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could lead us to miss deadlines for orders and lose sales and customers. WE OPERATE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS THAT MAY RESULT IN UNEXPECTED REDUCTIONS IN REVENUE AND STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY. We operate in an industry that is subject to significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter, which may lead to unexpected reductions in revenues and stock price volatility. Factors that may influence our quarterly operating results include: o The volume and timing of customer orders received during the quarter; o The timing and magnitude of customers' marketing campaigns; o The loss or addition of a major customer; o The availability and pricing of materials for our products; o The increased expenses incurred in connection with the introduction of new products; 10 o Currency fluctuations; o Delays caused by third parties; and o Changes in our product mix or in the relative contribution to sales of our subsidiaries. Due to these factors, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results may be below our stockholders' expectations and those of public market analysts. If this occurs, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company. In October 2005, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against us. See Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" for a detailed description of this lawsuit. THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IS UNPREDICTABLE AND AN ADVERSE DECISION IN ANY SUCH MATTER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We are defendants in a number of litigation matters. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in each and all of the litigation matters to which we have been named a party, and intend to contest each lawsuit vigorously, no assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. We maintain product liability and director and officer insurance that we regard as reasonably adequate to protect us from potential claims; however we cannot assure you that it will be adequate to cover any losses. Further, the costs of insurance have increased dramatically in recent years, and the availability of coverage has decreased. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current levels of insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all. OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE CYCLICAL BUYING PATTERNS WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO HAVE PERIODS OF LOW SALES VOLUME. Most of our customers are in the apparel industry. The apparel industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variations. Our business has experienced, and we expect our business to continue to experience, significant cyclical fluctuations due, in part, to customer buying patterns, which may result in periods of low sales usually in the first and fourth quarters of our financial year. OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS DEPENDENT ON INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS ON A GLOBAL BASIS AND, TO THE EXTENT THAT WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AND SUPPORT OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, IT CAN RESULT IN LOST REVENUES. We must consolidate and centralize the management of our subsidiaries and significantly expand and improve our financial and operating controls. Additionally, we must effectively integrate the information systems of our worldwide operations with the information systems of our principal offices in California. Our failure to do so could result in lost revenues, delay financial reporting or adverse effects on the information reported. THE LOSS OF KEY MANAGEMENT AND SALES PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND SECURE ACCOUNTS AND GENERATE SALES. Our success has and will continue to depend to a significant extent upon key management and sales personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to establish and maintain client relationships. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain personnel with a variety of sales, operating and managerial skills. IF WE EXPERIENCE DISRUPTIONS AT ANY OF OUR FOREIGN FACILITIES, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND MAY LOSE SALES AND CUSTOMERS. Currently, we do not operate duplicate facilities in different geographic areas. Therefore, in the event of a regional disruption where we maintain one or more of our facilities, it is unlikely that we could shift our operations to a different geographic region and we may have to cease or curtail our operations. This may cause us to lose sales and customers. The types of disruptions that may occur include: 11 o Foreign trade disruptions; o Import restrictions; o Labor disruptions; o Embargoes; o Government intervention; o Natural disasters; or o Regional pandemics. INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS THAT WE RELY UPON FOR OUR ORDER TRACKING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE DISRUPTIONS AND AS A RESULT WE MAY LOSE REVENUES AND CUSTOMERS. To the extent that we fail to adequately update and maintain the hardware and software implementing our integrated systems, our customers may be delayed or interrupted due to defects in our hardware or our source code. In addition, since our software is Internet-based, interruptions in Internet service generally can negatively impact our ability to use our systems to monitor and manage various aspects of our customer's trim needs. Such defects or interruptions could result in lost revenues and lost customers. THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES THAT OFFER SOME OR ALL OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE SELL AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE OUR BUSINESS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We compete in highly competitive and fragmented industries with numerous local and regional companies that provide some or all of the products and services we offer. We compete with national and international design companies, distributors and manufacturers of tags, packaging products, zippers and other trim items. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories and greater financial and other resources than we do. UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY MAY INCREASE OUR LITIGATION COSTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES. We rely on trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our designs and other proprietary property worldwide. We cannot be certain that these laws will be sufficient to protect our property. In particular, the laws of some countries in which our products are distributed or may be distributed in the future may not protect our products and intellectual rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If litigation is necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Ultimately, we may be unable, for financial or other reasons, to enforce our rights under intellectual property laws, which could result in lost sales. IF OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE ANY OTHER PERSON'S PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, WE MAY BE SUED AND HAVE TO PAY LEGAL EXPENSES AND JUDGMENTS AND REDESIGN OR DISCONTINUE SELLING OUR PRODUCTS. From time to time in our industry, third parties allege infringement of their proprietary rights. Any infringement claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements as a means of settlement. If we are found to have infringed the proprietary rights of others, we could be required to pay damages, cease sales of the infringing products and redesign the products or discontinue their sale. Any of these outcomes, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS ARE NOT UNCOMMON IN THE APPAREL INDUSTRY AND OUR CUSTOMERS MAY MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST US FOR PRODUCTS WE HAVE NOT PRODUCED AND WE MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THESE FALSE CLAIMS. Counterfeiting of valuable trade names is commonplace in the apparel industry and while there are industry organizations and federal laws designed to protect the brand owner, these counterfeit products are not always detected and it can be difficult to prove the manufacturing source of these products. Accordingly, we may be adversely affected if counterfeit products damage our relationships with customers, and we incur costs to prove these products are counterfeit, to defend ourselves against false claims, or we may have to pay for false claims. 12 OUR STOCK PRICE MAY DECREASE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND CAUSE OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. The following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease, perhaps substantially: o The failure of our quarterly operating results to meet expectations of investors or securities analysts; o Adverse developments in the financial markets, the apparel industry and the worldwide or regional economies; o Interest rates; o Changes in accounting principles; o Intellectual property and legal matters; o Sales of common stock by existing shareholders or holders of options; o Announcements of key developments by our competitors; and o The reaction of markets and securities analysts to announcements and developments involving our company. IF WE NEED TO SELL OR ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR ASSUME ADDITIONAL DEBT TO FINANCE FUTURE GROWTH, OUR STOCKHOLDERS' OWNERSHIP COULD BE DILUTED OR OUR EARNINGS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. Our business strategy may include expansion through internal growth, by acquiring complementary businesses or by establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and suppliers. In order to do so or to fund our other activities, we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute our stockholders' value. We may also assume additional debt and incur impairment losses to our intangible assets if we acquire another company. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF ACQUISITIONS. We may consider strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise, subject to the obtaining of any necessary financing. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including diversion of our management's attention away from our operating activities. We cannot assure you that we will not encounter unanticipated problems or liabilities relating to the integration of an acquired company's operations, nor can we assure you that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions. OUR ACTUAL TAX LIABILITIES MAY DIFFER FROM ESTIMATED TAX RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR FUTURE RESULTS. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. Our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results. WE HAVE ADOPTED A NUMBER OF ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES THAT MAY DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Our stockholders' rights plan, our ability to issue additional shares of preferred stock and some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to make an unsolicited takeover attempt of us. These anti-takeover measures may depress the price of our common stock by making it more difficult for third parties to acquire us by offering to purchase shares of our stock at a premium to its market price. INSIDERS OWN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR STOCKHOLDERS' ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF KEY TRANSACTIONS. As of April 10, 2007, our officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The Dyne family, which includes Mark Dyne, Colin Dyne, and Jonathan Burstein, who are also our directors; Larry Dyne and the estate of Harold Dyne; beneficially owned approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at March 31, 2007. As a result, our officers and directors and the Dyne family are able to exert considerable influence over the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, including the election of our Board of Directors. The voting power of these stockholders could also 13 discourage others from seeking to acquire control of us through the purchase of our common stock, which might depress the price of our common stock. WE MAY FACE INTERRUPTION OF PRODUCTION AND SERVICES DUE TO INCREASED SECURITY MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO TERRORISM. Our business depends on the free flow of products and services through the channels of commerce. In response to terrorists' activities and threats aimed at the United States, transportation, mail, financial and other services may be slowed or stopped altogether. Extensive delays or stoppages in transportation, mail, financial or other services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may experience an increase in operating costs, such as costs for transportation, insurance and security as a result of the activities and potential delays. We may also experience delays in receiving payments from payers that have been affected by the terrorist activities. The United States economy in general may be adversely affected by the terrorist activities and any economic downturn could adversely impact our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to grow our business.
