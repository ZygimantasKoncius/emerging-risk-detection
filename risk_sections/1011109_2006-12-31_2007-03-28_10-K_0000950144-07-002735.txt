DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. General Roberts Realty Investors, Inc. is a Georgia corporation formed in 1994 that owns and operates multifamily residential, retail, and office properties as a self-administered, self-managed equity real estate investment trust, or REIT. We expect to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. A REIT is a legal entity that holds real estate interests and, through its payment of distributions, is able to reduce or avoid incurring federal income tax at the corporate level. This structure allows shareholders to participate in real estate investments without the double taxation of income  i.e., at both the corporate and shareholder levels  that generally results from an investment in shares of a corporation. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must, among other things, distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90% of our taxable income. We enter into contractual commitments in the normal course of business with Roberts Properties, Inc. (Roberts Properties) and Roberts Properties Construction, Inc. (Roberts Construction), together referred to as the Roberts Companies. Mr. Charles S. Roberts, the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Roberts Realty, owns all of the outstanding stock of the Roberts Companies. The contracts between Roberts Realty and the Roberts Companies relate to the development and construction of real estate assets and, from time to time, the acquisition of real estate. We develop, construct, own, and manage multifamily apartment communities, neighborhood retail centers, and one office building, all of which are currently located in Georgia. As a result, we have four reportable operating segments: (1) the multifamily segment consisting of operating apartment communities; (2) the retail/office segment consisting of operating retail centers and an office building; (3) the land segment consisting of various tracts of land that are either under development and construction or held for investment; and (4) the corporate segment consisting primarily of operating cash and cash equivalents plus miscellaneous other assets. For more detailed information about these segments, please see Note 8, Segment Reporting, in the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report. Our common stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol RPI. Our executive offices are located at 450 Northridge Parkway, Suite 302, Atlanta, Georgia 30350, and our telephone number is (770) 394-6000. We do not maintain a corporate website. As of March 14, 2007, we have 10 full-time employees. The Operating Partnership We conduct our business through Roberts Properties Residential, L.P., which we refer to as the operating partnership. The operating partnership owns all of our properties directly or indirectly through wholly owned subsidiaries. As of March 14, 2007, Roberts Realty owns a 76.4% interest in the operating partnership and is its sole general partner. We expect to continue to conduct our business in this organizational structure, which is sometimes called an umbrella partnership or UPREIT. Our ownership interest in the operating partnership entitles us to share in cash distributions from, and in the 3 Table of Contents profits and losses of, the operating partnership generally in proportion to our ownership percentage. In this report, we refer to units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership as units and the holders of units as unitholders. The holders of units include Mr. Charles S. Roberts, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and President, and the former limited partners in the limited partnerships that were merged into the operating partnership. Unitholders generally have the right to require the operating partnership to redeem their units. A unitholder who submits units for redemption will receive, at our election, either an equal number of shares or cash for those units at their fair market value, based upon the then current trading price of the shares. We have adopted a policy of issuing shares in exchange for units. We have the right, however, at our election, to issue shares in exchange for all outstanding units. Our articles of incorporation limit ownership by any one holder to 3.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, with two exceptions. First, Mr. Roberts can beneficially own up to 35% of the outstanding shares. Second, any shareholder who beneficially owned more than 3.7% of our outstanding common shares on July 22, 2004, the date that we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation revising the ownership limits, can retain indefinitely the shares the shareholder owned as of that date but cannot increase that ownership in the future. That shareholder can also exchange any units in the operating partnership he owned on that date for shares of common stock. Otherwise, unitholders cannot redeem their units if doing so would cause the number of shares they own to exceed those ownership limits. Shares issued for units are registered with the SEC and are freely transferable, other than by affiliates. Whenever we issue shares, we are obligated to contribute the net proceeds from that issuance to the operating partnership, and the operating partnership is obligated to issue the same number of units to us. The operating partnership agreement permits the operating partnership, without the consent of the unitholders, to sell additional units and add limited partners. Recent Developments Purchase of 1.3-Acre Parcel at Grand Pavilion Retail Center On October 3, 2006, we purchased a 1.34-acre parcel of land located adjacent to our Grand Pavilion retail center. The purchase price was approximately $876,000, including closing costs, and we financed the acquisition by drawing on our line of credit. Purchase of Remaining 18% Undivided Interest at Peachtree Parkway On December 6, 2006, we acquired the remaining 18% undivided interest in our Peachtree Parkway property from an unaffiliated third party for $2,306,000, including closing costs. In addition, we assumed and paid the $146,000 balance that the seller owed to Roberts Properties for the sellers portion of the total $811,111 amount incurred through the date of closing under the design and development agreement for the property. As part of the transaction, we assumed the sellers remaining obligations under the design and development agreement with Roberts Properties and the construction contract with Roberts Construction. We financed the purchase with a portion of the proceeds of an $8,175,000 land loan on our Peachtree Parkway land that closed simultaneously with our acquisition of the 18% undivided interest. See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions  Transactions with Roberts Companies. 4 Table of Contents Trends We have two stabilized residential properties totaling 403 residential units and three stabilized retail centers totaling 112,322 square feet. In addition, we have two properties in lease-up, six properties in the planning and design phase, and one parcel of undeveloped land held for investment, representing a total investment of $138 million (with a corresponding $76 million of debt secured by these properties), which are currently producing negative cash flow after debt service coverage. With respect to the six properties that are now under development, we estimate the total cost of the projects, including contractor fees payable to Roberts Construction, to be approximately $206 million, although the exact amount could be materially different. We made good progress on our design and development work during 2006, and we expect to begin construction on the first of our five new multifamily apartment communities by mid-2007. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise the debt and equity needed to complete all of these development projects, although we can control the pace of development and construction. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources in this report. Since our inception in 1994, we have focused primarily on the development, construction, and ownership of multifamily residential communities, including land held for subsequent development. In recent years, particularly in 2005, we diversified our real estate activities with the acquisition of three neighborhood retail centers. We are currently experiencing negative operating cash flow as a result of selling the seven residential communities totaling 1,610 units in 2004 and 2005 while making a distribution to shareholders (and unitholders) of $4.50 per share (and unit) totaling $32.5 million and reinvesting a portion of the remaining proceeds in undeveloped land that will not generate cash flow until we either develop or sell it. We believe the combination of improving occupancy at our Addison Place apartments and townhomes, the financial performance of the three retail centers we acquired in late 2005, and the continued lease-up of our Addison Place Shops retail center and Northridge office building will substantially reduce our current negative cash flow as we pursue our development and construction plan. In addition, we have the following: (a) approximately $4,000,000 in cash and cash equivalents; (b) $2,500,000 available on our line of credit; and (c) 20.7 acres of unencumbered land that we acquired for $21,093,000 (including closing costs), which we can use as collateral for land loans. During the past few years, historically low interest rates have made home ownership an attractive alternative to renting, which in turn has adversely affected our occupancy and rental rates. In Atlanta, our current market, low mortgage interest rates have contributed to lower demand from apartment residents. To maintain our occupancy, we offered incentives in the form of rent concessions to prospective residents, which decreased both our revenues and income from operations. We continue to offer rental concessions as a means to attract and retain residents. Although we are seeing some indications that rental concessions are beginning to decrease, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty how rapidly or to what level rental concessions may decrease. We have not paid regular quarterly dividends since the third quarter of 2001 and we do not have any plans to resume paying regular quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future. We will make distributions, however, to the extent required to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Growth Strategies Our business plan and growth strategy are focused on generating cash flow and capital appreciation by building and managing new residential communities, neighborhood retail centers, and mixed-use projects of the highest quality and value in excellent high-growth neighborhoods. Our business objective is to increase the long-term total return to our shareholders and unitholders through 5 Table of Contents appreciation in the value of our real estate assets and to return this appreciation to our shareholders and unitholders through the payment of distributions when we sell properties. We may, however, decide to use at least some of the cash proceeds generated from the sale of properties for our development and construction program or for other corporate purposes. Alternatively, if we choose to sell properties using a Section 1031 tax-deferred exchange, we will retain the value created through appreciation and reinvest the cash proceeds in a similar income producing property or undeveloped land. To achieve our objectives:  we focus on maximizing cash flow from our stabilized apartment communities by seeking to maintain high occupancy levels, obtain regular rent increases, manage resident turnover efficiently, and control operating expenses; and  we look for the right opportunities to develop and/or acquire new multifamily residential communities, neighborhood retail centers, and/or mixed-use projects in Atlanta and Palm Beach County, Florida. We will engage others, including the Roberts Companies, to help us pursue these strategies, which are described in more detail below. Property Management Strategy. We believe that efficiently managing our existing operating real estate assets is a fundamental element of our investment strategy. As of March 14, 2007, we employed seven property management personnel, including property managers, leasing consultants, on-site maintenance personnel, and corporate support staff. We believe our property management expertise will enable us to continue to deliver quality services, thereby promoting resident satisfaction, maintaining high resident retention, and enhancing the value of each of our operating real estate assets. Our property management strategy will continue to be:  to increase occupancy and rental rates as market conditions permit;  to minimize resident turnover and delinquent rental payments through strict review of each applicants creditworthiness;  to provide our commercial (retail and office) tenants with superior facilities that enable them to succeed in business;  to control operating expenses and increase net operating income at each of our properties; and  to provide superior customer service to our apartment residents and commercial tenants. Development and Construction Strategy. We intend to continue developing high quality multifamily residential communities, neighborhood retail centers, and mixed-use projects for long-term ownership. Toward this goal, we will continue to engage Roberts Properties and Roberts Construction to perform development and construction services for the operating partnership. During the past 20 years, the Roberts Companies have developed, constructed and/or managed a substantial number of multifamily residential units. We currently own and manage four properties that Roberts Properties developed, including our Northridge office building, our Addison Place residential community, consisting of the Addison Place apartments and the Addison Place townhomes, and the Addison Place Shops retail center. We expect that affiliates of Mr. Roberts will continue to develop and construct properties for us, and we have entered into agreements for those services as described in Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. We may also hire other development or construction companies, as we have done in the past, in Atlanta and elsewhere if we deem it to be in our best interests to do so. We have engaged the Roberts Companies to develop and construct five of the six properties under development described above. 6 Table of Contents We believe that the number and quality of the multifamily residential units developed by the Roberts Companies, the relationships Mr. Roberts and employees of the Roberts Companies have developed with local permitting and governmental authorities, and the Roberts Companies experience with the development, construction and financing process will minimize the barriers to new development. These barriers include governmental growth control, a difficult rezoning and permitting process, and the limited availability of well-located sites. We believe that these restraints on construction offer a continuing opportunity for us to achieve favorable long-term returns on the development of well-located, high quality multifamily residential communities, neighborhood retail centers, and mixed-use projects. In analyzing the potential development of a particular project, we evaluate the geographic, demographic, economic and financial data, including:  households, population and employment growth;  prevailing rental and occupancy rates in the immediate market area and the perceived potential for growth in those rates;  costs that affect profitability of the investment, including construction, financing, operating, and maintenance costs;  income levels in the area;  existing employment bases;  traffic volume, transportation access, proximity to commercial centers and regional malls; and  proximity to and quality of the areas schools. We will also consider physical elements regarding a particular site, including the probability of zoning approval (if required), availability of utilities and infrastructure, and other physical characteristics of the site. Determination of Investment, Financing and Conflict of Interest Policies Our board of directors sets our investment policies, financing policies, and conflict of interest policies; these policies are summarized below. Our board may amend or revise them from time to time without a vote of our shareholders or any vote of the partners of the operating partnership, except that:  we cannot change our policy of holding our assets and conducting our business exclusively through the operating partnership without amending the operating partnership agreement, which will generally require the consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the limited partners in the operating partnership including, if applicable, Roberts Realty; and  any changes in our conflicts of interest policies must be approved by a majority of the independent directors and otherwise be consistent with legal requirements. Investment Policies Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate. We conduct all of our investment activities through the operating partnership and will continue to do so as long as the operating partnership exists. (The agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership provides that it is not required to be dissolved until 2093.) Our investment objectives are to achieve stable cash flow and, over time, to increase cash flow and portfolio value by continuing to develop multifamily residential communities, neighborhood retail centers, and mixed-use projects for ownership as well as acquiring additional real estate assets that we anticipate will produce additional cash flow. 7 Table of Contents Our policy is to develop real estate projects where we believe favorable investment opportunities exist based on market conditions at the time of the investment. We expect to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the direct ownership of properties by the operating partnership, although, as discussed below, we may also pursue indirect property ownership opportunities. We intend to develop multifamily residential communities, neighborhood retail centers, and mixed-use projects primarily in Atlanta and South Florida. Our governing documents do not limit our future development or investment activities to any geographic area, product type, or specified percentage of our assets. Possible Acquisition of Properties from Mr. Roberts or His Affiliates. Mr. Roberts and Roberts Properties have been engaged in the development of residential and commercial real estate since 1970, and Mr. Roberts expects that he and Roberts Properties will continue to engage in multifamily residential and commercial real estate development. Provided that any transaction or agreement complies with the policies discussed under Conflict of Interest Policies below, we may engage in transactions of various types with Mr. Roberts, the Roberts Companies and/or other affiliates of Mr. Roberts to develop or acquire real estate. Those transactions may include the following:  we may hire Mr. Roberts or the Roberts Companies to develop and construct real estate assets under a fee arrangement;  we may acquire undeveloped property from Mr. Roberts or his affiliates for future development, which we did in 2004 and 2005; or  we may acquire from Mr. Roberts or his affiliates partially or completely constructed properties, whether in their lease-up phase or already leased and stabilized. No particular arrangements have been determined, other than the communities now under development and construction as described elsewhere in this report. An affiliate of Mr. Roberts owns land adjacent to our Sawmill Village development project. Mr. Roberts intends to develop this land in conjunction with the development of the overall project. We may enter into a management agreement with Mr. Roberts for management of the assets to be constructed and owned by Mr. Roberts, assuming we are in compliance with all REIT rules and requirements. Securities of or Interest in Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers. We or the operating partnership may invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or invest in securities of other issuers, including investments by us and the operating partnership for the purpose of exercising control over those entities. We or the operating partnership may acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar entities where those investments would be consistent with our investment policies. We currently have no plans to invest in the securities of other issuers. In making any of the investments described in this paragraph, we would comply with the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code. We will not make any investments if the proposed investment would cause us or the operating partnership to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. No Investments in Mortgages. We do not own any mortgages, and we do not intend to invest in mortgages or to engage in originating, servicing or warehousing mortgages. 8 Table of Contents Financing Policies Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. We have an informal policy that we will not incur indebtedness in excess of 75% of what the board of directors believes is the aggregate fair market value of our assets at any given time. We may, however, from time to time re-evaluate our borrowing policies in light of then current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market value of the operating partnerships real estate assets, growth and acquisition opportunities, and other factors. Modification of this policy may adversely affect the interests of our shareholders. To the extent that the board of directors determines the need to seek additional capital, we may raise capital through additional equity offerings, debt financing, asset sales or retention of cash flow, or a combination of these methods. Our retention of cash flow is subject to provisions in the Internal Revenue Code requiring a REIT to distribute a specified percentage of taxable income, and we must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income. As long as the operating partnership is in existence, we will contribute the net proceeds of all equity capital we raise to the operating partnership in exchange for units or other interests in the operating partnership. In September 1998, our board authorized a stock repurchase plan of up to 400,000 shares of our outstanding common stock. We repurchased 362,588 shares for $2,764,000 prior to 2002, and we currently have authority to repurchase an additional 37,412 shares. In June 2005, we sold the treasury shares in a private offering to Mr. Roberts and Mr. Wm. Jarell Jones, a director, for $2,901,000. We used the proceeds of this offering to fund our development and construction program. We have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages on any single property or on the operating partnerships portfolio as a whole. Conflict of Interest Policies The board of directors is subject to provisions of Georgia law that are designed to eliminate or minimize potential conflicts of interest. We can give no assurances that these policies will always eliminate the influence of those conflicts. If these policies are not successful, the board could make decisions that might fail to reflect fully the interests of all shareholders. Under Georgia law, a director may not misappropriate corporate opportunities that he learns of solely by serving as a member of the board of directors. In addition, under Georgia law, a transaction effected by us or any entity we control (including the operating partnership) in which a director, or specified related persons and entities of the director, have a conflicting interest of such financial significance that it would reasonably be expected to exert an influence on the directors judgment may not be enjoined, set aside, or give rise to damages on the grounds of that interest if either:  the transaction is approved, after disclosure of the interest, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by disinterested shareholders; or  the transaction is established to have been fair to us. Our board of directors has adopted a policy that all conflicting interest transactions must be authorized by a majority of the disinterested directors, but only if there are at least two directors who are disinterested with respect to the matter at issue. In addition, under the applicable rules of the American Stock Exchange, related party transactions are subject to appropriate review and oversight by the audit committee of our board of directors. 9 Table of Contents Other Policies We and the operating partnership have authority to offer our securities and to repurchase and otherwise reacquire our securities, and we may engage in those activities in the future. We have adopted a policy that we will issue shares to unitholders who exercise their rights of redemption. In the future, we may make loans to joint ventures in which we participate to meet working capital needs. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting, agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers, and we do not intend to do so. We intend to continue to make investments in a manner so that we will not be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. At all times, we intend to make investments in a manner to be consistent with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code for us to continue to qualify as a REIT unless, because of changing circumstances or changes in the Internal Revenue Code or in applicable regulations, our board of directors decides that it is no longer in our best interests to qualify as a REIT. Competition Our existing multifamily community and the land on which we are developing new multifamily communities are located in developed areas that include other apartment communities. The number of competitive multifamily communities in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present communities or any newly developed or acquired community, as well as on our rental rates. We face competition from other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, partnerships and investment companies and other apartment REITs, to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development. As an owner of apartment communities, we face competition for prospective residents from other apartment owners whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the prospective resident seeks. We also compete with the condominium and single-family home markets, whose competitiveness has been significantly enhanced in recent years by the historically low mortgage interest rates. Our neighborhood retail centers and office building face competition from similar retail centers and office buildings within their geographic areas to lease new space, renew leases, or re-lease spaces as leases expire. Some of these competing properties may be newer, better located, better capitalized, or have better tenants than our properties. In addition, any new competitive properties that are developed within our local markets may result in increased competition for customer traffic and creditworthy tenants. We may not be able to lease our properties, renew leases, or obtain new tenants to whom space may be re-leased as leases expire, and the terms of renewals or new leases (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Increased competition for tenants may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise planned to make. In addition, our retail centers face competition from alternate forms of retailing, including home shopping networks, mail order catalogues and on-line based shopping services, which may limit the number of retail tenants that desire to seek space in shopping center properties generally. Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property. Those laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the 10 Table of Contents hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation or removal of the substances may be substantial, and the presence of the substances, or the failure to remediate the substances promptly, may adversely affect the owners ability to sell the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of our operating properties and other real estate assets, we may be potentially liable for:  remediation and removal costs; and  damages to persons or property arising from the existence or maintenance of hazardous or toxic substances. The preliminary environmental assessments of our operating properties, investment land and other real estate assets have not revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations, nor are we aware of any liability of that type. Nevertheless, these assessments may not have revealed all environmental liabilities, and we may have material environmental liabilities that we do not know about. Future uses or conditions, including changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, may cause us to have environmental liability. Insurance We carry comprehensive property, general liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our existing properties, with policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties. We carry similar insurance with respect to our properties under development or properties under construction, but with appropriate exceptions given the nature of these properties. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was enacted on November 26, 2002. The law provides that losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism will be partially reimbursed by the United States after a statutory deductible amount is paid by the insurance company providing coverage. The law also requires that the insurance company offer coverage for terrorist acts for an additional premium. We accepted the offer to include this coverage in our property and casualty policies. We believe that our properties are adequately covered by insurance. There are, however, some types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not generally insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose our capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property, and we would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any loss of that kind would adversely affect our operations and financial position. 11 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investors or potential investors in Roberts Realty should carefully consider the risks described below. These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks of which we are presently unaware or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations and hinder our financial performance, including our ability to make distributions to our investors. We have organized our summary of these risks into five subsections:  real estate related risks;  financing risks;  tax risks;  environmental and other legal risks; and  risks for investors in our stock. This section includes forward-looking statements. Real Estate Related Risks Our business currently operates at a loss. We are currently experiencing negative operating cash flow as a result of selling seven residential communities in 2004 and 2005 for $183.1 million while making distributions to investors of $4.50 per share, totaling $32.5 million. We have two stabilized residential properties totaling 403 residential units and three stabilized retail centers totaling 112,322 square feet. In addition, we own two properties currently in lease-up, six properties in the planning and design phase and one parcel of undeveloped land held for investment purposes. These properties are currently producing minimal cash flow. Although we have replaced some of our operating revenues and cash flows by acquiring retail centers in September and October 2005, and we expect that the lease-up of the Addison Place Shops and Northridge office building will contribute positively to our operating revenues and cash flows, we expect that our overall business will continue to operate at a loss as we execute our planned development and construction program and that we will use, rather than generate, net cash in our operating activities through the end of 2007 or until our development projects are constructed and leased. If these losses persist for longer than we expect, our cash position and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Construction risks inherent in the development and construction of new properties could negatively affect our financial performance. We currently estimate that it would take approximately $206 million to develop and construct the residential, office and retail properties we can build on the undeveloped land we now own under their current zoning. (This amount is only an estimate, and it will likely change by a material amount as we develop and construct our properties.) Development and construction costs may exceed our original estimates due to events beyond our control, including:  increased costs for or any unavailability of materials or labor;  building restrictions;  environmental impact studies by the government;  weather delays;  increased interest costs due to rising interest rates; and  any financial instability of the developer (Roberts Properties, Inc., which is owned by Mr. Charles S. Roberts, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of 12 Table of Contents Directors), general contractor (Roberts Properties Construction, Inc., also owned by Mr. Roberts) or any subcontractor. We may also be unable to complete development or construction of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs and loss of rents until the property is ready for occupancy. Additionally, the time required to recoup our development and construction costs and to realize a return, if any, on such costs can be long. Further, we typically enter into construction contracts on a cost plus basis. Because these contracts do not provide for a guaranteed maximum price, we must bear the entire amount of any increase in costs above the amounts we initially estimate, and these costs may be material. We face leasing risks in our planned development and construction program. The success of a real estate development project depends in part on entering into leases with acceptable terms within the lease-up period. If the residential homes or commercial or office space we have constructed is not leased on schedule and upon the expected terms and conditions, the yields, returns and value creation on the project could be adversely impacted. Whether or not tenants are willing to enter into leases on the terms and conditions we project and on the timetable we expect will depend on a large variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. We are currently concentrated in metropolitan Atlanta, and adverse changes in economic or market conditions in Atlanta could negatively affect our financial performance and condition. Currently, all of our properties are located in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. Economic conditions in this area could adversely affect our performance. These factors include:  lack of employment growth;  supply and demand for properties;  neighborhood values in the submarkets in which our properties are located;  zoning and other regulatory conditions;  competition from other properties;  property taxes;  weather problems; and  price increases for materials or labor. In that regard, this region has experienced economic recessions and depressed conditions in the local real estate markets in the past. Deteriorating general economic or social conditions or any natural disasters in this area could materially and adversely affect the value of our portfolio, our results of operations and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and distributions to our investors. We face conflicts of interest because of our business dealings with our Chief Executive Officer and his affiliates. Our business practice is to retain Roberts Properties, Inc. to develop our properties and Roberts Properties Construction, Inc. to construct our properties. Mr. Charles S. Roberts, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, owns all of the equity interests in these companies (the Roberts Companies). We have in the past and may again in the future acquire properties from Mr. Roberts or his affiliates. Although each agreement between Roberts Realty and/or the operating partnership on one hand and Mr. Roberts or his affiliates on the other hand must be approved by our audit committee and the independent members of our board of directors, conflicts of 13 Table of Contents interest inherent in these business transactions could result in our paying more for property or services than we would pay an independent seller or provider. These agreements and transactions have not had and will not have the benefit of arms-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated parties. These arrangements also expose us to the following risks, among others:  the possibility that the Roberts Companies might incur severe financial problems or even become bankrupt;  the possibility that the Roberts Companies may at any time have economic or business interests or goals that are or that become inconsistent with our business interests or goals; or  the possibility that the Roberts Company may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. We face substantial competition. All of our properties are located in developed areas where we face substantial competition from other properties and from other real estate companies that own or may develop or renovate competing properties. The number of competitive properties and real estate companies could have a material adverse effect on our ability to rent our properties, the rents we charge and our acquisition opportunities. In addition, the activities of these competitors and these factors could:  cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid;  prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all;  decrease the rental rates that we would be able to charge in the absence of such direct competition; and  reduce the occupancy rates that we would otherwise be able to achieve. The factors could materially and adversely affect the value of our portfolio, our results of operations and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and distributions to our investors. Favorable conditions for purchasing residential properties could adversely affect our revenues from our residential communities. Our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in our market area and the affordability of owner occupied single and multi-family homes caused by low mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to retain our residents, lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. Changes in market or economic conditions may affect our business negatively. General economic conditions and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect real property income and capital appreciation. We are unable to determine the precise effect that the performance of the worldwide or United States economies will have on us or on the value of our common stock. 14 Table of Contents Terrorism could impair our business. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Attacks that directly affect one or more of our residential or commercial properties could significantly affect our ability to operate those properties and impair our ability to achieve the results we expect. Our insurance coverage may not cover any losses caused by a terrorist attack. In addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the United States economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our commercial and office tenants may go bankrupt or be unable to make lease payments. Our operating revenues from our commercial and office properties depend on entering into leases with and collecting rents from tenants. Economic conditions may adversely affect tenants and potential tenants in our market and, accordingly, could affect their ability to pay rents and possibly to occupy their space. Tenants may experience bankruptcies and various bankruptcy laws may reject those leases or terminate them. If leases expire or end, replacement tenants may not be available upon acceptable terms and conditions. In addition, if the market rental rates are lower than the previous contractual rates, our cash flows and net income could suffer a negative impact. As a result, if a significant number of our commercial or office tenants fail to pay their rent due to bankruptcy, weakened financial condition or otherwise, it would negatively affect our financial performance. Real estate properties are illiquid and may be difficult to sell, particularly in a poor market environment. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which tends to limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other market conditions. Our ability to dispose of assets in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions. We may be unable to sell our properties when we would prefer to do so to raise capital we need to fund our planned development and construction program or to fund distributions to investors. Losses from natural catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage. We carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on our properties, which we believe is customary in amount and type for real property assets. We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties acquired in the future. Some losses, however, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, may be subject to limitations. We may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses. Further, our insurance costs could increase in future periods. If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of the lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it impractical to use insurance proceeds to replace a damaged or destroyed property. Our business depends on key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and key personnel. We face substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry, and the loss of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Roberts, could have an adverse effect on us. We do not carry key person insurance on any of our executive officers or other key employees. 15 Table of Contents If we are unable to lease up our Addison Place Shops and our Northridge office building as we intend, our financial performance and condition could suffer. We currently have two properties, the Addison Place Shops and the Northridge office building, that are in the lease-up phase. The Addison Place Shops are approximately 34% leased, and the Northridge office building is approximately 44% leased. If we are unable to fill the remainder of the properties with tenants as we intend, our financial performance will be adversely affected. Financing Risks We may not be able to obtain the debt and equity we need to carry out our planned development and construction program. We have two stabilized residential properties totaling 403 residential units and three stabilized retail centers totaling 112,322 square feet. We also have two properties in lease-up, six properties in the planning and design phase, and one parcel of undeveloped land held for investment. With respect to the five properties that are now under development, we estimate the total cost of the projects, including development fees and contractor fees payable to the Roberts Companies, to be approximately $206 million, although the exact amount could be materially different. We cannot presently quantify with any precision the amount and timing of our long-term capital needs for development, but the amount we need will be substantial. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise the debt and equity needed to complete our development projects as we intend. If we are unable to obtain long-term debt and equity on favorable terms, we will be unable to carry out our planned development and construction program. We may be unable to refinance our existing debt or we may only be able to do so on unfavorable terms. We are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including:  the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; and  the risk that we will not be able to renew, repay or refinance our debt when it matures or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of that debt. The payment terms contained in each mortgage note secured by one of our properties do not fully amortize the loan balance, and a balloon payment of the balance will be due upon its maturity. In particular, we have four loans totaling $22,435,000 in short-term debt that matures during the next 12 months. If we are unable to refinance our debt at maturity on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. Those losses could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and to pay dividends and distributions to our investors. Further, if we are unable to meet mortgage payments on any mortgaged property, the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property, appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value. Foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. 16 Table of Contents Rising interest rates could materially and adversely affect the cost of our indebtedness. We have incurred and may in the future again incur debt that bears interest at a variable rate. As March 14, 2007, we have approximately $32.2 million in debt that bears interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and distributions to our investors. Increased debt and leverage could affect our financial position and impair our ability to make distributions to our investors. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. We have an informal policy that we will not incur indebtedness in excess of 75% of what the board of directors believes is the fair market value of our assets at any given time. In the future, however, we may re-evaluate our borrowing policies in light of then current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market value of the operating partnerships real estate assets, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors. Modification of this policy may adversely affect the interests of our shareholders. Additional leverage may:  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the REIT industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and  limit, along with the possible financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and distributions to our investors. If we are unable to reinvest sales or refinancing proceeds as quickly as we expect, our financial condition may be adversely affected. We have in the past and may again in the future seek to structure future dispositions as tax-free exchanges, where appropriate, using the non-recognition provisions of Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code to defer income taxation on the disposition of the exchanged property. For an exchange to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, we must meet certain technical requirements. Given the competition for properties meeting our investment criteria, it may be difficult for us to identify suitable properties within the required time frames to meet the requirements of Section 1031. If we are unable to reinvest sales or refinancing proceeds in the period required to defer recognition of taxable gains, we would be required to distribute most of the net proceeds to our shareholders and unitholders, which would adversely affect our ability to carry out our investment strategy. If we incur additional debt, the agreements covering those debts could contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business. Lending agreements will govern any additional debt we may incur for purchasing, developing or constructing properties. Typically, these types of agreements contain various provisions that could limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to: 17 Table of Contents  incur additional debt and issue preferred stock;  pay dividends and make other distributions;  make investments and other payments;  redeem or repurchase our capital stock;  consolidate or merge;  create liens;  sell assets; or  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. If we are unable to pay our obligations to our secured lenders, they could proceed against any or all of the collateral securing our indebtedness to them. In addition, a breach of the restrictions or covenants contained in our loan documents could cause an acceleration of our indebtedness. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay our indebtedness in full upon acceleration. Our interest rate hedging activities may not effectively protect us from fluctuations in interest rates. We generally enter into fixed rate debt instruments for our completed apartment communities. In certain situations, we may utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate exposure on variable-rate debt. We do not use these instruments for trading or speculative purposes, but rather to increase the predictability of our financing costs. If the pricing of new debt instruments is not within the parameters of a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Contracts may also be ineffective when market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than we incur under the hedging contracts. Furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. These charges are typically related to the extent and timing of fluctuations in interest rates. Despite our efforts to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain coverage for all of our outstanding indebtedness at any particular time. If we do not effectively protect from this risk, we may be subject to increased interest costs resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Tax Risks Our company may fail to qualify for REIT status under federal income tax laws. Our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed upon REITs under the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes since our inception in 1994, and we plan to continue to meet the requirements to qualify as a REIT in the future. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. We cannot guarantee, therefore, that we have qualified or will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. The determination that we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new decisions that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and certain relief provisions of the Internal Revenue Code did not apply, we would be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, leaving less money available for distributions to investors. In addition, distributions to shareholders or unitholders in any year in which we 18 Table of Contents failed to qualify would not be deductible for federal income tax purposes. Failing to qualify as a REIT would eliminate our requirement to make distributions to shareholders or unitholders, as well. We would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT, unless we were entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. It is not possible to predict whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to such statutory relief. Our failure to qualify as a REIT likely would have a significant adverse effect on the value of our common stock. Our operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Management believes that our operating partnership qualifies, and has qualified since its formation in 1994, as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. We can provide no assurance, however, that the IRS will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates. In addition, the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Environmental and Other Legal Risks We may have liability under environmental laws. Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties, regardless of our knowledge or responsibility, simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. Therefore, we may have liability with respect to properties we have already sold. If environmental problems arise, we may have to take extensive measures to remedy the problems, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay distributions to our investors because:  we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination;  the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination;  even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and  governmental entities or other third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs. These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the value of the contaminated property. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products and the failure to remediate that contamination properly may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination. We face risks related to mold and asbestos. Recently, there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in real estate. 19 Table of Contents Some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Although our insurance policy currently does not exclude mold-related claims, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain coverage in the future for those claims at a commercially reasonable price or at all. The presence of significant mold could expose us to liability to tenants and others if allegations regarding property damage, health concerns or similar claims arise. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. Those laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:  properly manage and maintain the asbestos;  notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and  undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. Those laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow others to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. We may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities for which we have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the seller. These liabilities can include:  claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties;  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and  claims for indemnification by directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. If we have to expend time and money to deal with these claims, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We face risks in complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. To comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must furnish a report by our management on our internal controls over financial reporting with our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2007. The report will contain, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of that fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting is defined as a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 will also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on managements assessment of our internal controls. We currently expect to begin testing of our internal controls no later than the second quarter of fiscal 2007. This testing will include documenting our procedures and an analysis of the segregation of duties. In the course of our evaluation and testing of internal controls, we may identify areas for improvement in the documentation, design and effectiveness of our internal controls, and these areas of improvement may be material. We may elect or be required to disclose those weaknesses before we have 20 Table of Contents remediated them. Any disclosure of this nature may adversely affect our stock price. We cannot assure you that we will not discover material weaknesses in the course of our testing and be required to disclose them. Given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, we can provide no assurance regarding our conclusions, or regarding the conclusions of our independent auditor, as of December 31, 2007 with respect to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. In any event, we expect to incur material costs in complying with Section 404. Failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other similar laws could result in substantial costs. A number of federal, state and local laws and regulations (including the Americans with Disabilities Act) may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features that add to the cost of buildings under construction. Legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial, and restrictions on construction or completion of renovations may limit implementation of our investment strategy in certain instances or reduce overall returns on our investments, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay distributions to investors and to pay amounts due on our debt. Risks for Investors in Our Stock We do not pay regular quarterly dividends, and we do not anticipate making any distributions to investors for the indefinite future, other than possibly to preserve our REIT status if so required. Unlike other REITs that pay regular monthly or quarterly dividends, we have not paid regular quarterly dividends since the third quarter of 2001, and we presently have no plans to resume paying regular quarterly dividends. Since 2001, we have paid dividends only out of the proceeds of property sales. Particularly in light of our need for capital to fund our planned development and construction program, we anticipate paying distributions out of the proceeds of property sales only if we need to do so to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The market price of our stock is subject to fluctuation as a result of our operating results, the operating results of other REITs and changes in the stock market in general. The trading volumes of our common stock on the American Stock Exchange have historically been relatively light, and the market price may not reflect the fair market value of our common stock (or our net asset value) at any particular moment. Prior sales data do not necessarily indicate the prices at which our common stock would trade in a more active market. The market value of our common stock may be based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and current and future cash dividends, and may be secondarily based upon the real estate market value of our underlying assets. In addition, general market conditions or market conditions of real estate companies in general could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Additional issuances of equity securities may dilute the investment of our current shareholders. Issuing additional equity securities to finance future developments and acquisitions instead of incurring additional debt could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders. Our ability to execute our 21 Table of Contents business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, which could include a line of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, equity financing or joint ventures. Restrictions on changes of control could prevent a beneficial takeover for investors. A number of the provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws have or may have the effect of deterring a takeover of the company. In particular, to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must comply with various requirements and avoid various prohibited events. A company cannot be a REIT if, during the last half of a taxable year, more than 50% in value of its outstanding stock is owned by five or fewer individual shareholders, taking into account certain constructive ownership tests. To help the company comply with that test, Article 5 of our articles of incorporation provides in substance that (a) Mr. Roberts cannot own more than 35% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and (b) no other person can own more than 3.7% of our outstanding common stock. These provisions, which are intended to limit the ownership of our common stock by five persons to no more than 49% of our outstanding shares, have or may have the effect of deterring a takeover of the company. In addition, our articles of incorporation and bylaws have other provisions that have or may have the effect of deterring a takeover of the company, including:  our classified board of directors, which may render more difficult a change in control of the company or removal of incumbent management, because the term of office of only one-third of the directors expires in a given year;  the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock;  provisions in the articles of incorporation to the effect that no transaction of a fundamental nature, including mergers in which the company is not the survivor, share exchanges, consolidations, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, may be effectuated without the affirmative vote of at least three-quarters of the votes entitled to vote generally in any such matter;  provisions in the articles of incorporation to the effect that they may not be amended (except for certain limited matters) without the affirmative vote of at least three-quarters of the votes entitled to be voted generally in the election of directors;  provisions in the bylaws to the effect that they may be amended by either the affirmative vote of three-quarters of all shares outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of the directors, or the affirmative vote of a majority of the companys directors then holding office, unless the shareholders prescribed that any such bylaw may not be amended or repealed by the board of directors;  Georgia anti-takeover statutes under which the company may elect to be protected; and  provisions to the effect that directors elected by the holders of common stock may be removed only by the affirmative vote of shareholders holding at least 75% of all of the votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors. A redemption of units is taxable. Holders of units in our operating partnership should keep in mind that a redemption of units will be treated as a sale of units for federal income tax purposes. The exchanging holder will generally recognize gain in an amount equal to the value of the common shares, plus the amount of liabilities of the operating partnership allocable to the units being redeemed, less the holders tax basis in the units. It is possible that the amount of gain recognized or the resulting tax liability could exceed the value of the shares received in the redemption. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
