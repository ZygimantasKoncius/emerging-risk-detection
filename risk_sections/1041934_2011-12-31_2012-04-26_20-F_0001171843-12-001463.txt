RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this annual report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business. These statements are intended to highlight the material risk factors that may cause actual financial, business, research or operating results to differ materially from expectations disclosed in this annual report. See also factors disclosed under “Cautionary statement on forward-looking information”. Risks Relating to Our Business Our future revenue growth and income depend, among other things, on the success of our HIFU technology. We depend on the success of our High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (“HIFU”) technology for future revenue growth and net income. Our Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (“ESWL”) line of products competes in a mature market that has experienced declining unit sales prices in recent years, although total revenues have remained stable owing to increased sales volumes. In particular, we are dependent on the successful development and commercialization of other product lines, such as medical devices based on HIFU, particularly the Ablatherm, to generate significant additional revenues and achieve and sustain profitability in the future. The Ablatherm is in its commercialization phase in the European Union, Canada and other countries. However, the Ablatherm is not approved for commercial distribution in the United States. In December 2001, our request for an additional Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to conduct clinical trials in the United States for the Ablatherm as a primary therapy was rejected. After redesigning the clinical protocol, we resumed and plan to complete the clinical trials in order to obtain FDA approval of the Ablatherm using the $17.4 million net proceeds of the October 2007 private placement. While we expect these funds to be sufficient to enable us to fund the clinical trials in their entirety, we cannot guarantee that the proceeds will in fact be enough to do so.We can also not guarantee that the FDA will accept the changes to the protocol that we may submit, based upon the December 11, 2009 panel recommendations and our ongoing discussions with the FDA. Finally, we cannot guarantee the successful completion of clinical trials nor can we guarantee that the FDA will grant approval to market a device even if clinical trials are conclusive and/or are successfully completed. See “—Our clinical trials for products using HIFU technology may not be successful” and Item 4, “Information on the Company—HIFU Division—HIFU Division Clinical and Regulatory Status.” Our clinical trials for products using HIFU technology may not be successful. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our devices under development, we must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that the device is safe and effective for use in each indication. The results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not predict the results that will be obtained in large scale clinical trials, and there can be no assurance that our clinical trials will demonstrate that our products are safe, effective, and marketable. Companies can suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. Discussions with regulatory authorities to improve our clinical protocol may prove difficult and lengthy. We, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time and regulating agencies such as the FDA may even refuse to grant exemptions to pursue clinical trials. See Item 4, ‘‘Information on the Company—High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Division—HIFU Division Clinical and Regulatory Status.’’ We rely on scientific, technical and clinical data supplied by academics who work with us to evaluate and develop our devices. We cannot assure investors that there are no errors or omissions in such data that would adversely affect the development of our products. The process of applying for regulatory approval is unpredictable, often lengthy and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Our HIFU devices that have not received regulatory approval may not prove to be effective or safe in clinical trials or may not be approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. If our HIFU devices do not prove to be effective and safe in clinical trials to the satisfaction of the relevant regulatory authorities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 7 HIFU technology may not be accepted and adopted by the medical community. Our HIFU devices represent new therapies for the conditions that they are designed to treat. Notwithstanding any positive clinical results that our HIFU devices may have achieved or may achieve in the future in terms of safety and effectiveness, and any marketing approvals that we may have obtained or may obtain in the future, there can be no assurance that such products will gain acceptance in the medical community. Physician acceptance depends, among other things, on adequate reimbursement from healthcare payers, which has not been provided for our HIFU products in any country, except for full public reimbursement in Germany and Italy and partial reimbursement from private insurers in the United Kingdom, and evidence of the cost effectiveness of a therapy as compared to existing therapies. In February 2011, the French Health Ministry recently granted a special temporary reimbursement for the use of our HIFU technology in the treatment of localized prostate cancer, under certain clinical conditions. French Healthcare Authorities will review the clinical data gathered within the next five years in view of granting definitive reimbursement for HIFU. However, we cannot guarantee that such definitive reimbursement code will be granted. Acceptance by patients depends in part on physician recommendations, as well as other factors, including the degree of invasiveness, the rate and severity of complications and other side effects associated with the therapy as compared to other therapies. Our cash flow is highly dependent on demand for our products. Our cash flow has historically been subject to significant fluctuations over the course of any given financial year due to seasonal demand for medical devices, and the resulting annual and quarterly fluctuations in trade and other receivables and inventories. This has in the past resulted in significant variations in working capital requirements and operating cash flows. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, moreover, our operating cash flow was negative due to the cash requirements of operating activities, which we financed using cash and cash equivalents on hand. In addition, our 2011, 2010 and 2009 operating cash flow was negative due to the working-capital cash requirements, the cash requirements of investing activity to expand our mobile activity and to expand the leasing of our products as part of our revenue-per-procedure (“RPP”) model, and due to the sponsoring of the pre-market approval (‘‘PMA’’) trials for the FDA’s approval of our Ablatherm-HIFU solution for the treatment of prostate cancer in the United States. Since we anticipate relying on cash flow from operating activities to meet our liquidity requirements, a decrease in the demand for our products, or the inability of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us, would reduce the funds available to us. Our future cash flow may also be affected by the expected continued expansion of the leasing of our products, or the continued expansion of our mobile activity (which is invoiced on a RPP basis), since each of these activities generates smaller immediate revenues than device sales, and by the implementation of our U.S. clinical trials to seek the FDA’s approval. In the future, our liquidity may be constrained and our cash flows may be uncertain, negative or significantly different from period to period. Our future cash flow will be affected by increased expenses in sales efforts as well as marketing and promotion tools, while there is no assurance that this will result in the increase in the demand for our products and services. It will also be affected by the expenses to our pre-market approval trial process to seek the FDA’s approval on our Ablatherm-HIFU solution for the treatment of prostate cancer in the United States, while there is no assurance that our cash flow will in fact be enough to do so or that clinical trials will be successful or that the FDA will grant approval to market our device even if the trials are successfully completed. We have a history of operating losses and it is uncertain when and if we will reach profitability. We have incurred operating losses in each fiscal year since 1998 and may never achieve profitability. We expect that our marketing, selling and research and development expenses will increase as we attempt to develop and commercialize our Lithotripsy and HIFU devices. We may not, however, generate a sufficient level of revenue to offset these expenses and may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to respond to any unanticipated decline in revenue. For example, in 2009, we had positive operating income in both HIFU and Urology Devices and Services (“UDS”) divisions which however were not sufficient to offset the cost of the Ablatherm-HIFU FDA PMA trials and the cost of our corporate activities thus resulting in a consolidated operating loss. In 2010 and 2011, we had negative operating income in our HIFU division, reflecting a slowdown in HIFU activity which was not sufficient to offset the fixed costs of the division. We cannot assure investors that we will realize sufficient revenue to become profitable in the future. See Item 5, ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.’’ Competition in the markets in which we operate is intense and is expected to increase in the future. Competition in the markets in which we operate is intense and is expected to increase in the future. In each of our main businesses, we face competition both directly from other manufacturers of medical devices that apply the same technologies that we use, as well as indirectly from existing or emerging therapies for the treatment of urological disorders. 8 We believe that because ESWL has long been the standard treatment for urinary tract calculus disease, competition in that market comes principally from current manufacturers of lithotripters, including Siemens, Storz and Dornier. In the markets that we target for our HIFU products, competition comes from new market entrants and alternative therapies, as well as from current manufacturers of medical devices. In the HIFU market, our devices, in particular the Ablatherm, compete with all current treatments for localized tumors, including surgery, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and cryotherapy. Other companies working with HIFU technology for the minimally invasive treatment of tumors, include USHIFU, which markets a device called the Sonablate SB500 for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Insightec, an Israeli company owned mainly by General Electric and Elbit Medical Imaging Ltd, has developed a device using HIFU technology to treat uterine fibroids. Haifu, a Chinese company, is developing HIFU products addressing various types of cancers. Philips Healthcare is also developing HIFU devices addressing uterine fibroids, breast tumors and drug delivery activated by HIFU. See Item 4, ‘‘Information on the Company—High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Division— HIFU Competition’’ and Item 4, ‘‘Information on the Company—Urology Devices and Services Division.’’ Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, research, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources than us and may have more experience in developing, manufacturing, marketing and supporting new medical devices. In addition, our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a leading position in technological innovation, and we cannot assure investors that we will be able to develop new products or enhance our current ones to compete successfully with new or existing technologies. Rapid technological development by competitors may result in our products becoming obsolete before we recover a significant portion of the research, development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to those products. We also face competition for our maintenance and service contracts. Larger hospitals often utilize their in-house maintenance departments instead of contracting with equipment manufacturers like us to maintain and repair their medical equipment. In addition, third-party medical equipment maintenance companies increasingly compete with equipment manufacturers by offering broad repair and maintenance service contracts to hospitals and clinics. This increased competition for medical devices and maintenance and service contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We operate in a highly regulated industry and our future success depends on government regulatory approval of our products, which we may not receive or which may be delayed for a significant period of time. Government regulation significantly impacts the development and marketing of our products, particularly in the United States. We are regulated in each of our major markets with respect to preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products. To market and sell products still in the clinical trial stage, we are required to obtain approval or clearance from the relevant regulatory agencies, including the FDA, in the United States. In particular, our Ablatherm device is under clinical trials in the U.S. Following the December 11, 2009 panel experts recommendations and our discussions with the FDA, after thoroughly evaluating all options, in April 2010, we decided to discontinue enrollment of patients in the HIFU comparative arm of the study, completed the treatment of 134 patients in June 2010 and then entered into the required 2two-year follow-up phase. Clinical outcomes from these patients combined with our European long-term database will form the foundation of a submission to the FDA which we expect to occur at the end of 2012. Consequently, we may not be able to follow the FDA recommendations with regards to our prospective study and its cryoablation comparative arm and to conduct our trials within the timeframe and budget we initially expected. Even if regulatory approval to market a product, if is granted, it may include limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Regulatory policy may change and additional government regulations may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products. Any delay, failure to receive regulatory approval or the loss of previously received approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the regulation of our business, see Item 4, ‘‘Information on the Company—Government Regulation’’ and “High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Division—HIFU Division Clinical and Regulatory Status.” Furthermore, changes to regulatory policy or the adoption of additional statutes or regulations that affect our business could impose substantial additional costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The success of our products depends on whether procedures performed by those products are eligible for reimbursement which depends on the decisions of national health authorities and third-party payers. Our success depends, among other things, on the extent to which reimbursement can be obtained from 9 healthcare payers in the United States and elsewhere for procedures performed with our products. In the United States, we are dependent upon favorable decisions by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (‘‘CMS’’), formerly the Health Care Financing Administration (‘‘HCFA’’), for Medicare reimbursement, individual managed care organizations, private insurers and other payers. These decisions may be revised from time to time, which could affect reimbursement for procedures performed using our devices. Outside the United States, and in particular in the European Union and Japan, third-party reimbursement is generally conditioned upon decisions by national health authorities. In the European Union, there is no harmonized procedure for obtaining reimbursement and, consequently, we must seek regulatory approval in each Member State. If we fail to establish reimbursement from healthcare payers or government and private healthcare payers’ policies change, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Lithotripsy procedures currently are reimbursed by public healthcare systems in the European Union, in Japan and in the United States. However, a decision in any of those countries to modify reimbursement policies for these procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. In contrast, procedures performed with our Ablatherm device are not reimbursed in the European Union with the exception of Italy, Germany, the UK and on a special temporary basis in France, where procedures are partially reimbursed by either public healthcare systems or private insurers. We cannot assure investors that additional reimbursement approvals will be obtained in the near future. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable, limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed. Our manufacturing operations are highly regulated and failure to comply with those regulations would harm our business. Our manufacturing operations must comply with regulations established by regulatory agencies in the United States, the European Union and other countries, and in particular with the good manufacturing practices (‘‘GMP’’) mandated by the FDA and European Union standards for quality assurance and manufacturing process control. Since such standards may change, we may not, at all times, comply with all applicable standards and, as a result would be unable to manufacture our products for commercial sale. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by regulatory authorities at any time. If any inspection by the regulatory authorities reveals deficiencies in manufacturing, we could be required to take immediate remedial actions, suspend production or close the current and future production facilities, which would disrupt our manufacturing processes. Accordingly, failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on a single site to manufacture our products, and any interruption of operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Most of our manufacturing currently takes place in a single facility located in Vaulx-en-Velin, on the outskirts of Lyon, France. A significant interruption in the operations of our sole facility for any reason, such as fire, flood or other natural disaster or a failure to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For certain components or services we depend on a single supplier who, due to events beyond our control may fail to deliver sufficient supplies to us or increase the cost of items supplied, which would interrupt our production processes or negatively impact our results of operations. We purchase the majority of the components used in our products from a number of suppliers, but rely on a single supplier for some key components. In addition, we rely on single suppliers for certain services. If the supply of certain components or services were interrupted for any reason, our manufacturing and marketing of the affected products would be delayed. These delays could be extensive, especially in situations where a component substitution would require regulatory approval. In addition, such suppliers could decide unilaterally to increase the price of supplied items and therefore cause additional charges for the Company. We expect to continue to depend upon our suppliers for the foreseeable future. Failure to obtain adequate supplies of components or services in a timely manner and at the agreed price could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Intellectual property rights are essential to protect our medical devices, and any dispute with respect to these rights could be costly and have an uncertain outcome. Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to establish and protect the related intellectual property rights, without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. The validity and scope of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, the outcome of such claims may be highly uncertain. The medical device industry has been 10 characterized by extensive patents and other intellectual property rights litigation. Our products, including our HIFU devices, may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming and may result in a significant diversion of effort and resources by our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination in any such litigation or proceeding to which we become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties and pay ongoing royalties, require us to redesign certain products or subject us to injunctions preventing the manufacture, use or sale of the affected products. In addition to being costly, drawn-out litigation to defend or prosecute intellectual property rights could cause our customers or potential customers to defer or limit their purchase or use of our products until the litigation is resolved. See Item 4, ‘‘Information on the Company—High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Division—HIFU Division Patents and Intellectual Property’’ and Item 4, ‘‘Information on the Company—Urology Devices and Services Division—UDS Division Patents and Intellectual Property.’’ We own patents covering several of our technologies and have additional patent applications pending in the United States, the European Union, Japan and elsewhere. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and there can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot assure investors that our current or future patents are or will be sufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Our patents or patent applications could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future. The failure to maintain or obtain necessary patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights from third parties on acceptable terms or the invalidation or cancellation of material patents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Our competitors, many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may apply for and obtain patents that will interfere with our ability to make, use or sell certain products, including our HIFU devices, either in the United States or in foreign markets. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which we seek to protect through non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. It is possible, however, that those non-disclosure agreements will be breached, that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets will become known to, or independently developed by, competitors. Litigation may be necessary to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain countries. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. We face a significant risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury or death. Our products are designed to be used in the treatment of severe affections and conditions. Despite the use of our products, patients may suffer personal injury or death, and we may, as a result, face significant product liability claims. We maintain separate product liability insurance policies for the United States and Canada and for the other markets in which we sell our products. Product liability insurance is expensive and there can be no assurance that it will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, our insurance may not cover certain product liability claims or our liability for any claims may exceed our coverage limits. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, or any claim or product recall that results in significant cost to or adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign the product. We sell our products in many parts of the world and, as a result, our business is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk because the mix of currencies in which our costs are denominated is different from the mix of currencies in which we earn our revenue. In 2011, approximately 78% of our total costs of sales and operating expenses were denominated in euro, while approximately 39% of our sales were denominated in currencies other than euro (primarily the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen). Our operating profitability could be materially adversely affected by large fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the euro and other currencies. For instance, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar or the Japanese yen against the euro would have a negative effect on our revenues, which may not be offset by an equal reduction in operating expenses and would therefore negatively impact operating profitability. From time to time we enter into foreign exchange forward sale 11 contracts to hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rates of the principal foreign currencies in which our receivables are denominated (in particular, the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen), but there can be no assurance that such hedging activities will limit the effect of movements in exchange rates on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding hedging instruments. In addition, since any dividends that we may declare will be denominated in euro, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of any dividends received by holders of ADSs. Finally, in the specific context of the sovereign debt crisis affecting certain European countries, the alleged or actual disruption in the use of the euro as currency in one or more European Monetary Union countries and the associated fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material effect on our financial condition and earnings, the magnitude and consequences of which are unpredictable. For more information concerning our exchange rate exposure, see “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Our results of operations have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and results of clinical trials, changes in healthcare reimbursement policies, seasonality of demand for our products, changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors, new product announcements by us or our competitors, customer order deferrals in anticipation of new or enhanced products offered by us or our competitors, product quality problems and exchange rate fluctuations. Furthermore, because our main products have relatively high unit prices, the amount and timing of individual orders can have a substantial effect on our results of operations in any given quarter. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the adverse economic and financial developments. The current economic and financial environment has affected the level of public and private spending in the healthcare sector generally. A cautious or negative business outlook may cause our customers to further delay or cancel investment in medical equipment, which would adversely affect our revenues. In addition, we rely on the credit market to secure dedicated lease financings to fund the development of our RPP activity. Due to the limited availability of lending in the current market environment, we may be unable to access sufficient lease financing. Without lease financing, we may be unable to continue the development of our RPP activity or we may need to fund such activity out of our existing working capital. Similarly, some of our clients rely on lease financing to finance their purchases of equipment. Limited availability of lease financing facilities may also affect their purchasing decisions and may adversely impact our equipment sales. On January 19, 2012, we entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with all of the holders of our outstanding 9% Senior Convertible Debentures due October 29, 2012 and Warrant holders, whereby all October 2007 Convertible Debentures and Warrants were exchanged for $10.0 million of new non-convertible debentures (the “New Debentures”), 1,948,871 newly issued ordinary shares, 408,691 new warrants (the “January 2012 Warrants”) and US$ 500,000 in cash. See Item 8 “Financial Information–Significant Changes as of April 26, 2012- January 2012 Exchange Agreement). In accordance with the terms of our the New Debentures, until October 29, 2012, the Company has the option to pay interest on the New Debentures in shares. Following that date, the holders of New Debentures can elect to receive interest payments in shares or in cash. The current economic and financial environment has adversely affected and may continue to affect our share price, thus we may be unable to make payment in shares without significantly diluting the interest of the existing shareholders. If we are unable to issue shares on reasonable terms or if holder of New Debentures so elect, we may need to make interest payments in cash, thus negatively affecting our working capital. If any of the above materializes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 12 Risks Relating to the outstanding warrants and New Debentures We may have to pay liquidated damages to the holders participating in the Exchange, which would increase our expenses and reduce our cash resources. In connection with the issuance of New Debentures and January 2012 Warrants, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Right Agreement”). Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, subject to certain limited exceptions, if the registration statement to which the Registration Rights Agreement relates has not been declared effective within the time periods specified in the Registration Rights Agreement or we otherwise fail to comply with certain provisions set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, we will be required to pay the holders participating in the exchange, as liquidated damages, 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount of October 2007 Convertible Debentures exchanged by each such holder in the Exchange Agreement for each 30-day period (or a pro rata portion thereof) during which such failure continues. There can be no assurance that the registration statement to which the Registration Rights Agreement relates will be declared effective by the SEC or will remain effective for the time periods necessary to avoid payment of liquidated damages. Any payment of liquidated damages would increase our expenses, reduce our cash resources and may limit or preclude us from advancing our product candidates through clinical trials or otherwise growing our business. If we are required for any reason to repay our outstanding New Debentures prior to their maturity date, we would be required to deplete our working capital or raise additional funds. Our failure to repay the New Debentures, if required, could result in legal action against us, which could require the sale of substantial assets. The New Debentures are due and payable on June 30, 2014, unless reimbursed earlier. Any event of default could require the early repayment of the New Debentures at the mandatory default amount, including all other amounts of interest, costs, expenses and liquidated damages due in respect of the defaulted New Debentures. If, prior to the maturity date, we are required to repay the outstanding New Debentures in full, we would be required to use our working capital and raise and/or borrow additional funds. Such additional funds may be difficult to obtain on acceptable terms, if at all, and any issuance of equity or debt financings may contain terms that are not favorable to shareholders of the Company or are dilutive. If we were unable to repay the New Debentures when required, the New Debentures holders could commence legal action against us to recover the amounts due. Any such action would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may limit or preclude us from advancing our product candidates through clinical trials or otherwise growing our business. The issuance of ADSs upon exercise of outstanding warrants and in payment of interest on the New Debentures will cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. The issuance of ADSs upon exercise of the warrants issued in March 2012 (the “March 2012 Warrants”) and the January 2012 Warrants (together, the “Warrants”) will result in dilution of other shareholders since the selling shareholders may ultimately sell the full amount of ADSs issuable on exercise. Based on the number of outstanding Warrants issued, up to 1,983,691 ADSs are issuable upon exercise, representing approximately 10.9% of our issued and outstanding share capital. In addition, interest on the New Debentures is payable, under certain circumstances, in ordinary shares or ADSs, under a formula which is tied to the trading price of our ADSs, and under which there is no upper limit of shares that may be required to be issued in payment of interest. Although no single selling shareholder may exercise its Warrants if such exercise would cause it to own more than 9.99% of our outstanding ordinary shares, this restriction does not prevent each selling shareholder from exercising a portion of its holdings and selling those securities. In this way, each selling shareholder could sell more than this limit while never holding more than this limit. On May 24, 2011, our shareholders adopted several new resolutions and extended the validity of existing ones, allowing the Board of Directors to renegotiate our indebtedness with the maximum flexibility hence authorizing the issuance of a maximum of 10 million new shares. Based on these resolutions and in view of our debt restructuring and new projects financing, we filed a Form F-3 registration statement with the SEC on October 7, 2011 to register ordinary shares and warrants for a maximum amount of $30 million, hence providing for registration of any future new ordinary shares issued for the purpose of raising capital or debt restructuring. This registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 21, 2011. 13 We issued and registered shares and warrants under this registration statement on March 28, 2012. For more information regarding the March 2012 placement, see Item 8 “Financial Information–Significant Changes as of April 26, 2012.” The sale of ADSs issued upon exercise of the Warrants could encourage short sales by third parties which could further depress the price of our ADSs. Any downward pressure on the price of ADSs caused by the sale of ADS issued upon the exercise of the Warrants could encourage short sales by third parties. In a short sale, a prospective seller borrows shares from a shareholder or broker and sells the borrowed shares. The prospective seller hopes that the share price will decline, at which time the seller can purchase shares at a lower price for delivery back to the lender. The seller profits when the share price declines because it is purchasing shares at a price lower than the sale price of the borrowed shares. Such sales could place downward pressure on the price of our ADSs by increasing the number of ADSs being sold, which could further contribute to any decline in the market price of our ADSs. Our total outstanding indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations. Our total consolidated long-term financial debt as of December 31, 2011 was €8.2 million and represented approximately 25% of our total assets, including the current portion of indebtedness of approximately €7.5 million as of that date. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including: • Reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; and • Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy. Provisions in the New Debentures could discourage an acquisition of us or an investment in us by a third party, even if the acquisition or investment would be favorable to investors. If we are party to a “fundamental transaction” or “change of control” (as defined in the New Debenture) or agree to dispose of in excess of 40% of our assets, the holders have the right to require us to redeem the New Debentures at their election shortly after they are notified of such a change. Any redemption under these circumstances will be at a premium equal to the higher of 130% of the then-outstanding principal amount of the New Debenture, plus 100% of accrued and unpaid interest, and other amounts, costs, expenses and liquidated damages due in respect of the New Debentures. In addition, under the terms of the New Debentures, for so long as the New Debentures are outstanding, in the event we issue any new securities or other indebtedness for cash in a transaction primarily for the purpose of raising capital, then we shall be required to apply 40% of the net proceeds to redeem the New Debentures for cash. Risks Relating to Ownership of Securities Our securities may be affected by volume fluctuations, and may fluctuate significantly in price. Our ADSs are currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. The average daily trading volume of our ADSs in December 2011 was 33,082, the high and low bid price of our ADSs for the last two financial years ended on December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, was $ 5.68 and $6.97, and $ 1.37 and $1.89, respectively. Our ADSs have experienced, and are likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our ADSs without regard to our operating performance. For example, average daily trading volume of our ADSs in December 2010 was 528,234 as opposed to 33,082 for the same period of 2011. The price of our securities, and our ADSs in particular, may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including changes in our business, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations, results of clinical trials of our products or those of our competitors, developments in patents and other proprietary rights, and general market and economic conditions. 14 We may issue additional securities that may be dilutive to our existing shareholders. As set forth above, on May 24, 2011, our shareholders adopted resolutions allowing the Board of Directors to issue new shares when renegotiating our indebtedness, only within the maximum 10 million additional share limit, such limit is to be considered taking into account as of April 13 2012, the issuance of new shares following the January 2012 Exchange Agreement, payments of quarterly interests paid in shares and the issuance of new shares following our March 2012 placement, thereby reducing the maximum number authorized to be issued to 1,511,957. The issuance of additional ordinary shares , including any additional ordinary shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of preferential subscription rights that may not be available to all of our shareholders, would reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of then-existing shareholders. We are subject to different corporate disclosure standards that may limit the information available to holders of our ADSs. As a foreign private issuer, we are not required to comply with the notice and disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act, relating to the solicitation of proxies for shareholder meetings. Although we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the periodic disclosure required of foreign private issuers under the Exchange Act is more limited than the periodic disclosure required of U.S. issuers. Therefore, there may be less publicly available information about us than is regularly published by or about other public companies in the United States. We currently do not intend to pay dividends, and cannot assure shareholders that we will make dividend payments in the future. We have never paid any dividend on our shares and do not anticipate paying any dividends for the foreseeable future. In particular, in connection with the January 2012 Exchange Agreement, we undertook not to pay cash dividends on any of our equity securities as long as any New Debentures remain outstanding. Thereafter, declaration of dividends on our shares will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, if any, the operating and financial condition of our business, our capital requirements, general business conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. See Item 8, “Financial Information—Dividends and Dividend Policy.” Judgments of U.S. courts, including those predicated on the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, may not be enforceable in French courts. An investor in the United States may find it difficult to: • effect service of process upon or obtain jurisdiction over us or our non-U.S. resident directors and officers in the United States; • enforce U.S. court judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our non-U.S. resident directors and officers in France; or the United States; • bring an original action in a French court to enforce liabilities based upon the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our non-U.S. resident directors and officers.; or Holders of ADSs have fewer rights than shareholders and must act through the Depositary to exercise those rights. Holders of ADSs do not have the same rights as shareholders and accordingly, cannot exercise rights of shareholders against us. The Bank of New York Mellon, as Depositary (the “Depositary”), is the registered shareholder of the deposited shares underlying the ADSs, and therefore holders of ADSs will generally have to exercise the rights attached to those shares through the Depositary. We have used and will continue to use reasonable efforts to request that the Depositary notify the holders of ADSs of upcoming votes and ask for voting instructions from them. If a holder fails to return a voting instruction card to the Depositary by the date established by it for receipt of such voting instructions, or if the Depositary receives an improperly completed or blank voting instruction card, or if the voting instructions included in the voting instruction card are illegible or unclear, then such holder will be deemed to have instructed the Depositary to vote its shares and the Depositary shall vote such shares in favor of any resolution proposed or approved by our Board of Directors and against any resolution not so proposed or approved. 15 Preferential subscription rights may not be available for U.S. persons. Under French law, shareholders have preferential rights to subscribe for cash issuances of new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire additional shares on a pro rata basis. U.S. holders of our securities may not be able to exercise preferential subscription rights for their shares unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is effective with respect to such rights or an exemption from the registration requirements imposed by the Securities Act is available. We may, from time to time, issue new shares or other securities giving rights to acquire additional shares (such as warrants) at a time when no registration statement is in effect and no Securities Act exemption is available. If so, U.S. holders of our securities will be unable to exercise their preferential rights and their interests will be diluted. We are under no obligation to file any registration statement in connection with any issuance of new shares or other securities. For holders of ADSs, the Depositary may make these rights or other distributions available to holders after we instruct it to do so and provide it with evidence that it is legal to do so. If we fail to do this and the Depositary determines that it is impractical to sell the rights, it may allow these rights to lapse. In that case the holders of ADSs will receive no value for them. Auditors in various non-U.S. jurisdictions, including France, are not inspected by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) and, as a result, there is a risk that quality improvements or deficiencies that could be identified by a PCAOB inspection will not be identified or addressed. The independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included in this Annual Report on Form 20-F is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections, including reviewing of work papers and interviews, by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and applicable professional standards. Because our auditor is located in France, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the French authorities, our auditor is not currently inspected by the PCAOB. Our auditor is, however, subject to regular inspections by the Haut Conseil du commissariat aux comptes, a comparable French regulatory body, that are similar in scope to the PCAOB inspections. During its inspections, the PCAOB may identify deficiencies in an accounting firm’s audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. Since the PCAOB cannot conduct inspections in France, the PCAOB is prevented from regularly evaluating our auditor’s audits and quality control procedures. As a result, investors in our securities may be deprived of any benefits that would have been realized as a result of PCAOB inspections and, depending on the circumstances, investors in our securities could lose confidence in our control procedures, financial statements or, more generally, in the quality of our reported financial information.
