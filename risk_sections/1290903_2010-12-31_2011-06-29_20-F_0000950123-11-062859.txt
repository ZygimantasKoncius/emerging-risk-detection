Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our BusinessWe may not use our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments effectively. On May 16, 2011, we received net proceeds of approximately US$125.6 million from the issuance and sale of our ordinary shares and high-vote ordinary shares to TCH Sapphire and the issuance and sale of our ordinary shares to Expedia Asia Pacific. Accordingly, as of May 31, 2011, we held total cash and cash equivalents of RMB1,086.0 million (US$167.6 million), restricted cash of RMB61.4 million (US$9.5 million) and short-term investments of RMB691.6 million (US$106.8 million). The increase in our total cash may lead to larger fluctuations in our interest income and exchange rate risk in future years, than the discussion above which is with respect to our cash balance as of December 31, 2010.

Limitation on Liability and Other Indemnification Matters Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a companys articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our articles of association provide for indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such, but the indemnity does not extend to any matter in respect of any willful neglect or intentional malfeasance which may be attached to such person.

The following table summarizes, as of May 31, 2011, the outstanding options granted under the 2004 Plan to our current employees and directors.

These options were granted to Mr. Tang on July 23, 2004, are fully-vested, have an exercise price of $5.25 per ordinary share option and expire on August 10, 2011, which is 60 days after the date on which Mr. Tang ceased to be a member of our Board of Directors. Performance Units Granted under the 2004 Plan Performance units are awards in the form of units that are denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of our ordinary shares, which number of units are determined based on the fair market value of our ordinary shares which, when vested, are settled, in either ordinary shares or cash. At the time of grant, our board of directors or the compensation committee determines if we will settle the performance units in cash, stock or both. Settlement terms of performance units, once established, may only be changed by approval of our board of directors or the compensation committee. Except for the performance units granted to our non-employee directors which are to be settled in cash (and are not reflected in the table below), performance units granted to our employees are settled in ordinary shares. The performance units granted during 2010 to our non-employee directors are to be settled upon vesting in cash in an amount equal to the number of the vested performance units multiplied by the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the applicable vesting date. The fair market value of the performance units is determined based upon the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date. Our performance units are subject to service-based vesting where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests. Typically, a portion of the performance units granted vest periodically over the term of the grant. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Plan, unless otherwise determined by our board of directors, if, during the one-year period following a change in control, the performance unit holder incurs a termination of employment by us other than by reason of death, disability or cause or the performance unit holder resigns for good reason, such holder shall be entitled as of the termination of employment to an additional 12 months of vesting of the performance unit to the extent unvested as of the termination of employment. The following table summarizes, as of May 31, 2011, the unvested and outstanding performance units granted to our current employees and directors under the 2004 Plan.

The 2009 Plan was adopted by our Board of Directors on May 13, 2009, was amended to allow grants to our Directors and adopted by our shareholders on December 30, 2009, and was amended by our Board of Directors on March 17, 2011 to increase the total number of authorized shares from 3,000,000 to 6,000,000. Under the 2009 Plan, as amended, the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors may grant stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares or performance units to our employees, directors, officers or consultants. The terms of the 2009 Plan differ from those of the 2004 Plan in some respects, including but not limited to, the following:  Upon the occurrence of a change in control, the 2009 Plan provides for immediate vesting of the then outstanding options or other equity grants under the 2009 Plan to employees with the rank of Vice President or above; and  Within two years following the date of a change of control, if the employment of a recipient of an award under the 2009 Plan is terminated or resigns for good reason (as defined under the 2009 Plan), such employees options and other equity grants would vest. Change of control is defined in the 2009 Plan to include (i) the acquisition or control of the majority of our voting power by a person or group other than Barry Diller, Liberty Media, Expedia and their respective affiliates; (ii) announcement by a person of a going private transaction or other transaction which will result in our ordinary shares or ADSs no longer being publicly listed; and (iii) certain other types of business combinations or sales or dispositions of the majority of our assets. Our board of directors adopted the 2009 Plan on May 13, 2009 and amended the 2009 Plan on March 17, 2011 without seeking prior shareholder approval, as permitted under our articles of association and the law of the Cayman Islands. We have notified the Nasdaq stock market of the Companys decision to use home country practice with respect to the adoption of employee equity incentive plans such as the 2009 Plan. See Item 16G: Corporate Governance. On December 30, 2009, at our annual general meeting of shareholders, our shareholders amended the 2009 Plan to allow grants to members of our Board of Directors and approved the 2009 Plan as so amended. The specific terms of each grant made to an employee are contained in a stock option agreement which we enter into with the employee. Under the terms of the relevant stock option agreements, the grants we made to our employees on March 9, 2010 and March 7, 2011 do not immediately vest upon the announcement by a person of a going private transaction or other transaction which will result in our ordinary shares or ADSs no longer being publicly listed. - 53 - Table of Contents As of May 31, 2011, we had granted 3,984,210 stock options to our current employees which were outstanding and have not been exercised under the 2009 Plan.

Options Granted to Expedia Asia Pacific In August 2004, we granted to Expedia Asia Pacific an option to purchase 711,429 ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$5.25 per share. The option mirrors the terms and conditions of the 1.66 million options granted to certain of our employees and officers on July 23, 2004 under our 2004 Plan. The option becomes exercisable by Expedia Asia Pacific each time any such officer or employee exercises any of such 1.66 million options. In connection with each exercise by an employee or officer, Expedia Asia Pacific is entitled to exercise a portion of its option such that Expedia Asia Pacific would receive (if Expedia Asia Pacific exercises to the fullest extent in connection with such employee or officer exercise) 30% of the aggregate ordinary shares issued to such employee or officer and Expedia Asia Pacific in connection with such employee or officer exercise. To the extent that any such officers or employees options terminate or expire without being exercised, an amount of Expedia Asia Pacifics option equal to 30% of (i) such officers or employees terminated or expired options divided by (ii) 0.70, will likewise terminate or expire.
