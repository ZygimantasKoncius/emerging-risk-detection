Risk Factors and elsewhere in this document. You should read the following discussion together with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. Note 36 to our consolidated financial statements describes the principal differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP as they relate to us and reconciles our net income and shareholders equity. General Taken as a whole, our operations are not seasonal because of our geographic diversity of operations and mix of upstream and downstream projects. Individual contracts, however, may be subject to seasonality, primarily due to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity, particularly in the North Sea, Canada and Gulf of Mexico. In addition, our upstream oil and gas activity is typically characterized as a cyclical industry. To date, however, our business in this sector has shown relatively steady growth, primarily due to relatively robust global economic conditions and a generally higher level of prices worldwide for hydrocarbons. Changes in Scope of Consolidation We have made significant acquisitions and dispositions, which are material to your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We describe below the principal changes in our scope of consolidation occurring between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2006. Coflexip Acquisition Year 2006 The residual goodwill of Coflexip resulting from the two stages of the acquisition remaining after allocation to identified assets and liabilities was allocated to two business segments: Offshore SURF and Offshore Facilities.  The first one concerns Offshore Facilities that relates mainly to the Aker Maritimes Deepwater division acquired by Coflexip in 2001; and  The second one concerns Offshore SURF (Subsea, Umbilicals, Risers and Flowlines) and corresponds to the main activity of Coflexip before the acquisition of Aker: Goodwill net under IFRS, related to the Offshore Facilities segment  304.6 million Goodwill net under IFRS, related to the Offshore SURF segment  1.931 billion The two amounts of goodwill resulting from the allocation to the two principal business segments of Coflexip were the subject of an impairment test according to the method of cash flows converted to a current value (see Note 1C(f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The book value of the goodwill as of December 31, 2006 was confirmed by the impairment test. The main evolutions on former Coflexip goodwill were the following in 2006:  The decrease of the Offshore SURF goodwill by 8.0 million due to the classification of Perry Slingsby Systems Inc and Perry Slingsby Systems Ltd in assets held for sale; and  The decrease of the Offshore SURF goodwill by 9.0 million due to the use of tax losses unrecorded before as deferred tax assets. 48 Table of Contents Year 2005 The unique 2005 variation on former Coflexip goodwill consisted in the decrease of the offshore surf goodwill by 18.3 million due to the sales of GMF assets. Other Changes in Scope of Consolidation Year 2006 In 2006, the assets of Gulf Marine Fabricators were sold and the gain on the disposition amounts to 20.3 million. Year 2005 In 2005, no material change in the scope of consolidation occurred. Only three entities entered the consolidation scope, Technip South Africa (subsidiary controlled at 51%), Technip Marine Sdn. Bhd (subsidiary controlled at 90%) and Technipetrol Hellas (subsidiary controlled at 99%). 2005 was also characterized by the termination of pharmaceutical activities in the U.S. through the liquidation in progress of Technip Biopharm at the end of July 2005, the disposition of Technip Engineering Brunei on September 30, 2005 and the sale of the 83.75% interest in Technip Portugal to its management at the end of December 2005, without any significant impact on net income from continuing operations. Over the year 2005, new legal entities were created to support contracts in joint ventures: CTJV and CTEP (Qatargas 2) in Qatar, CTJV and CTEP (Rasgas 3) also in Qatar, Yemgas FZCO in Yemen, Technip Consortium (Dung Quat) in Vietnam, HT JV (Koniambo) in New Caledonia and TPVI (Hovensa) in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Year 2004 During 2004, we disposed of two companies, EHR and IG SpA and partially disposed of a third, KTI SpA. Our German business EHR was sold on April 7, 2004 for 12.2 million, generating a net gain of 2.3 million. Our Italian business IG SpA was sold on April 23, 2004 for 2.0 million, generating a net gain of 0.7 million. In anticipation of these dispositions, EHR and IG SpA were deconsolidated on January 1, 2004. In a third disposition, 75% of the KTI shares were transferred to a holding controlled by employees during November 2004. We did not generate a gain in this transaction. We consolidated KTI pursuant to the equity method of accounting as of December 31, 2004 with retrospective effect as from January 1, 2004, as we continue to hold 25% of KTIs share capital. Finally, we transferred assets of Technip Offshore Moorings Inc. Company without any gain at the end of 2004. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to your understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Because the application of these policies requires the exercise of significant judgment by us, their application is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We believe that the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments by us and affect estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenues and Cost Recognition Because most of our revenues are generated under long-term contracts, the performance of which generally exceeds two fiscal years, the manner in which we recognize revenues and costs on these contracts is material to your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. Backlog represents the total amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future as a result of performing work under signed contracts which are in force. Typically, on multi-annual contracts, no more than approximately 25% of the revenue from a new contract is recognized within the first year from the date of the order intake of that 49 Table of Contents contract. Consequently, the amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal year in which order intake occurs depends not only on the size of a contract but also on how late in the fiscal year the order intake occurred in order for earned income to be generated prior to the end of the fiscal year. The majority of our revenue is generated by two- to three-year contracts, with earned revenue recognized according to the percentage of completion of the various items of the contract. Our revenue recognition accounting policy is based on the percentage-of-completion method on a contract-by-contract basis, except for some non-significant contracts for which revenue is recognized when the service has been rendered. The percentage-of-completion ratio is computed consistently for each and every homogenous type of contracts as follows:  For all contracts, which include construction services subjected to performance commitments (lump-sum turnkey contracts), the percentage-of-completion is based on technical milestones defined for the main components of the contracts, once their progress is deemed sufficient which is typically a 20% to 25% level of completion;  For other construction contracts, the percentage-of-completion is recognized based on the ratio between costs incurred to date and estimated total costs at completion. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires us to make estimates of our future gross margin under the related contract. We estimate future gross margin based on a combination of factors, including periodic project management reviews, our experience in the businesses and in the geographical region in which we operate, and market condition in that region. From the signing of lump-sum turnkey long-term contracts to the completion of early phases such as engineering design, confirmation of significant orders and assurance that field conditions are satisfactory, it is necessary to firmly assess identified risks and to estimate with sufficient precision the total future costs as well as the expected timetable. As a result, we recognize any related positive gross margin once the projected gross margin can be estimated more precisely, contract by contract. In accordance with our procedures, throughout the lives of our long-term contracts we review and periodically revise their gross margins. For further information, see Note 1C(b) to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Assumptions Pension assumptions are significant inputs to actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two critical assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. Other assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. This rate is the yield on high-quality fixed income investments. The impact of a plus or minus 1% change in health care cost trend rates is described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of a plus or minus 1% change in the expected return on plan assets would have a positive / negative impact of  0.8 million on the 2007 costs. The impact of a plus 1% change in the discount rate would produce a decrease of 0.8 million on the 2007 costs while a minus 1% change in the discount rate would produce an increase of 1.5 million on the 2007 costs. Deferred Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves our estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future 50 Table of Contents taxable income, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. If we continue to operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results. Impairment Tests of Goodwill Goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. This impairment test enables us to determine whether its carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGU) for the purpose of impairment testing. Each of these CGU corresponds to the Groups businesses, representing independent cash-generating flows. The recoverable amount is the higher of selling prices and values in use related to CGU. The latter corresponds to the discounted future cash flows forecasted for these CGU. The discounted future cash flows are calculated on a ten-year basis. Free cash flow is derived from net income before depreciation. In the third quarter, we ask every CGU to provide us with a three-year business plan including order intake, revenue and margin. Depreciations are estimated on the existing assets plus a three-year capital expenditures plan. Capital expenditures beyond the first three years are derived from the initial three-year plan and the assessment of the required capacity to meet forecasted revenues growth. We also perform sensitivity analyses on main assumptions with regards to impairments tests, in order to ensure that no reasonable change of an hypothesis on which the Group has determined its CGUs recoverable value, jeopardizes the conclusions of the impairment tests. As indicated in Note 1 C.(d) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in addition to the annual goodwill impairment test, timely impairment tests may be carried out in the event of indications of reduction in the value of intangible assets held. Possible impairments are based on discounted future cash flows and/or the fair value of the assets concerned. A change in market conditions or in the future cash flows initially calculated could lead us to review and change the impairment loss previously recorded. Stock-Based Compensation In accordance with IFRS 2, stock options correspond to services granted to holders and represent an additional benefit given by the Group. This supplementary benefit is recognized as follows: the fair value of the granted stock options  corresponding to the services rendered by the employees against the options received  is estimated at the grant date and recorded under the equity line item. The fair value of the stock options is evaluated as per the Cox Ross Rubinstein binomial model. That model takes into account the features of the stock option plan (net price, period of exercise), the market data at the grant date (risk-free rate, volatility, share price) and behavioral assumptions on stock options holders. Contingent Liabilities We are involved in legal or arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters, it is often difficult to predict the final outcome. The cases and claims against us often raise difficult and complex legal issues. We accrue liability when, without respect to our view of the merits, we conclude that in a pending proceeding an adverse outcome is a significant possibility and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instrument, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 (SFAS 155). SFAS 155 amends FASB Statements No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), and No 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of 51 Table of Contents Liabilities (SFAS 140). SFAS 155, among other things, permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS 155 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In March 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 156 Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets  An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 156). SFAS 156 amends SFAS 140 with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS 156 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. We do not believe the standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as reconciled to U.S. GAAP. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty In Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 106). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance or derecognition, classification, interests and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact FIN 48 will have on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statements No. 157 Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). This pronouncement defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS 157 will have on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 1N (SAB 108), Financial Statements  Considering the Effects or Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which is effective for calendar-year companies as of December 31, 2006. SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the financial statements are materially misstated. Under the guidance, companies should take into account both the effect of a misstatement on the current year balance sheet as well as the impact upon the current year income statement in assessing the materiality of a current year misstatement. Once a current year misstatement has been quantified the guidance in SAB Topic 1M, Financial Statements  Materiality (SAB 99) should be applied to determine whether the misstatement is material. The application of SAB 108 did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as reconciled to U.S. GAAP. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-retirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement or financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions, that requirement being effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The pronouncement does not require prior periods to be restated to reflect the impact of SFAS 158. We adopted SFAS 158 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The related disclosures can be found in Note 38 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In February, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statements No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159), which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Under SFAS 159, entities that elect the fair value option (by instrument) will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option election is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. SFAS 159 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entitys election on its earnings, but does not eliminate 52 Table of Contents disclosure requirements of other accounting standards. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value must be displayed on the face of the balance sheet. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS 159 will have on our financial position or results of operations. Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements. Segment Reporting The objective of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information is to provide users of financial statements information about the different types of business segments in which a company engages and the different economic environments in which it operates. Our management has structured our operations into five business segments that we utilize as reporting segments. These sectors are our Offshore SURF segment, Offshore Facilities segment, the Onshore-Downstream segment, (which includes our hydrocarbons activities), our Industries segment, (which include our non-hydrocarbon businesses) and our Corporate segment. In 2004, we had only three segments: Offshore, Onshore-Downstream and Industries. Within our Offshore segment, we reported revenues and operating income for our Offshore SURF and Offshore Facilities segments. In 2005, we decided to categorize our Offshore SURF and Offshore Facilities segments as two separate segments to reflect our internal reporting. Without this split, Offshore segment revenues would have represented more than 50% of the Groups revenues for 2005. For convenience, 2004 figures have been recalculated accordingly to allow for a comparison between 2004 and 2005. In 2004, we categorized revenues by geographic region, which included an Africa and Middle-East region. In order to reflect the increasing weights of Africa and the Middle-East in our operations, our internal reporting has been organized consequently by distinguishing these two geographical regions separately. This region has therefore been split into two zones: Africa and Middle East. For convenience, 2004 figures have been set out to allow comparison between 2004 and 2005. Foreign Currency We operate under long-term contracts that are frequently denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the Euro. As of December 31, 2006, revenues from contracts denominated in non-Euro currencies were approximately 66.3% of our total revenues, of which 40.8% were denominated in U.S. Dollars. Approximately 29.2% of our operating expenses during this period were denominated in U.S. Dollars and significant amounts were also denominated in Japanese yen, British Pound Sterling, Malaysian Ringitt, Brazilian Real, Australian Dollar, Indian Rupee, Norwegian Crown and Canadian Dollar. For a detailed description of our exposure to foreign currencies and currency hedging instruments, see Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our policy is to naturally hedge a substantial portion of our contracts by matching the currency in which we will ourselves receive payment to the currency of our own equipment purchases and subcontractor payments. Subsequently, we manage our foreign currency exposure on the portion of anticipated foreign currency cash flows that is not naturally hedged by entering into standard financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts or options. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. During the bid period, our currency exposure derives from the fact that exchange rate movements between the date as of which we calculate our projected costs and resulting bid and the date on which the contract is awarded could negatively affect our expected margins. We manage our currency risk exposure, primarily, by submitting multicurrency bids matched to the expected currencies of expenses and secondarily, to the extent necessary, by hedging or insurance contracts and, to a limited extent, options. Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements describes the accounting principles related to foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency transactions are translated into Euro at the rate of exchange applicable at the transaction date, except for those related to long-term contracts, which are translated using the 53 Table of Contents contract rate based on foreign currency hedging. At year end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euros at the exchange rate prevailing at that date except for contracts-in-progress accounts and progress payments received from long-term contract customers, which are recorded at the contract rate. The resulting exchange gains or losses are recorded in the income statement. Outlook for 2007 After having stabilized our backlog in 2006, our target for the full year 2007 is to manage its growth by focusing on the most attractive projects. We anticipate moderate revenue growth and further operating income improvement. Recent Developments In January 2007, we sold our 20% interest in Nargan, an Iranian engineering company, to another Nargan shareholder. In February 2007, we sold our entire interest in the share capital of PSS Ltd. and PSS Inc., two companies that produce remote-controlled underwater robots and other underwater machinery. Based in Kirkbymoorside (United Kingdom) and Jupiter (Florida, United States), these companies employ approximately 300 employees and generated revenues of 70 million over 2006, primarily with clients outside of our Group. Their assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale in the 2006 balance sheet. At the annual shareholders meeting held on April 27, 2007, shareholders approved the resolution to pay a dividend of 3.15 per ordinary share or ADS. On May 15, 2007, we announced the following unaudited IFRS results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2007 as compared to first quarter 2006:  1.481 billion in order intake for the period ended March 31, 2007, against 1.825 billion recorded for the period ended March 31, 2006;  1.775 billion in revenues, an increase of 12.7% compared to the first quarter of 2006 where we recorded 1.574 billion in revenues;  107.9 million in operating income, excluding income from the disposition of activities, an increase of 237.2% compared to 32 million during the first quarter of 2006;  net income of 68.1 million, a 169.2% improvement over the 25.3 million recorded in the first quarter of 2006;  diluted earnings per share of 0.65 per share, an improvement of 109.7% compared to the 0.31 per share recorded in the first quarter of 2006;  diluted earnings per ADS of U.S.$0.87 per share, a 103.1% increase from the U.S.$0.43 per ADS recorded in the first quarter of 2007. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 under IFRS Revenues In 2006, we had consolidated revenues of 6.926 billion, an increase of 28.8% from revenues of 5.376 billion in 2005. Our revenues are largely comprised by revenues of our three largest business segments, our Onshore-Downstream segment, our Offshore SURF segment and our Offshore Facilities segment. 48% of our revenues came from our Onshore-Downstream segment in 2006 against 43% the previous year. Qatargas2, Freeport LNG and Nigeria train VI contracts were the main contributors of the segment. In 2006 and 2005, our Offshore SURF share is flat with 32% and 33% of revenues and our Offshore Facilities segment accounted for 17% of revenues, compared to 19%, in 2005. 54 Table of Contents The five following projects have produced revenues of 1.476 billion, i.e., 21.3% of the Groups revenues: Dalia UFL, AKPO FPSO, Qatargas2, Qatargas 3&4, and Rasgas 3. According to IFRS, joint ventures are consolidated under the proportional method. See Note 31 (Joint Ventures) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Only two contracts for a total amount of revenues of 44 million did not recognize any margin in 2006. If we recalculate 2006 revenues using 2005 exchange rates, there would be an increase in revenues of 5.8 million, and an impact on the operating margin of 3.4 million. Backlog. We define backlog as the remaining portion of ongoing contracts sale price recognized in the future. Our backlog has been stabilized at a high level, 10.273 billion as of December 31, 2006, compared to 11.170 billion one year earlier. Geographically, 48% was located in the Middle East region, 13% in Africa, 18% in the Americas, 12% in Asia-Pacific and 9% in Europe, Russia, Central Asia. By business segment, as of December 31, 2006, 26% of our backlog was for Offshore SURF, 7% for Offshore Facilities, 65% for Onshore-Downstream and 2% for Industries. Backlog for our Onshore-Downstream segment amounted to 6.650 billion, representing 65% of the total backlog. Within our Onshore-Downstream segment, 76% of backlog was driven by projects in the Middle East-Africa region with contracts, such as the LNG trains of Qatargas II 3 and 4 in Qatar, Nigeria train VI in Nigeria and the Yemen LNG in Yemen, the ethylene of Yanbu in Saudi Arabia, Ras Laffan in Qatar and Pic-Dow in Kuwait. In addition, the Group has a contract for the Al Jubail refinery, which is relatively small in terms of backlog but very material in terms of workload. In the Asia-Pacific region, the backlog is mainly driven by the Dung Quat refinery in Vietnam and the ethylene ovens in Thailand. In Europe, Russia, Central Asia, the main contracts are PKN Paroxylen and PKN Hydrogen (Poland), Refinery Venice Revamp (Italy) and Prime G Donges (France). In the Americas region, the backlog is driven by the two CNRL contracts in Canada, the LNG terminal in Freeport (Texas), which came in force in 2004 and 2005, and other service contracts based on hydrogen technology in North America and the refinery extension in Colombia. The backlog of our Offshore SURF segment was 2.719 billion as of December 31, 2006, relatively stable. 35% of SURF backlog was located in Africa (955 million) with various projects like AGBAMI in Nigeria, DALIA UFL, Block 18, Mondo and Gimboa in Angola. 35% of SURF backlog was driven by projects in the Americas, especially in Brazil. As of December 31, 2006, 741.6 million related to our Offshore Facilities segment, a decrease of 465.1 million. 41% of the backlog of Offshore Facilities was driven in the Americas with two projects, Perdido and Tahiti, located in the Gulf of Mexico, and two others located in Brazil. Backlog for our Industries segment amounted to 161.9 million compared to 148.0 million as of December 31, 2005. Within our Industries segment, backlog consisted principally of several service and construction contracts for the pharmaceutical, chemical, power, metal, cement, aero-space and industrial space industries. Revenues by Segment Offshore SURF. Our Offshore SURF segment accounted for 2.209 billion, or 31.9% of total revenues in 2006 compared to 1.798 billion, or 33.4% in 2005. In 2006, the main projects were Dalia UFL (Total) and Block 18 Greater Plutonio (BP) in Angola and Agbami (CHEVRON TEXACO) in Nigeria for the Africa region; Bidao and PDET (Petrobras) in Brazil for the Americas; Fram Ost and Vilje (Norsk Hydro) and Alvheim (Marathon) in the Norwegian sector of the North-Sea; Brenda (OILEXCO) and Maria (BG) in the British sector. Offshore Facilities. Our Offshore Facilities segment accounted for 1.195 billion, or 17.3% of total revenues in 2006 compared to 1.013 billion, or 18.9% in 2005. In 2006, the main contracts were Dalia FPSO (Total) in Angola, Akpo FPSO (Total), Amenam Phase 2 (Total) and East Area (ExxonMobil) in Nigeria for Africa; Kikeh DTU (Murphy Oil) in Malaysia for the Asia-Pacific region; Tahiti (Chevron Texaco) and Perdido (SHELL) in the 55 Table of Contents Gulf of Mexico and P51 / P52 (Petrobras) in Brazil for Americas; Shah Deniz (BP) in Azerbaijan and Qatar Gas II Offshore for the Middle-East region. Onshore-Downstream. Our Onshore-Downstream segment accounted for 3.318 billion, or 47.9% of total revenues in 2006, compared to 2.318 billion or 43.1% in 2005. It represents the highest growth in a segment in 2006. The major contributors came from contracts obtained in 2004 and which have reached a completion rate of higher than 50%: Qatargas 2, Freeport LNG and Nigeria train VI. It also resulted, in large part, from contracts obtained in 2005: CNRL HOSP, Sabic Yanbu, Ras Laffan Ethylen, Dung Quat, Rasgas3, Yemen LNG. The contribution of contracts that recently entered into force mainly related to LNG contracts: Qatargas 3 and 4 and AKG2. Industries. The Industries segment accounted for revenues of 204.0 million, or 2.9% of total revenues in 2006, as compared to 246.9 million, or 4.6% of total net revenues in 2005. Revenues in 2006 derived from contracts in the pharmaceutical industry (Genzyme Thymoglobulin, Sanofi projects), the chemical industry (Diester units in Compiègne and Montoir in France, TOTAL Petrochemicals Chicago, Oxychem) and several contracts in the cement and metals industries. Revenues by Geographic Area Europe, Russia, Central Asia. During 2006, our operations in Europe, Russia, Central Asia generated 1.399 billion in revenues, or 20.2% of total revenues, compared to 1.383 billion in revenues or 25.7% of total revenues in 2005. The principal contributors to revenues in this region in 2006 were in our Offshore SURF segment: Brenda and Maria in the British sector of the North-Sea and Alvheim (Marathon) and Fram Ost and Vilje in the Norwegian sector. The Shah Deniz contract (BP) in Azerbaijan was the main contributor of our Offshore Facilities segment in this region. Additionally, revenues recorded from our Onshore-Downstream segment in this region included Gonfreville (Total France). Finally, the Industries segment in this region mainly related to the project Termoli (Energia) in Italy. Africa. Revenues generated from our activities in Africa during 2006 amounted to 1.254 billion or 18.1% of total revenues, compared to 1.258 billion or 23.4% of total 2005 revenues. Revenues in Africa remain flat despite its decrease as a percentage of total revenues. This decrease results from the large increase of Middle-East revenues. The main contributors in Offshore SURF segment were Dalia UFL (Total), Block 18 Plutonio and Mondo in Angola and Agbami in Nigeria. The principal Offshore Facilities contracts contributing to revenues in this region in 2006 were Akpo FPSO (Total), East Area (ExxonMobil), Amenam Phase 2 (Total) in Nigeria and Dalia FPSO (Total) in Angola. Our Onshore-Downstream segment in this area represented 148.8 million or 12% of total revenues compared to 9% last year. Our principal Onshore-Downstream contracts in this region were Nigeria Trains IV and V, which were completed in 2006. Nigeria train VI will be completed in 2007. Middle East. Revenues generated from our activities in Middle East during 2006 amounted to 2.071 billion or 29.9% of total revenues, compared to 1.108 billion or 20.6% of total 2005 revenues. Our Onshore-Downstream segment in this region represented 1.957 billion or 94.5% of total revenues in 2006 compared to 95% in 2005. Our principal Onshore-Downstream contracts in this area were in the LNG field in Qatar: Qatargas2, Rasgas3, Qatargas 3 &4, AKG2 (signed in 2004, 2005 and 2006 with Chiyoda as partner). We also had major ethylene contracts, such as Sabic Yanbu in Saudi Arabia, Pic Dow in Kuwait and Ras Laffan in Qatar. Furthermore, Technip executes a contract for the gas treatment unit of Khursanyah in Saudi Arabia even if its contribution to revenues is weak because it is a service contract on a reimbursable basis. Asia-Pacific. Our operations in the Asia-Pacific region generated revenues of 806.7 million, or 11.6% of 2006 total revenues compared to 583.4 million in 2005. The principal contributors to our Offshore SURF segment are Stybarrow (BHPP) and Enfield in Australia and Pohokura in New Zealand. The main Onshore contracts in this region in 2006 were the Dung Quat refinery plant contract signed in joint venture with JGC and Tecnicas Reunidas in 2005, which was at approximately 50% of completion at the end of 2006. In addition, we have carried out two polyethylene plants in China, a furnace ethylene project in Korea and the Otway project in Australia. Americas. Revenues generated from our activities in the Americas represented 1.395 billion or 20.1% of 2006 revenues, compared to 1.043 billion in 2005, or 19.4% of total revenues in 2005. The main contributor of the 56 Table of Contents region is the Onshore-Downstream segment with two contracts in Canada, (a hydrogen plant and a heavy oil separation unit), and a contract for a receiving terminal in Texas called Freeport LNG, signed in partnership in 2004. The percentage of completion of this project was nearly 70% at the end of 2006. Revenues in this region are particularly tied to Offshore operations in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico including both the SURF and Facilities segments: Bidao and PDET contracts in Brazil and NCMA in Trinidad & Tobago for the SURF segment, and Tahiti (Texaco Chevron), Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico and P51 and P52 (PETROBRAS) in Brazil for the Facilities segment. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales was 6.202 billion in 2006, compared to 4.818 billion in 2005. However, the gross margin rate remained stable between 2005 and 2006: 10.5% against 10.4% the previous year. The main components are payroll, engineering costs and external costs, such as procurement costs or construction costs. Our Onshore-Downstream, Offshore SURF and Offshore Facilities segments each accounted for about 50.4%, or 3.129 billion, 29.6%, or 1.836 billion and 17.1%, or 1.062 billion, of our cost of sales, respectively. The nature of the costs is quite different from one segment to another. The SURF and Facilities segments have an activity in flexible piping and construction which need industrial assets (plants, yards, pipe-lay vessels, spoolbase) and these segments require a less costly workforce than the one required in the Onshore-Downstream segment. The Onshore-Downstream segment requires a highly skilled workforce (engineers) and requires no industrial assets. Its external costs consist of procurement and subcontracting construction work, while the SURF segment itself, thanks to its vessels, builds, ships and repairs some of its required equipment. In the Onshore-Downstream segment, procurement costs increased in 2006. Research and Development Expenses Research and Development expenses showed a slight increase in 2006 at 34.9 million compared to 29.4 million in 2005. No expenses were capitalized in 2006 or 2005. Selling and Administrative Costs Our selling and administrative costs during 2006 were 354.4 million (or 5.1% of revenues) compared to 308.2 million (or 5.7% of revenues) incurred in 2005. This slight decrease in the percentage came from the Groups decision to be more selective in its bidding policy. Other Operating Income and Expenses In 2006 and 2005, other operating income and expenses resulted mainly from gains on the sale of assets: 25 million gain in 2006 and 10.5 million in 2005. A breakdown of Other Operating Income and Expenses is provided in Note 4C and D to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The variation results from the net sales on assets, which varies from year to year according to the assets we sell. Income/(Loss) from Operations The primary operating performance measure for our business segments is income/(loss) from operations which we disclose on the face of our consolidated statement of operations included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that income/(loss) from operations is useful to investors and management to demonstrate the operational profitability of our segments by excluding interest and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis. Our income from operations amounted to 360.1 million in 2006 compared to 231.0 million in 2005. Income/(Loss) from Operations by Segment (operating margin). Below we present operating income margin by business segment for 2006 and 2005. We have defined segment operating income margin as segment income from operations divided by segment net revenues. 57 Table of Contents Our Offshore SURF segment generated income from operations of 213.5 million (or 9.7% of net revenues) compared to 118.8 million (or 6.6% of revenues) in 2005. In 2005, the SURF segment was penalized by a non-recurring charge. In 2006, the utilization rate of vessels and plants was excellent. Our Offshore Facilities segment generated income from operations of 83.8 million (or 7.0% of revenues) compared to 27.1 million (or 2.7% of revenues) in 2005. Excluding income from GMF asset dispositions, the operating margin ratio amounted to 5.2% in 2006. Our Onshore-Downstream segment generated income from operations of 73.8 million (or 2.2% of revenues) compared to 88.3 million (or 3.8% of revenues) in 2005. This decrease is explained by the fact that most of the contracts in this segment are recent, as a result of which, we do recognize revenues but a reduced margin at the beginning of the contract in accordance with our Groups accounting principles. Our Industries segment generated income from operations of 11.3 million (or 5.5% of revenues), compared to 6.0 million in 2005 or 2.4% of revenues. This increase confirms the improvement of the profitability of the segment as a result of the termination of U.S. pharmaceutical activities in July 2005. Our Corporate activities generated a loss from operations of (22.3) million, compared to a (9.2) million loss in 2005. This loss results mainly from a non-recurring item: 14.9 million spent for the implementation of procedures to be compliant with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provisions. Income/(Loss) from Operations by Geographic Region. Below we present income/(loss) from operations and operating margins ratios for 2006 and 2005. We have defined operating margins ratios as income from operations divided by segment revenues for a given zone. 2006 2005 (in millions of Euros) Income/(Loss) from Operations by Geographic Region  Europe, Russia, Central Asia 151.1 162.2  Africa 60.3 (42.5 )  Middle East 125.0 50.5  Asia-Pacific (80.9 ) 27.2  Americas 104.6 33.6 Total 360.1 231.0 Operating Margin Ratios by Geographic Region (in %)  Europe, Russia, Central Asia 10.8 11.7  Africa 4.8 (3.4 )  Middle East 6.0 4.6  Asia-Pacific (10.0 ) 4.7  Americas 7.5 3.2 In Europe, Russia, Central Asia, we generated income from operations of 151.1 million in 2006 (10.8% operating margin ratio) compared to 162.2 million (11.7%) in 2005. The SURF segment has performed well in the North Sea region. The Onshore-Downstream segment contribution comes mainly from the HDT projects in Turkmenistan and several contracts performed in the Netherlands and in Poland. In Africa, we generated income from operations of 60.3 million in 2006 (4.8% operating margin ratio) compared to a loss of 42.5 million in 2005 (-3.4% operating margin ratio). The Onshore-Downstream segment contribution to the income from operations of the region reflects in large part the contracts executed in Nigeria. In 2005, the African operating margins were impacted by the execution of a subsea pipeline contract (SURF Segment) which led to substantial cost overruns. In the Middle East, we generated income from operations of 125.0 million in 2006 (6.0% of operating margin ratio) compared to 50.5 million in 2005 (4.6% operating margin ratio). The Onshore-Downstream segment contribution to the income from operations of the region reflects the contracts executed in Yemen, Qatar, Saudi 58 Table of Contents Arabia, Oman and Kuwait. The good contribution of the Offshore Facilities in 2005 was mainly due to reversals of provisions on completed contracts (Soroosh Noroosh and Al Rayan). In Asia-Pacific, we generated a loss from operations of (80.9) million in 2006 ((10.0)% operating margin ratio) compared to an income of 27.2 million in 2005 (4.7% operating margin ratio). The loss came from Offshore Facilities and Onshore-Downstream segments. Provisions were consistently recorded on almost-completed contracts in Australia to offset the lack of productivity of the hired staff. With this exception, other projects are running correctly, in particular, the Dung Quat refinery plant project is progressing on schedule. Nevertheless, its low percentage of completion at the end of 2006 has not enabled us to show high margins. In the Americas, we generated income from operations of 104.6 million in 2006 (7.5% operating margin ratio) compared to 33.6 million in 2005 (3.2% operating margin ratio). For the SURF segment, the income from operations reflects an increasing activity in the Gulf of Mexico and in Brazil, successful completion of installation for numerous projects and contracts such as PDET and Bidao in Brazil which offsets the decreasing activity in Canada due to the completion of Husky White Rose in 2005. Financial Result We had a net financial loss of 61.5 million in 2006 compared to a loss of 88.8 million in 2005. The 2006 improvement came from the conversion of the convertible bonds in March 2006. The bonds had impacted the net financial loss by 38.0 million in 2005 and by only 10.0 million in 2006. Financial result does not include financial revenue on positive cash balances of individual contracts, which we account for as revenue. In 2006 and 2005, financial revenues on contracts contributed to 78.7 million and to 31.4 million, respectively, of the Groups revenues. Share of Income/(Loss) of Associates Accounted for Using the Equity Method We had income from equity affiliates of (2.6) million in 2006, compared to 1.3 million in 2005, essentially derived from Nargan and KTI SpA. Income Tax Expense Our income tax expense for 2006 amounted to 94.1 million, for an income before tax of 296.0 million, compared to income tax of 43.5 million in 2005 (Income before continued and discontinued operations). Compared to the generally applicable French corporate income tax rate of 34.43%, our effective income tax rate amounted to 29.55% in 2006 and 31.41% in 2005. This slight decrease comes from differed tax assets booked in 2006 and not recognized earlier as margin expectations for subsidiaries were uncertain before. Minority Interests Minority interests in our earnings amounted to (1.8) million in 2006, compared to (1.7) million in 2005. Net Income/(Loss) The net consolidated income attributable to shareholders of the parent company for 2006 was 200.1 million, compared to 93.3 million in 2005. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2005, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 under IFRS Revenues In 2005, we had consolidated revenues of 5.376 billion, an increase of 4.6% from 5.141 billion in 2004. Our revenues are largely comprised by revenues from our three largest segments, our Onshore-Downstream segment, our SURF segment and our Offshore Facilities segment. In our Onshore-Downstream segment in 2005, among the largest contributors to revenues, due to the size and status of progress on these contracts, were Oryx GTL (Qatar), Gonfreville (France), NEB (Abu Dhabi), HDT (Saudi Arabia), Nigeria Trains IV and V, Takreer (Abu Dhabi) and 59 Table of Contents Otway (Australia). In 2005, our SURF segment accounted for 33% of revenues and our Offshore Facilities segment accounted for 19% of revenues, compared to 28% and 21%, respectively, in 2004. Backlog. We define backlog as the remaining portion of ongoing contracts sale price recognized in the future. Our backlog was 11.169 billion as of December 31, 2005 compared to 6.779 billion as of December 31, 2004. Geographically, 46% was in the Middle East region, 18% in Africa, 19% in the Americas, 9% in Asia-Pacific and 8% in Europe, Russia, Central Asia.

In 2005, 1.207 billion related to our Offshore Facilities segment, an increase of 944.4 million in 2004. In 2005, 47% of the backlog of Offshore SURF was driven in Africa by projects as Agbami (Chevron Texaco) in Nigeria, Dalia UFL (Total) and Block 18 (BP) in Angola. In the Offshore Facilities segment, the Africa region accounted for 44% of the backlog with contracts as Akpo FPSO (Chevron Texaco), East Area (ExxonMobil) and Amenam Phase 2 (Total) in Nigeria, and Dalia FPSO (Total) in Angola. Backlog for our Onshore-Downstream segment amounted to 7.127 billion, increasing from 3.758 billion, or 89.6% compared to December 31, 2004. Within our Onshore-Downstream segment, 70% of backlog was driven by projects in the Middle East region with contracts as the LNG trains of Rasgas III and Qatargas II in Qatar and the one in Yemen, the ethylene of Yanbu in Saudi Arabia, Ras Laffan in Qatar, Pic-Dow in Kuwait and Kharg in Iran. In the Asia-Pacific, the backlog is mainly driven by the Dung Quat refinery in Vietnam and the Otway gas treatment unit (Woodside) in Australia in force in 2004. In Europe, Russia, Central Asia, the main contracts are Train VI of LNG in Nigeria and Gonfreville Total (France). In America, the backlog is driven by the two CNRL contracts in Canada, the LNG terminal in Freeport (Texas), which came in force in 2004, Valero Hydrogen in the United States and Hovensa in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Backlog for our Industries segment amounted to 148.0 million compared to 216.3 million as of December 31, 2004.

Income/(Loss) from Operations The primary operating performance measure for our business segments is income/(loss) from operations which we disclose on the face of our consolidated statement of operations included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that income/(loss) from operations is useful to investors and management to demonstrate the operational profitability of our segments by excluding interest and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis. Our income from operations amounted to 231.0 million in 2005 compared to 233.6 million in 2004. Income/(Loss) from Operations by Segment (operating margin). Below we present operating margin ratio by business segment for 2005 and 2004. We have defined segment operating income margin as segment income from operations divided by segment revenues. Our Offshore SURF segment generated income from operations of 118.8 million (or 6.6% of revenues) compared to 146.5 million (or 10.3% of revenues) in 2004. Our Offshore Facilities segment generated income from operations of 27.1 million (or 2.7% of revenues) compared to 17.5 million (or 1.6% of revenues) in 2004. Our Onshore-Downstream segment generated income from operations of 88.3 million (or 3.8% of revenues) compared to 92.1 million (or 3.9% of revenues) in 2004. Our Industries segment generated income from operations of 6.0 million (or 2.4% of revenues), compared to a loss of 7.1 million in 2004 or -2.6% of revenues. During the year 2004, Industries segment income from operations suffered from costs linked to start-up of Technip Biopharm in the United States and a difficult contract in the Middle East. Our Corporate activities generated a loss from operations of (9.2) million, including (5.4) million of stock option charge. Income/(Loss) from Operations by Geographic Region. Below we present income / (loss) from operations and operating margin ratios for 2005 and 2004. We have defined operating margins as income from operations divided by segment revenues for a given zone. 2005 2004 in millions of Euros Income/(Loss) from Operations by Geographic Region  Europe, Russia, Central Asia 162.2 84.5  Africa (42.5 ) 79.3  Middle East 50.5 17.9  Asia-Pacific 27.2 38.8  Americas 33.6 13.1 Total 231.0 233.6 Operating margin ratios (in %)  Europe, Russia, Central Asia 11.7 6.6  Africa (3.4 ) 6.2  Middle East 4.6 1.4  Asia-Pacific 4.7 10.2  Americas 3.2 1.4 In Europe, Russia, Central Asia, we generated income from operations of 162.2 million in 2005 (11.7% operating margin ratio) compared to 84.5 million (6.6%) in 2004. The Offshore SURF segment has performed well 62 Table of Contents in the North Sea region. The Onshore-Downstream segment contribution comes from the projects MOH Refinery in Greece, HDT in Turkmenistan and several contracts performed in Spain and France in Gonfreville and Lavera. In Africa, we generated a loss from operations of 42.5 million in 2005 (-3.4% of operating margin ratio) compared to income of 79.3 million in 2004 (6.2% operating margin ratio). The Onshore-Downstream segment contribution to the income from operations of the region reflects in large part the contracts executed in Nigeria and South Africa. The Offshore SURF operating margins were impacted by the execution of a subsea pipeline contract which led to substantial cost overruns. In the Middle East, we generated income from operations of 50.5 million in 2005 (4.6% of operating margin ratio) compared to 17.9 million in 2004 (1.4% operating margin ratio). The Onshore-Downstream segment contribution to the income from operations of the region reflects the contracts executed in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Oman and Abu Dhabi. The increasing contribution of the Offshore Facilities was mainly due to growing activity in the region and to reversals of provisions on contracts completed (Soroosh Noroosh and Al Rayan). In Asia-Pacific, we generated income from operations of 27.2 million in 2005 (4.7% operating margin ratio) compared to 38.8 million in 2004 (10.2% operating margin ratio). For the Onshore-Downstream segment, the situation in this region reflects in large part to BP SECCO in China, Otway in Australia and the starting-up of Dung Quat in Vietnam. In the Americas, we generated income from operations of 33.6 million in 2005 (3.2% operating income margin) compared to 13.1 million in 2004 (1.4% operating income margin). For the Offshore SURF segment, the income from operations reflects an increasing activity in the Gulf of Mexico and in Brazil, successful completion of installation for numerous projects and contracts such as Husky White Rose in Canada and Bidao in Brazil. Financial Result We had a net financial loss of 88.8 million in 2005 compared to 66.4 million in 2004. This line item does not include financial revenue on positive cash balances of individual contracts, which we account as revenues. In 2005 and 2004, financial revenues from these sources contributed 31.4 million and 9.9 million respectively. Share of Income/(Loss) of Associates Accounted for Using the Equity Method We had income from equity affiliates of 1.3 million in 2005,(compared to 1.2 million in 2004), which was essentially derived from Nargan. Income Tax Expense Our income tax expense for 2005 amounted to 43.5 million, for income before tax and after income/(loss) from discontinued operations of 138.5 million, compared to income tax of 54.2 million in 2004. Compared to the generally applicable French corporate income tax rate of 34.93%, our effective income tax rate amounted to 31.41% in 2005 and 32.19% in 2004. Deferred income taxes are recognized in accordance with IAS 12, using the liability method (use of the last forecast tax rate voted at the closing date), on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for each of the Groups companies. Deferred income taxes are reviewed at each balance sheet date to take into account any effect of changes in tax law and in the prospects of recovery. Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements describes our income tax expense, our deferred income tax, our tax loss carry-forwards and our tax credits. Minority Interests Minority interests in our earnings amounted to (1.7) million in 2005, compared to (2.4) million in 2004. 63 Table of Contents Net Income/(Loss) The net consolidated income attributable to shareholders of the parent company for 2005 was 93.3 million, compared to 111.8 million in 2004. Cash Flows 2006 compared to 2005 Cash and cash equivalents increased by 215.0 million in 2006 to 2.403 billion at December 31, 2006. This increase is mainly due to the cash provided by operating activities (352.6 million) and the changes in working capital (594.2 million), offset by the treasury shares and the paid dividends. Cash from Operating Activities Cash flow from operations aside from working capital, amounted to 352.6 million, compared to 275.8 million in 2005. In 2006, amortization and depreciation of tangible and intangible assets showed a slight increase, amounting to 159.8 million, compared to 143.3 million in 2005. Non-cash OCEANE charges amounted to 10.0 million in 2006 against 29.9 million in 2005. This decrease results from the early conversion of the OCEANE bonds in March 2006. The change in working capital maintained its high level at 594.2 million in 2006 against 618.1 million in 2005. Cash provided (used) by Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities was 119.9 million in 2006 against 144.6 million in 2005. The capital expenditures amounted to 157.2 million in 2006 compared to 170.5 million in 2005. We decided to develop our industrial assets by increasing our number of ships and the capacity of our flexible pipe manufacturing facilities. This policy will be pursued in 2007 and 2008. Proceeds from the sale of assets amounted 40.4 million in 2006 compared to 22.0 million in 2005. The net gain on sale of assets, amounting to 25.3 million was mainly due to the sale of Gulf Marine Fabricators assets and a building located in France (Lyon). The cash received from the sale of GMF assets amounted to 76.3 million and 2.3 million for the building in Lyon. Cash provided (used) by Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities amounted to 485.7 million in 2006 compared to 78.4 million in 2005. The main changes came from the acquisition of our own shares (367.9 million in 2006) which were partly used for the conversion of OCEANE bonds into shares and partly for a reduction of the share capital by 248.4 million. Dividends paid were higher: 32 million were paid in 2005 to complete the dividend paid in advance 2004; 101.7 million were paid in 2006, of which 90.9 million for the 2005 dividend and an advance payment on the 2006 dividend of 52.4 million. 2005 compared to 2004 Cash and cash equivalents increased by 753.8 million in 2005 to 2.187 billion at December 31, 2005. This improvement is mainly due to the cash provided by operating activities, in particular, the changes in working capital. Cash flow from operating activities. We recorded positive cash flow from operating activities of 893.9 million in 2005 compared to positive cash flow from operating activities in 2004 of 397.8 million. Cash flow from operations amounted to 275.8 million compared to 307.9 million in 2004. In 2005, amortization and depreciation of tangible and intangible assets totaled 143.3 million, compared to 142.1 million in 2004. Cash flows from operating activities deducts income of equity affiliates (net of dividends) from net income, 64 Table of Contents which was (0.6) million in 2005 compared to (1.2) million in 2004. Cash flows from operating activities also adds back gains or losses on the disposition of fixed and financial assets, which was a gain of 10.4 million in 2005 compared to a loss of 9.2 million in 2004. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities had a positive impact of 618.1 million compared to 89.9 million in 2004 on the Groups cash. Non-cash charges on the convertible bond (OCEANE) amounted to 16.6 million in 2005 according the IAS 32-39 set in force in 2005. Cash flow from investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was 144.6 million in 2005 compared to 128.3 million in 2004. Total capital expenditures on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, were 170.5 million in 2005, compared to 123.8 million in 2004. Proceeds from the disposition of fixed assets and investments amounted to 22.0 million in 2005 compared to 22.9 million in 2004. The cash increase of 4.8 million in 2005 compared to a decrease of 27.4 million in 2004 from changes in scope of consolidation represents the cash balances of companies acquired or disposed, measured as of the date of acquisition or disposition. In 2005, this amount related to the treasury linked to the entries of Technip South Africa for 2.4 million and Technipetrol Hellas for 3.2 million. Cash flow from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled 78.4 million in 2005 compared to net cash generated of 304.8 million in 2004. This variation related primarily to the issue of a bond loan in May 2004 for an amount of 650.0 million. Other financing activities using cash in 2005 were our payment of a dividend amounting to 32.0 million, the decrease in borrowings for 90.1 million, the capital increase for 63.8 million and 20.1 million in our treasury share buy-backs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our main needs for capital are the funding of ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. We have financed our needs with cash flow from operations, borrowings under bank facilities and our offerings of senior notes. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities, the additional financial resources generated by the issuance of our senior notes and available borrowing under bank facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We estimate that capital expenditures for our 2007 fiscal year will be approximately 351 million. Our budgeted investments will be devoted to the fleet in an amount of 169 million, mainly for the construction of two new vessels and the extension of our manufacturing facilities in Brazil and in France for a total amount of 57 million. Capital expenditures amounted to 157.2 million in 2006, compared to 170.5 million in 2005 and a 2006 budget of 234 million. Capital expenditures were below budget due to some slippage in 2006. For each construction contract, the accumulated costs incurred, as well as the gross margin recognized at the contracts percentage of completion (plus accruals for foreseeable losses if needed), after deducting the progress payments invoiced to the client, are shown on the asset side under the Construction Contracts  Amounts Due from Clients if the balance of those combined components is a debit; if the balance is a credit, these are shown on the liability side under the Construction Contracts  Amounts Due to Clients line item. Construction Contracts  Amounts Due from Clients increased to 591.1 million as of December 31, 2006, compared to 585.0 million as of December 31, 2005. Construction Contracts  Amounts Due to Clients increased from 33.1 million in 2004 to 35.5 million in 2005 and 44.7 million in 2006. Progress payments made by clients related to unrealized works are recognized under the Advances Received liability item. Advances received amounted to 2.094 billion as of December 31, 2006, compared to 1.637 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 915.6 million as of December 31, 2004. Our inventories as of December 31, 2006 amounted to 134.4 million, compared to 101.0 million and 87.2 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Inventories reflect principally the flexible piping and other manufacturing activities of our SURF and Offshore Facilities segments. 65 Table of Contents Shareholders equity (Group part) as of December 31, 2006, before distribution of dividends related to the profit for the year, was 2.401 billion, compared to 1.954 billion and 1.852 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In total, our management believes that shareholders equity is adequate to finance our fixed assets and provides a sound financial basis for the Group. Our total current and non-current provisions amounted to 197.9 million as of December 31, 2006, compared to 239.7 million and 236.8 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and provide coverage for contract risks, risks associated with litigation, pension costs and general business risks. On February 23, 2006, we announced the early redemption of all outstanding convertible/exchangeable bonds issued in January 2002, which resulted in an increase of the Groups net cash position of approximately 600.0 million. On April 29, 2004, we raised a 850.0 million new bank revolving facility with a five-year facility to replace two of the authorized unused and confirmed credit lines. On 2005, we amended this bank revolving facility with an extended maturity to June 20, 2010 and reduced financial charges. On 2006, we amended this bank revolving facility with an extended maturity to June 20, 2011. In addition, we have negotiated two bank credit facilities (each for a 125 million amount) with expiry dates of May 26, 2010 and June 27, 2010 respectively. We have amended these two bank credit facilities with new expiry dates of May 26, 2011 and June 27, 2011, respectively. On May 19, 2004, we launched the issue of a 650.0 million seven-year Euro bond maturing on May 26, 2011 with a 4.625% interest rate. The bond issue purpose is for general corporate needs with a view to reinforcing the Groups financial structure by taking advantage of the historically low long-term interest rate environment. As of December 31, 2006, the Group had unused and confirmed multicurrency credit lines of approximately 1.133 billion. Approximately 1.100 billion of this amount is available beyond December 31, 2007. At year-end 2006, we had outstanding commercial paper (one to three month maturity) in a principal amount of 150 million under a program registered with the French Central Bank and authorized in a maximum amount of 600 million. We believe that these, together with cash on hand and marketable securities, provide us with adequate operating liquidity. As of December 31, 2006, our non-current assets amounted to 3.356 billion, including property, plant and equipment of 758.4 million, consisting principally of our construction fleet (376.1 million) and property used for office space and production. As of December 31, 2005, our non-current assets amounted to 3.334 billion, including property, plant and equipment of 771.3 million, consisting principally of our construction fleet (386.7 million) and property used for office space and production. As of December 31, 2004, our non-current assets amounted to 3.338 billion, including property, plant and equipment of 736.5 million, consisting mainly of our fleets (408.5 million) and property used for office space and production.
