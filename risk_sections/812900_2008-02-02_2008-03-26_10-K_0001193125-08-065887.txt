Item 1A. Risk Factors The following are certain risk factors that affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, some of which are beyond the Companys control. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. If any of the events described below were to actually occur, the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected and results could differ materially from expected and historical results. 6 A decline in the demand for luxury goods could have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. As a result of the sale of the SDSG businesses the Company has become primarily focused on the luxury retail sector. SFA stores, Off Fifth stores and www.saks.com offer a wide assortment of luxury fashion apparel, shoes, accessories, jewelry, cosmetics and gift items. All of the goods that the Company sells are discretionary items. Consequently, a downturn in the economy or difficult economic conditions may result in fewer customers shopping in the Companys stores or online. In response, the Company may have to increase the duration and/or frequency of promotional events and offer larger discounts in order to attract customers, which would increase expenses and adversely affect results of operations. Poor economic conditions affect consumer spending and may significantly harm the Companys business. The retail industry is continuously subject to domestic and international economic trends. The success of the Companys business depends to a significant extent upon the level of consumer spending. A number of factors affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that the Company offers, including, among other things:  General economic, industry and weather conditions;  High crude oil prices, that affect gasoline and heating oil prices;  The level of consumer debt;  Interest rates;  Tax rates and policies;  War, terrorism and other hostilities; and  Consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Changes in consumer confidence and fluctuations in financial markets can influence cyclical trends, particularly in the luxury sector. Reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced demand for discretionary items and may force the Company to take significant inventory markdowns. Reduced demand may also require increased marketing and promotional expenses. Additionally, a number of the Companys stores are in tourist markets, including the flagship SFA New York store. A downturn in economic conditions or other events such as terrorist activity could impact travel and thus negatively affect the results of operations for stores located within these tourist markets. Increases in transportation and fuel costs, the financial condition of the airline industry and its impact on air travel and sustained recessionary periods in the U.S. and internationally could also unfavorably impact results of the stores located within these tourist markets. The Companys business and results of operations are subject to a broad range of uncertainties arising out of world events. The Companys business and results of operations are subject to uncertainties arising out of world events, especially as these events may affect U.S. tourism. These uncertainties may include a global economic slowdown, changes in consumer spending or travel, an increase in gasoline and commodity prices, epidemics and the economic consequences of natural disasters, military action or terrorist activity (including threats of terrorist activity). Any future events arising as a result of terrorist activity, natural disasters or other world events may have a material impact on the Companys business, its ability to source products, results of operations and financial condition in the future. 7 The Companys business and results of operations may be adversely affected by weather conditions and natural disasters. The Companys business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions. Periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter or unseasonably cold or wet weather in the spring or summer affect consumer apparel purchases and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and floods may adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Companys business is intensely competitive and increased or new competition could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The retail industry is intensely competitive. As a retailer offering a broad selection of luxury fashion apparel, shoes, accessories, jewelry, cosmetics and gift items, the Company currently competes against a diverse group of retailers, including e-commerce retailers, which sell, among other products, products similar to those of the Company. The Company also competes in particular markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of products that the Company sells. Following the sale of the Companys SDSG businesses, the Company has become less diversified and is now reliant on its luxury retail business. A number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition including:  Increased operational efficiencies of competitors;  Competitive pricing strategies, including deep discount pricing by a broad range of retailers during periods of poor consumer confidence or economic instability;  Expansion of product offerings by existing competitors;  Entry by new competitors into markets in which the Company currently operates; and  Adoption by existing competitors of innovative retail sales methods. The Company may not be able to continue to compete successfully with its existing or new competitors, or be assured that prolonged periods of deep discount pricing by its competitors will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. The Company is dependent on its relationships with certain designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise. The Companys relationships with established and emerging designers are a key factor in its position as a retailer of high-fashion merchandise, and a substantial portion of its revenues are attributable to its sales of designer merchandise. Many of the Companys key vendors limit the number of retail channels they use to sell their merchandise and competition among luxury retailers to obtain and sell these goods is intense. The Companys relationships with its designers have been a significant contributor to its past success. The Company has no guaranteed supply arrangements with its principal merchandising sources. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such sources will continue to meet the Companys quality, style and volume requirements. Moreover, nearly all of the top designer brands sold by the Company are also sold by competing retailers, and many of these top designer brands also have their own dedicated retail stores. If one or more of these top designers were to cease providing the Company with adequate supplies of merchandise or, conversely, were to increase sales of merchandise through its own stores or to the stores of other competitors, the Companys business could be adversely affected. In addition, any decline in the popularity or quality of any of these designer brands could adversely affect its business. 8 The Company faces risks associated with consumer preferences and fashion trends. Changes in consumer preferences or consumer interest could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. In addition, fashion trends could materially impact sales. Success in the retail business depends, in part, on the Companys ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Early order commitments often are made far in advance of consumer acceptance. If the Company fails to anticipate accurately and respond to consumer preferences, it could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower profit margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Company faces a number of risks in opening new stores. As part of its growth strategy, the Company could potentially increase the total number of stores, which may include opening new stores in both new and existing markets. The Company may not be able to operate any new stores profitably. Further, new stores may not achieve operating results similar to those of its existing stores. The success of any future store openings will depend upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control, including the following:  The ability of management to adequately analyze and identify suitable markets and individual store sites within those markets;  The ability to attract appropriate vendors;  The competition for suitable store sites;  The ability to negotiate favorable lease terms with landlords;  The availability of employees to staff new stores and the Companys ability to hire, train, motivate and retain store personnel; and  The ability to attract customers and generate sales sufficient to operate new stores profitably. In future years, the Company may enter into additional markets. These markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer trends and discretionary spending patterns than its existing markets, which may cause new stores in these markets to be less successful than stores in existing markets. The loss of, or disruption in, the Companys centralized distribution centers would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and operations. The Company depends on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution centers. Although the Company believes that its receiving and distribution process is efficient, and the Company has appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, hurricanes or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to the Companys stores. Additionally, freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices. Fuel prices affect freight cost both on inbound freight from vendors to the distribution centers and outbound freight from the distribution centers to the Companys stores. Although the Company maintains business interruption and property insurance, management cannot be assured that the Companys insurance coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to the Company, if any of the distribution centers are shut down for any reason. 9 The Company is dependent on external funding sources, which may not make available sufficient funds when the Company needs them. The Company, like other retailers, relies on external funding sources to finance a portion of its operations and growth. Management currently believes that the Companys cash flow from operations and funds available under its revolving credit facility will satisfy its capital requirements for the next 12 months. The Companys ability to obtain additional financing is dependent upon its future operating performance, general economic and competitive conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which the Company cannot control. Loss of the Companys trademarks and service marks or damage to the Companys brand could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations. The Company owns many trademarks and service marks including, but not limited to, Saks Fifth Avenue, SFA, S5A, The Fifth Avenue Club, SAKSFIRST, SFA Signature, SFA Classic, SFA Sport. Off 5th, and Club Libby Lu. Management believes its trademarks and service marks are important and that the loss of certain of its trademarks or trade names, particularly the store nameplates, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Many of the Companys trademarks and service marks are registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, the Company has a well-recognized brand that it believes represents unsurpassed customer service and quality merchandise. Any significant damage to the Companys brand or reputation may negatively impact same-store sales, lower employee morale and productivity, and diminish customer trust, resulting in a reduction in shareholder value. Fluctuations in foreign currency could have an adverse impact on the Companys business. The Company purchases a substantial portion of its inventory from foreign suppliers whose cost to the Company is affected by the fluctuation of their local currency against the dollar or who price their merchandise in currencies other than the dollar. Although fluctuations in the Euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate have the largest impact on the Companys business, it procures goods from many countries and, consequently, is affected by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies of the countries from which the Company purchases goods. Accordingly, changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase the Companys cost of goods sold. If the Company is unable to pass such cost increases on to its customers or the higher cost of the products results in decreased consumption, gross margins, and ultimately earnings, would decrease. A privacy breach could adversely affect the Companys business. The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to the Company. In particular, the Company utilizes customer data captured through the use of proprietary credit cards to develop advertising and promotional events. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across business units. In addition, customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could damage the Companys reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes the Company to possible liabilities and losses. The majority of the SFA stores are owned while all of the Off Fifth and CLL stores are leased. Accordingly, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of the assets could decrease, and their costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition 10 from similar stores in the area, as well as liability for environmental conditions. Store leases generally require the Company to pay a fixed minimum rent and a variable amount based on a percentage of annual sales at that location. The Company generally cannot cancel these leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and the Company decides to close it, the Company may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent for the balance of the applicable lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, the Company may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause the Company to close stores in desirable locations. If an existing owned store is not profitable, and the Company decides to close it, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. In addition, the Company may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause the Company to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location.
