ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Changes in the fair value of the Companys securities may reduce its stockholders equity and net income. At December 31, 2009, $486.06 million of the Companys securities were classified as available-for-sale. At such date, the aggregate unrealized losses on the Companys available-for-sale securities were $27.39 million. The Company increases or decreases stockholders equity by the amount of the change in the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of the Companys available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax benefit, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders equity, as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold and there are no further credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities. In the case of equity securities which have no stated maturity, the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time. The Company conducts periodic reviews and evaluations of its entire securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. Factors which the Company considered in its analysis of debt securities include, but are not limited to, intent to sell the security, evidence available to determine if it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost, and probable credit losses. Probable credit losses are evaluated based upon, but are not limited to: the present value of future cash flows, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the security below its amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions or general market or industry conditions, the payment structure of the security, failure of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, and changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies. The Company generally views changes in fair value for debt securities caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with the Companys experience. If the Company deems such decline to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of non-interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charges of $77.59 million on its debt securities portfolio. Factors that the Company considers in its analysis of equity securities include, but are not limited to: intent to sell the security before recovery of the cost, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the security below its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions or general market or industry conditions. The Company continues to monitor the fair value of its entire securities portfolio as part of its ongoing OTTI evaluation process. No assurance can be given that the Company will not need to recognize OTTI charges related to securities in the future. 12 Table of Contents The current economic environment poses significant challenges for the Company and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. There has been significant disruption and volatility in the financial and capital markets since 2007. The financial markets and the financial services industry in particular suffered unprecedented disruption, causing a number of institutions to fail or require government intervention to avoid failure. These conditions were largely the result of the erosion of the U.S. and global credit markets, including a significant and rapid deterioration in the mortgage lending and related real estate markets. Dramatic declines in the housing markets over the past three years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions. As a consequence, the Company recently experienced losses resulting primarily from substantial impairment charges on investment securities. Continued declines in real estate values, home sales volumes, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Companys borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects on the Company and others in the financial institutions industry. There can be no assurance that the economic conditions that have adversely affected the financial services industry, and the capital, credit and real estate markets generally, will improve significantly, in which case the Company could continue to experience losses, writedowns of assets, further impairment charges of investment securities and capital and liquidity constraints or other business challenges. A further deterioration in local economic conditions, particularly within the Companys geographic regions and markets, could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in its allowance for loan losses. The Company may also face the following risks in connection with these events:  Economic conditions that negatively affect housing prices and the job market have resulted, and may continue to result, in deterioration in credit quality of the Companys loan portfolios, and such deterioration in credit quality has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on the Companys business.  Market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities.  The processes the Company uses to estimate allowance for loan losses and reserves may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation.  The Companys ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches it uses to select, manage, and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future charge-offs.  The Company expects to face increased regulation of its industry, and compliance with such regulation may increase its costs, limit its ability to pursue business opportunities, and increase compliance challenges. As the above conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, the Company could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on its financial condition and results of operations. The Company and its subsidiary business are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect its financial performance. The Companys earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Companys control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Companys ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, and (ii) the fair value of the Companys financial assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Companys net interest income, and therefore 13 Table of Contents earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. The Banks allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. Like all financial institutions, the Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses. The Banks allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the Banks operating results. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Bank to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. The Banks allowance for loan losses is determined by analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan resolution, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, and industry information. Also included in managements estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events, the outcome of which are uncertain. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond the Banks control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the Banks loans and allowance for loan losses. Although the Company believes that the Banks allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable losses, there are no assurances that future increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be needed or that regulators will not require the Bank to increase its allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Companys earnings and profitability. The Company has experienced increases in the levels of non-performing assets and loan charge-offs in recent periods. The Companys total non-performing assets amounted to $22.11 million at December 31, 2009, $14.09 million at December 31, 2008, and $3.47 million at December 31, 2007. The Company had $9.31 million of net loan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $5.45 million and $2.43 million in net loan charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Companys provision for loan losses was $15.05 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $7.42 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, and $717 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2009, the ratios of the Companys allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans and to total loans outstanding was 123.95% and 1.56%, respectively. Additional increases in the Companys non-performing assets or loan charge-offs may require it to increase its allowance for loan losses, which would have an adverse effect upon the Companys future results of operations. The declining real estate market could impact the Companys business. The Companys business activities are conducted in Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and the surrounding region. During 2008 and 2009, the real estate market in these regions experienced declines with falling home prices and increased foreclosures. As the Companys net charge-offs increased during this period and in recognition of the continued deterioration in the real estate market and the potential for further increases in non-performing assets, the Company increased its provision for loan losses during 2008 and 2009. A continued downturn in this regional real estate market could hurt the Companys business because of the geographic concentration within this regional area and because the vast majority of the Companys loans are secured by real estate. If there is a further decline in real estate values, the collateral for the Companys loans will provide less security. As a result, the Companys ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and it will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. The Companys level of credit risk is increasing due to its focus on commercial and construction lending, and the concentration on small businesses and middle market customers with heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. As of December 31, 2009, the Companys largest outstanding commercial business loan and largest outstanding commercial real estate loan amounted to $15.34 million and $7.92 million, respectively. At such date, the Companys commercial business loans amounted to $96.37 million, or 6.91% of the Companys total loan portfolio, and the Companys commercial real estate loans amounted to $450.61 million, or 32.33% of the Companys total loan portfolio. Commercial business and commercial real estate loans generally are considered 14 Table of Contents riskier than single-family residential loans because they have larger balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Commercial business and commercial real estate loans involve risks because the borrowers ability to repay the loans typically depends primarily on the successful operation of the businesses or the properties securing the loans. Most of the Companys commercial business loans are made to small business or middle market customers who may have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made or acquired by the Company in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. In addition to commercial real estate and commercial business loans, the Company holds a portfolio of construction loans. At December 31, 2009, the Companys construction loans amounted to $124.90 million, or 8.96% of the Companys total loan portfolio. Construction loans generally have a higher risk of loss than single-family residential mortgage loans due primarily to the critical nature of the initial estimates of a propertys value upon completion of construction compared to the estimated costs, including interest, of construction as well as other assumptions. If the estimates upon which construction loans are made prove to be inaccurate, the Company may be confronted with projects that, upon completion, have values which are below the loan amounts. The nature of the allowance for loan losses requires that the Company must use assumptions regarding, among other factors, individual loans and the economy. While the Company is not aware of any specific, material impediments impacting any of its builder/developer borrowers at this time, there continues to be nationwide reports of significant problems which have adversely affected many property developers and builders as well as the institutions that have provided those loans. If any of the builder/developers to which the Company has extended construction loans experience the type of difficulties that are being reported, it could have adverse consequences upon its future results of operations. The Bank may suffer losses in its loan portfolio despite its underwriting practices. The Bank seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in the Banks loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices include analysis of a borrowers prior credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections, valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers and verification of liquid assets. Although the Bank believes that its underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans it makes, the Bank may incur losses on loans that meet its underwriting criteria, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in the Banks allowance for loan losses. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect them. The Company and its subsidiaries operations are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by federal and state governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of the Companys operations. Banking regulations governing the Companys operations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. These laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, that may be adopted in the future, could make compliance more difficult or expensive, restrict the Companys ability to originate, broker or sell loans, further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by the Bank and otherwise adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or prospects. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was signed into law. Pursuant to the EESA, the Treasury was granted the authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing 15 Table of Contents and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets and has proposed several programs, including the purchase by the Treasury of certain troubled assets from financial institutions and the direct purchase by the Treasury of equity of financial institutions. There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that the foregoing or any other governmental program will have on the financial markets. The failure of the financial markets to stabilize and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of its Common Stock. In addition, current initiatives of President Obamas administration may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is likely to face increased regulation and supervision as a result of the recent financial crisis. Such additional regulation and supervision may increase the Companys costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities. The affects of such recently enacted, and proposed, legislation and regulatory programs on the Company cannot reliably be determined at this time. The Banks ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations which, to the extent the Company requires such dividends in the future, may affect the Companys ability to pay its obligations and pay dividends. The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations of its own. The Company currently depends on the Banks cash and liquidity as well as dividends to pay the Companys operating expenses and dividends to shareholders. No assurance can be made that in the future the Bank will have the capacity to pay the necessary dividends and that the Company will not require dividends from the Bank to satisfy the Companys obligations. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC, the Banks primary regulator, could assert that payment of dividends or other payments by the Bank are an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends sufficient to satisfy the Companys obligations or is otherwise unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to service its obligations as they become due, including payments required to be made to the FCBI Capital Trust, a business trust subsidiary of the Company, or pay dividends on the Companys Common Stock. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect the Companys financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. As a result of securities impairments and a special dividend from the Bank in 2008, the Bank does not have retained profits from which it can pay dividends. Accordingly, the Bank would need permission from the OCC prior to paying dividends to the Company. The Company faces strong competition from other financial institutions, financial service companies and other organizations offering services similar to those offered by the Company and its subsidiaries, which could hurt the Companys business. The Companys business operations are centered primarily in Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Increased competition within this region may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the types of loans and banking services that the Bank offers. These competitors include other savings associations, national banks, regional banks and other community banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, the Banks competitors include other state and national banks and major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger clients. These institutions, particularly to the extent they are more diversified than the Company, may be able to offer the same loan products and services that the Company offers at more competitive rates and prices. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking clients, the Company may be unable to continue the Banks loan and deposit growth and the Companys business, financial condition and prospects may be negatively affected. 16 Table of Contents Potential Acquisitions May Disrupt the Companys Business and Dilute Stockholder Value The Company may seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:  Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company.  Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company.  Difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company.  Potential disruption to the Companys business.  Potential diversion of the Companys managements time and attention.  The possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company.  Difficulty in estimating the value of the target company.  Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company. The Company regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of the Companys tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of TriStone Community Bank, located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Details of recent acquisitions are presented in Note 2  Merger, Acquisition and Branching Activity in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof. The Companys goodwill may be determined to be impaired. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of the Companys goodwill was $84.65 million. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measuring impairment, when available. Other acceptable valuation methods include present-value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues, or similar performance measures. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of its goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the Company would be required to write down the value of the goodwill on its balance sheet. This, in turn, would result in a charge against earnings and, thus, a reduction in the Companys stockholders equity and certain related capital measures. The Company may lose members of its management team and have difficulty attracting skilled personnel. The Companys success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense and the Company may not be able to hire such people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel of the Company could have a material adverse impact on its business because of their skills, knowledge of the Companys market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. In addition, recent regulatory proposals and guidance relating to compensation may negatively impact the Companys ability to retain and attract skilled personnel. 17 Table of Contents Higher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect the Companys financial condition. The Banks FDIC insurance premiums increased substantially in 2009, and the Company expects to pay significantly higher premiums in the future. A large number of depository institution failures have significantly depleted the DIF and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. In order to restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimum of 1.15 percent over a period of several years, the FDIC increased deposit insurance premium rates at the beginning of 2009 and imposed a special assessment on June 30, 2009, which amounted to $988 thousand for the Bank. The FDIC may impose additional special assessments in the future. In November 2009, in order to ensure sufficient liquidity to pay for projected depository institution failures, the FDIC adopted a final rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions were required to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011, and 2012. For purposes of calculating the prepaid assessment amount, an institutions assessment base for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, is increased quarterly by an estimated five percent annual growth rate through the end of 2012. An institutions assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 is equal to the rate in effect on September 30, 2009, under the proposed rule, but is increased by three basis points for all of 2011 and 2012. Under the final rule, the Company was required to make a payment to the FDIC on December 30, 2009, and to record the payment as a prepaid expense, which would be amortized to expense over three years. On December 30, 2009, the Company paid $10.88 million as prepayment of its estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011, and 2012. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, particularly if its asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. The Companys ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and its financial performance. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the Companys cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve Board. Any occurrence that may limit the Companys access to the capital markets may adversely affect the Companys capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Accordingly, the Company cannot provide any assurance that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Liquidity risk could impair the Companys ability to fund its operations and jeopardize its financial condition. Liquidity is essential to the Companys business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, equity/debt offerings and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on the Companys liquidity. The Companys access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities, or on terms attractive to the Company, could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact the Companys access to liquidity sources include a reduction in its credit ratings, if any, an increase in costs of capital in financial capital markets, a decrease in the level of its business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against the Company, or a decrease in depositor or investor confidence in it. The Companys ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to it, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. The Company has no unresolved staff comments as of the filing date of this 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
