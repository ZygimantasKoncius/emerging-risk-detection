ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN AND SHIFTING DEVELOPMENT OF THE NETWORK STORAGE SOFTWARE MARKET AND OUR RELIANCE ON OUR PARTNERS, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCURATELY PREDICTING REVENUE FOR FUTURE PERIODS AND APPROPRIATELY BUDGETING FOR EXPENSES. The rapidly evolving nature of the network storage software market in which we sell our products, the degrees of effort and success of our partners' sales and marketing efforts, and other factors that are beyond our control, reduce our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly and annual revenue. However, we must use our forecasted revenue to establish our expense budget. Most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated revenue. As a result, we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall in revenue. THE MARKET FOR STORAGE AREA NETWORKS AND NETWORK ATTACHED STORAGE ARE STILL MATURING, AND OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER IF THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AS WE EXPECT. The continued adoption of Storage Area Networks (SAN) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) solutions is critical to our future success. The markets for SAN and NAS solutions are still maturing, making it difficult to predict their potential sizes or future growth rates. If these markets develop more slowly than we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. THE MARKET FOR DISK-BASED BACKUP SOLUTIONS IS STILL MATURING, AND OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER IF IT DOES NOT CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AS WE EXPECT. The continued adoption of disk-based backup solutions, such as our VirtualTape Library software, is critical to our future success. The market for disk-based backup solutions is still maturing, making it difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate. If this market develops more slowly than we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. 9 THE MARKET FOR IP-BASED STORAGE AREA NETWORKS IS NEW AND UNCERTAIN, AND OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER IF IT DOES NOT DEVELOP AS WE EXPECT. The rapid adoption of IP-based Storage Area Networks (SAN) is important to our future success. The market for IP-based SANs is still unproven, making it difficult to predict the potential size or future growth rate. We are uncertain whether a viable market for our products will develop or be sustainable. If this market fails to develop, or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PENETRATE THE SMALL/MEDIUM BUSINESS AND SMALL OFFICE/HOME OFFICE MARKETS. We have announced plans to offer products for the small/medium business (SMB) and small office/home office (SOHO) markets. We may not be able to design or offer products attractive to the SMB and the SOHO markets, or to reach agreements with OEMs and resellers with significant presences in the SMB and SOHO markets. If we are unable to penetrate the SMB and SOHO markets, we will not be able to recoup the expenses associated with our efforts in these markets and our ability to grow revenues could suffer. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AND MANUFACTURE NEW PRODUCTS THAT ACHIEVE ACCEPTANCE IN THE NETWORK STORAGE SOFTWARE MARKET, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER. The network storage software market continues to evolve and as a result there is continuing demand for new products. Accordingly, we may need to develop and manufacture new products that address additional network storage software market segments and emerging technologies to remain competitive in the data storage software industry. We are uncertain whether we will successfully qualify new network storage software products with our customers by meeting customer performance and quality specifications or quickly achieve high volume production of storage networking software products. Any failure to address additional market segments could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. OUR PRODUCTS MUST CONFORM TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED BY CUSTOMERS IN OUR MARKETS. Our current products are only one part of a storage system. All components of these systems must comply with the same industry standards in order to operate together efficiently. We depend on companies that provide other components of these systems to conform to industry standards. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by OEM customers or end users. If other providers of components do not support the same industry standards as we do, or if competing standards emerge, our products may not achieve market acceptance, which would adversely affect our business. OUR PRODUCTS MAY HAVE ERRORS OR DEFECTS THAT COULD RESULT IN REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR COSTLY LITIGATION. Our IPStor platform is complex and is designed to be deployed in large and complex networks. Many of our customers have unique infrastructures, which may require additional professional services in order for our software to work within their infrastructures. Because our products are critical to the networks of our customers, any significant interruption in their service as a result of defects in our product could result in damage to our customers. These problems could cause us to incur significant service and engineering costs, divert engineering personnel from product development efforts and significantly impair our ability to maintain existing customer relationships and attract new customers. In addition, a product liability claim, whether successful or not, would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention. Further, if we are unable to fix the errors or other problems that may be identified in full deployment, we would likely experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share and our business and prospects would suffer. Our other products may also contain errors or defects. If we are unable to fix the errors or other problems that may be discovered, we would likely experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share and our business and prospects would suffer. 10 FAILURE OF STORAGE APPLIANCES POWERED BY IPSTOR TO INTEGRATE SMOOTHLY WITH END USER SYSTEMS COULD IMPACT DEMAND FOR THE APPLIANCES. We have entered into agreements with resellers and OEM partners to develop storage appliances that combine certain aspects of IPStor or VTL functionality with third party hardware to create single purpose turnkey solutions that are designed to be easy to deploy. If the storage appliances are not easy to deploy or do not integrate smoothly with end user systems, the basic premise behind the appliances will not be met and sales would suffer. OUR OEM CUSTOMERS REQUIRE OUR PRODUCTS TO UNDERGO A LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE QUALIFICATION PROCESS THAT DOES NOT ASSURE PRODUCT SALES. Prior to offering our products for sale, our OEM customers typically require that each of our products undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves interoperability testing of our product in the OEM's system as well as rigorous reliability testing. This qualification of a product by an OEM does not assure any sales of the product to the OEM. Despite this uncertainty, we devote substantial resources, including engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with OEMs in anticipation of sales to them. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any products with an OEM, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of that product to the OEM, which may impede our ability to grow our business. WE RELY ON OUR OEM CUSTOMERS AND RESELLERS FOR MOST OF OUR SALES. Almost all of our sales come from sales to end users of our products by our OEM customers and by our resellers. These OEM customers and resellers have limited resources and sales forces and sell many different products, both in the network storage software market and in other markets. The OEM customers and resellers may choose to focus their sales efforts on other products in the network storage software market or other markets. The OEM customers might also choose not to continue to develop or to market products which include our products. This would likely result in lower revenues to us and would impede our ability to grow our business. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON CERTAIN KEY CUSTOMERS AND A PORTION OF OUR RECEIVABLES ARE CONCENTRATED WITH TWO CUSTOMERS. We tend to have one or more customers account for 10% or more of our revenues during each fiscal quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we had two customers who together accounted for 31% of our revenues. While we believe that we will continue to receive revenue from these clients, our agreements with these clients do not have any minimum sales requirements and we cannot guarantee continued revenue. If our contracts with these partners are terminated, or if the volume of sales from these clients significantly declines, it would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, two customers accounted for a total of 28% of our outstanding receivables. While we currently have no reason to question the collectibility of these receivables, a business failure or reorganization by these customers could harm our ability to collect these receivables and could damage our cash flow. THE REPORTING TERMS OF SOME OF OUR OEM AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE US DIFFICULTY IN ACCURATELY PREDICTING REVENUE FOR FUTURE PERIODS, BUDGETING FOR EXPENSES OR RESPONDING TO TRENDS. Certain of our OEM customers do not report license revenue to us until sixty days or more after the end of the quarter in which the software was licensed. There will thus be a delay before we learn whether licensing revenue from these OEMs has met, exceeded, or fallen short of our expectations. The reporting schedule from these OEMs also means that our ability to respond to trends in the market could be harmed as well. For example, if, in a particular quarter, we see a significant increase or decrease in revenue from our channel sales or one of our other OEM partners, there will be a delay in our ability to determine whether this is an anomaly or a part of a trend. However, we must use our forecasted revenue to establish our expense budget. Most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated revenue. As a result, we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall in revenue or to increase our sales, marketing or support headcounts to take advantage of positive developments. 11 ISSUES WITH THE HARDWARE SOLD BY OUR PARTNERS COULD RESULT IN LOWER SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. As part of our sales channel, we license our software to OEMs and other partners who install our software on their own hardware or on the hardware of other third parties. If the hardware does not function properly or causes damage to customers' systems, we could lose sales to future customers, even though our software functions properly. Problems with our partners' hardware could negatively impact our business. WE MUST MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS AND DEVELOP NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH STRATEGIC INDUSTRY PARTNERS. Part of our strategy is to partner with major third-party software and hardware vendors who integrate our products into their offerings and/or market our products to others. These strategic partners often have customer or distribution networks to which we otherwise would not have access or the development of which would take up large amounts of our time and other resources. There is intense competition to establish relationships with these strategic partners. Some of our agreements with our OEM customers grant to the OEMs limited exclusivity rights to portions of our products for periods of time. This could result in lost sales opportunities for us with other customers or could cause other potential OEM partners to consider or select software from our competitors for their storage solutions. In addition, the desire for product differentiation could cause potential OEM partners to select software from our competitors. We cannot guarantee that our current strategic partners, or those companies with whom we may partner in the future, will continue to be our partners for any period of time. If our software were to be replaced in an OEM solution by competing software, or if our software is not selected by OEMs for future solutions, it would likely result in lower revenues to us and would impede our ability to grow our business. CONSOLIDATION IN THE NETWORK STORAGE INDUSTRY COULD HURT OUR STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS. In the past, companies with whom we have OEM relationships have been acquired by other companies. These acquisitions caused disruptions in the sales and marketing of our products and in 2005, acquisitions of two of our OEM partners had an impact on our revenues. If additional OEM customers are acquired, the new parents might choose to stop offering solutions containing our software. Even if the solutions continued to be offered, there might be a loss of focus and sales momentum as the companies are integrated. THE NETWORK STORAGE SOFTWARE MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INTENSE COMPETITION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. The network storage software market is intensely competitive even during periods when demand is stable. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, broader name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have. Those competitors and other potential competitors may be able to establish or to expand network storage software offerings more quickly, adapt to new technologies and customer requirements faster, and take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily. Our competitors also may: o consolidate or establish strategic relationships among themselves to lower their product costs or to otherwise compete more effectively against us; or o bundle their products with other products to increase demand for their products. In addition, some OEMs with whom we do business, or hope to do business, may enter the market directly and rapidly capture market share. If we fail to compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED GROWTH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. Achieving our anticipated growth will depend on a number of factors, some of which include: 12 o retention of key management, marketing and technical personnel; o our ability to increase our customer base and to increase the sales of our products; and o competitive conditions in the network storage infrastructure software market. We cannot assure you that the anticipated growth will be achieved. The failure to achieve anticipated growth could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. OUR REVENUES DEPEND IN PART ON SPENDING BY CORPORATE CUSTOMERS. The operating results of our business depend in part on the overall demand for network storage software. Because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers, any softness in demand for network storage software may result in decreased revenues. OUR FUTURE QUARTERLY RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. Our previous results are not necessarily indicative of our future performance and our future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly. Our future performance will depend on many factors, including: o the timing of securing software license contracts and the delivery of software and related revenue recognition; o the seasonality of information technology, including network storage products, spending; o the average unit selling price of our products; o existing or new competitors introducing better products at competitive prices before we do; o our ability to manage successfully the complex and difficult process of qualifying our products with our customers; o new products or enhancements from us or our competitors; o import or export restrictions on our proprietary technology; and o personnel changes. Many of our expenses are relatively fixed and difficult to reduce or modify. As a result, the fixed nature of our expenses will magnify any adverse effect of a decrease in revenue on our operating results. OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. For example, during the past twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the closing market price of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System fluctuated between $5.23 and $9.67. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors: o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; o failure to meet financial estimates; 13 o changes in market valuations of other technology companies, particularly those in the network storage software market; o announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; o loss of one or more key OEM customers; and o departures of key personnel. The stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED AS AN EXPENSE. The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has required companies to recognize the fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation to employees as compensation expense in the statement of operations. We must implement this FASB standard effective in the first quarter of 2006. While we are still evaluating the impact of this requirement, there will be a negative impact on our results of operations. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH MAY AFFECT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN OUR COMPANY. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights, preferences and designations, including, without limitation restricting dividends on our common stock, dilution of the voting power of our common stock and impairing the liquidation rights of the holders of our common stock, as the Board may determine without any vote of the stockholders. Issuance of such preferred stock, depending upon the rights, preferences and designations thereof may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. In addition, certain "anti-takeover" provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, among other things, may restrict the ability of our stockholders to authorize a merger, business combination or change of control. Further, we have entered into change of control agreements with certain executives, which may also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND WARRANTS, THE EXERCISE OF WHICH WOULD DILUTE THE THEN-EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS' PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,950,908 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $5.29 per share. We also have 1,006,314 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our stock option plans with respect to options that have not been granted. The exercise of all of the outstanding options and warrants and/or the grant and exercise of additional options would dilute the then-existing stockholders' percentage ownership of common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock. Moreover, the terms upon which we would be able to obtain additional equity capital could be adversely affected because the holders of such securities can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than those provided by such securities. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF A NATURAL DISASTER, TERRORIST ACTS, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS In August, 2003, our business was interrupted due to a large scale blackout in the northeastern United States. While our headquarters facilities contain redundant power supplies and generators, our domestic and foreign operations, and the operations of our industry partners, remain susceptible to fire, floods, power loss, power shortages, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. 14 Any interruption in power supply or telecommunications would be particularly disruptive to our PrimeVault backup and disaster recovery operations. If PrimeVault customers are unable to access their data, confidence in our ability to provide disaster recovery and backup services will be damaged which will impair our ability to retain existing customers, to gain new customers and to expand our operations. Terrorist actions domestically or abroad could lead to business disruptions or to cancellations of customer orders or a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology, or could have direct impact on our marketing, administrative or financial functions and our financial condition could suffer. UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT EXPORT RESTRICTIONS COULD IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR SOFTWARE TO CERTAIN END USERS. Certain of our products include the ability for the end user to encrypt data. The United States, through the Bureau of Industry Security, places restrictions on the export of certain encryption technology. These restrictions may include: the requirement to have a license to export the technology; the requirement to have software licenses approved before export is allowed; and outright bans on the licensing of certain encryption technology to particular end users or to all end users in a particular country. If we are subject to restrictions on our ability to license products to certain end users, this could negatively impact our business. THE INTERNATIONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. We sell our products worldwide. Accordingly, our operating results could be materially adversely affected by various factors including regulatory, political, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements, and acts of terrorism and international conflicts. Our international sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and, therefore, potentially less competitive in foreign markets. Additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include, among others, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, difficulties in managing international operations, decreased flexibility in matching workforce to needs as compared with the U.S., and potentially adverse tax consequences. Such factors could materially adversely affect our future international sales and, consequently, our operating results. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER. Our success is dependent upon our proprietary technology. Currently, the IPStor software suite is the core of our proprietary technology. We have one patent issued, and multiple pending patent applications, numerous trademarks registered and multiple pending trademark applications related to our products. We cannot predict whether we will receive patents for our pending or future patent applications, and any patents that we own or that are issued to us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we sell and manufacture our products, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We also rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as the confidentiality and other restrictions contained in our respective sales contracts and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections afford only limited protection. OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY CAUSE US TO BECOME INVOLVED IN COSTLY AND LENGTHY LITIGATION, WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS. In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. 15 We were already subject to one action, which alleged that our technology infringed on patents held by a third party. While we settled this litigation, the fees and expenses of the litigation as well as the litigation settlement were expensive and the litigation diverted management's time and attention. Any additional litigation, regardless of its outcome, would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management's time and attention and might subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our intellectual property rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation against us could force us to take specific actions, including: o cease selling our products that use the challenged intellectual property; o obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology or trademark, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or o redesign those products that use infringing intellectual property or cease to use an infringing product or trademark. DEVELOPMENTS LIMITING THE AVAILABILITY OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS AND COULD SUBJECT US TO COSTLY LITIGATION. Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including "Open Source" software. At least one intellectual property rights holder has alleged that it holds the rights to software traditionally viewed as Open Source. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key employees, many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace. We do not have key person life insurance on any of our personnel. Worldwide competition for skilled employees in the network storage software industry is extremely intense. If we are unable to retain existing employees or to hire and integrate new employees, our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer. In addition, companies whose employees accept positions with competitors often claim that the competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may be the subject of such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel and could incur substantial costs defending ourselves against those claims. WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESSES FROM, OR REALIZE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF ACQUISITIONS. We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions of other companies or their assets. Integration of the acquired products, technologies and businesses, could divert management's time and resources. Further, we may not be able to properly integrate the acquired products, technologies or businesses, with our existing products and operations, train, retain and motivate personnel from the acquired businesses, or combine potentially different corporate cultures. If we are unable to fully integrate the acquired products, technologies or businesses, or train, retain and motivate personnel from the acquired businesses, we may not receive the intended benefits of the acquisitions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. IF ACTUAL RESULTS OR EVENTS DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FUTURE PERIODS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosure in accordance with generally accepted account principles requires management to establish policies that contain estimates and assumptions that 16 affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report on Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies essential to preparing our financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual future results may differ materially from these estimates. We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, our estimates and assumptions. LONG TERM CHARACTER OF INVESTMENTS Our present and future equity investments may never appreciate in value, and are subject to normal risks associated with equity investments in businesses. These investments may involve technology risks as well as commercialization risks and market risks. As a result, we may be required to write down some or all of these investments in the future. UNKNOWN FACTORS Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or which currently we deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us. ITEM 1B.
