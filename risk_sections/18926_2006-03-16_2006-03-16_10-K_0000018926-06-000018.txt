Item 1A. Risk Factors RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Risk Factors Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Please be aware that additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business operations. Risks Related to Our Business We face competition, which could adversely affect us. As a result of various technological, regulatory and other changes, the telecommunications industry has become increasingly competitive, and we expect these trends to continue. As we discuss further below, competition has resulted in access line losses, which we expect will accelerate in 2006. In our LEC markets, we face competition from wireless telephone services, which we expect to increase if wireless providers continue to expand and improve their network coverage, lower their prices and offer enhanced services. In certain of our LEC markets, we face competition from cable television operators and CLECs. Over time, we expect to face additional local exchange competition from more recent market entrants, including VoIP providers and electric utilities, and we expect continued competition from alternative networks or non-carrier systems designed to reduce demand for our switching or access services. The Internet, long distance and data services markets are also highly competitive, and we expect that competition will intensify in these and other markets that we serve. We expect competition to intensify as a result of new competitors and the development of new technologies, products and services. We cannot predict which future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what funding will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on how well we market our products and services and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive and technological factors affecting the industry, including changes in regulation (which may affect us differently from our competitors), changes in consumer preferences or demographics, and changes in the product offerings or pricing strategies of our competitors. Many of our current and potential competitors have market presence, engineering, technical and marketing capabilities and financial, personnel and other resources substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of our competitors own larger and more diverse networks, can conduct operations or raise capital at a lower cost than we can, are subject to less regulation, have lower benefit plan costs, or have substantially stronger brand names. Consequently, some competitors may be able to charge lower prices for their products and services, to offer more attractive service bundles, to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, to adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, and to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we can. Competition could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers and market share, (ii) the possibility of customers reducing their usage of our services or shifting to less profitable services, (iii) our need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive and (iv) our inability to diversify by successfully offering new products or services. We could be harmed by rapid changes in technology. The communications industry is experiencing significant technological changes, particularly in the areas of VoIP, data transmission and wireless communications. Recently, several large electric utilities have announced plans to offer communications services that compete with LECs. Some of our competitors may enjoy network advantages that will enable them to provide services more efficiently or at lower cost. Rapid changes in technology could result in the development of products or services that compete with or displace those offered by traditional LECs. We may not be able to obtain timely access to new technology on satisfactory terms or incorporate new technology into our systems in a cost effective manner, or at all. If we cannot develop new products to keep pace with technological advances, or if such products are not widely embraced by our customers, we could be adversely impacted. We cannot assure you that our business will grow or that our diversification efforts will be successful. Due to the above-cited changes, the telephone industry has recently experienced a decline in access lines, intrastate minutes of use and long distance minutes of use. While we have not in the past suffered as much as a number of other ILECs from recent industry challenges, the recent decline in access lines and usage, coupled with the other changes resulting from competitive, technological and regulatory developments, could materially adversely effect our core business and future prospects. Our access lines declined 4.3% in 2005 and we expect our access lines to decline between 4.5% and 5.5% in 2006. We also earned less intrastate revenues in 2005 due to reductions in intrastate minutes of use (partially due to the displacement of minutes of use by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services). We believe our intrastate minutes of use will continue to decline, although the magnitude of such decrease is uncertain. Until recently, we have traditionally sought growth largely through acquisitions of properties similar to those currently operated by us. However, we cannot assure you that properties will be available for purchase on terms attractive to us, particularly if they are burdened by regulations, pricing plans or competitive pressures that are new or different from those historically applicable to our incumbent properties. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will be able to arrange additional financing on terms acceptable to us. In recent years, we have attempted to broaden our service and product offerings. During 2005, we began providing co-branded satellite television services and reselling wireless services as part of our bundled product and service offerings. Our reliance on other companies and their networks to provide these services could constrain our flexibility and limit the profitability of these new offerings. In addition, we recently launched our facilities-based digital video offering to select markets in Wisconsin. We anticipate these new offerings will dilute our earnings for 2006 by approximately $.06 to $.08 per share and will provide lower profit margins than many of our traditional services. As such, to the extent revenues from these new offerings replace revenues lost from declines in our traditional LEC business, our overall profit margins will decline. We cannot assure you that our recent diversification efforts will be successful. Future deterioration in our financial performance could adversely impact our credit ratings, our cost of capital and our access to the capital markets. Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our operations. In the past few years, we have expanded our operations through acquisitions and new product and service offerings, and we may pursue similar growth opportunities in the future. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, including our ability to: · retain and attract technological, managerial and other key personnel · effectively manage our day to day operations while attempting to execute our business strategy of expanding our emerging businesses · realize the projected growth and revenue targets developed by management for our newly acquired and emerging businesses, and · continue to identify new acquisition or growth opportunities that we can finance, consummate and operate on attractive terms. Expansion opportunities pose substantial challenges for us to integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality, and to maintain other necessary internal controls. We cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful, or that we will realize our expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits. If we are not able to meet these challenges effectively, our results of operations may be harmed. Network disruptions could adversely affect our operating results. To be successful, we will need to continue providing our customers with a high capacity, reliable and secure network. Some of the risks to our network and infrastructure include: · power losses or physical damage to our access lines, whether caused by fire, adverse weather conditions, terrorism or otherwise · capacity limitations · software and hardware defects · breaches of security, including sabotage, tampering, computer viruses and break-ins, and · other disruptions that are beyond our control. Disruptions or system failures may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers. If service is not restored in a timely manner, agreements with our customers or service standards set by state regulatory commissions could obligate us to provide credits or other remedies, and this would reduce our revenues or increase our costs. Service disruptions could also damage our reputation with customers, causing us to lose existing customers or have difficulty attracting new ones. Any failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure could harm our business. The capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure (including our billing systems) is important to the operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system failures. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs are important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include the delayed implementation of new service offerings, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development resources. We rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors to operate our business. We depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure. If these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering these network components to us on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. To the extent that proprietary technology of a supplier is an integral component of our network, we may have limited flexibility to purchase key network components from alternative suppliers. We also rely on a limited number of other communications companies in connection with reselling long distance, wireless and satellite entertainment services to our customers. In addition, we rely on a limited number of software vendors to support our business management systems. In the event it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement supplies or services on economically attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our services. Our relationships with other communications companies are material to our operations and their financial difficulties may adversely affect us. We originate and terminate calls for long distance carriers and other interexchange carriers over our network in exchange for access charges that represent a significant portion of our revenues. Should these carriers go bankrupt or experience substantial financial difficulties, our inability to timely collect access charges from them could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. We depend on key members of our senior management team. Our success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of a limited number of senior officers, none of whom are parties to employment agreements. Competition for senior management in our industry is intense and we may have difficulty retaining our current senior managers or attracting new ones in the event of terminations or resignations. We could be affected by certain changes in labor matters. At December 31, 2005, approximately 26% of our employees were members of 12 separate bargaining units represented by two different unions. From time to time, our labor agreements with these unions lapse, and we typically negotiate the terms of new agreements. We cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations. We may be unable to reach new agreements, and union employees may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services. In addition, new labor agreements may impose significant new costs on us, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations in the future. Moreover, our post-employment benefit offerings cause us to incur costs not faced by many of our competitors, which could ultimately hinder our competitive position. Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment Our revenues could be materially reduced or our expenses materially increased by changes in regulations. The majority of our revenues are substantially dependent upon regulations which, if changed, could result in material revenue reductions. Laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in the courts, and could be changed by federal or state legislators. Any of the following could significantly impact us: Risk of loss or reduction of network access charge revenues. A significant portion of our network access revenues are paid to us by intrastate and interstate long distance carriers for originating and terminating calls in the regions we serve. The amount of access charge revenues that we receive is based largely on rates set by federal and state regulatory bodies, and such rates could change. In 2003, the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding that is expected to overhaul the current system for compensating carriers originating, terminating, carrying and delivering telecommunications traffic. This proceeding could materially impact our results of operations. In addition, our financial results could be harmed if carriers that use our access services become financially distressed or bypass our networks, either due to changes in regulation or other factors. Furthermore, access charges currently paid to us could be diverted to competitors who enter our markets or expand their operations, either due to changes in regulation or otherwise. Risk of loss or reduction of support fund payments. We receive a substantial portion of our revenues from the federal Universal Service Fund and, to a lesser extent, intrastate support funds. These governmental programs are reviewed and amended from time to time, and we cannot assure you that they will not be changed or impacted in a manner adverse to us. In August 2004, a federal-state joint board requested comments on the FCC’s current rules for high-cost support payments to rural telephone companies, including comments on whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner that would adversely affect larger rural LECs such as us. In August 2005, this board sought comments on proposals to modify the distribution of certain key federal support funds. Pending judicial appeals and Congressional proposals create additional uncertainty regarding our future receipt of support payments. We cannot estimate the impact that these developments will have on us. Recent changes in the nationwide average cost per loop factors used by the FCC to allocate support funds have reduced our receipts from the main support program administered by the federal Universal Service Fund. These changes reduced our receipts from such program by $13.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004, and we expect these changes will further reduce our receipts from such program by approximately $8 to $12 million in 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, the number of eligible telecommunications carriers receiving support payments from this program continues to increase, which, coupled with other factors, is placing additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide support payments to all eligible recipients, including us. As a result of the continued increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor (caused by a decrease in the size of the USF High Cost Loop support program and increases in requests for support from the Universal Service Fund), we believe the aggregate level of payments we receive from the Universal Service Fund will continue to decline in the near term under the FCC’s current rules. Risk of loss of statutory exemption from burdensome interconnection rules imposed on incumbent local exchange carriers. Approximately 50% of our telephone access lines are exempt from the 1996 Act’s more burdensome requirements governing the rights of competitors to interconnect to incumbent local exchange carrier networks and to utilize discrete network elements of the incumbent’s network at favorable rates. If state regulators decide that it is in the public’s interest to impose these more burdensome interconnection requirements on us, we would be required to provide unbundled network elements to competitors. As a result, more competitors could enter our traditional telephone markets than we currently expect, resulting in lower revenues and higher additional administrative and regulatory expenses. Risk of losses from earnings reviews. Notwithstanding the movement toward alternative state regulation, LECs operating approximately 38% of our total access lines continue to be subject to “rate of return” regulation for intrastate purposes. These LECs remain subject to the powers of state regulatory commissions to conduct earnings reviews and adjust service rates, which could lead to revenue reductions. Risks posed by costs of regulatory compliance. Regulations continue to create significant compliance costs for us. Challenges to our tariffs by regulators or third parties or delays in obtaining certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and, if successful, such challenges could adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers. Our business also may be impacted by legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland security, minimizing environmental impacts, or addressing other issues that impact our business. For example, existing provisions of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act require communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities, and services are able to facilitate authorized electronic surveillance. We expect our compliance costs to increase if future legislation or regulations continue to increase our obligations to assist other governmental agencies. Regulatory changes in the communications industry could adversely affect our business by facilitating greater competition against us. The 1996 Act provides for significant changes and increased competition in the communications industry, including the local communications and long distance industries. This Act and the FCC’s implementing regulations remain subject to judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus making it difficult to predict what effect the legislation will have on us and our competitors. Several regulatory and judicial proceedings have recently concluded, are underway or may soon be commenced, that address issues affecting our operations and those of our competitors. Moreover, certain communities nationwide have expressed an interest in establishing a municipal telephone utility that would compete for customers. We cannot predict the outcome of these developments, nor can we assure that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on us or our industry. We are subject to significant regulations that limit our flexibility. As a diversified full service incumbent local exchange carrier, or ILEC, we have traditionally been subject to significant regulation that does not apply to many of our competitors. For instance, unlike many of our competitors, we are subject to federal mandates to share facilities, file and justify tariffs, maintain certain accounts and file reports, and state requirements that obligate us to maintain service standards and limit our ability to change tariffs in a timely manner. This regulation imposes substantial compliance costs on us and restricts our ability to raise rates, to compete and to respond rapidly to changing industry conditions. Although newer alternative forms of regulation permit us greater freedoms in several states in which we operate, they nonetheless typically impose caps on the rates that we can charge our customers. As our business becomes increasingly competitive, regulatory disparities between us and our competitors could impede our ability to compete. Litigation and different objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and impede our ability to respond to new regulations. Moreover, changes in tax laws, regulations or policies could increase our tax rate, particularly if state regulators continue to search for additional revenue sources to address budget shortfalls. We are unable to predict the future actions of the various regulatory bodies that govern us, but such actions could materially affect our business. For a more thorough discussion of the regulatory issues that may affect our business, see “- Operations” above. Other Risks We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. This could hinder our ability to adjust to changing market and economic conditions, as well as our ability to access the capital markets to refinance maturing debt in the ordinary course of business. In connection with executing our business strategies, we are continuously evaluating the possibility of acquiring additional communications assets, and we may elect to finance acquisitions by incurring additional indebtedness. Moreover, to respond to the competitive challenges discussed above, we may be required to raise substantial additional capital to finance new product or service offerings. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are able to obtain additional financing, our credit ratings could be adversely affected. As a result, our borrowing costs would likely increase, our access to capital may be adversely affected and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness could be adversely affected. Our agreements and organizational documents and applicable law could limit another party’s ability to acquire us at a premium. Under our articles of incorporation, each share of common stock that has been beneficially owned by the same person or entity continually since May 30, 1987 generally entitles the holder to ten votes on all matters duly submitted to a vote of shareholders. As of February 28, 2006, the holders of our ten-vote shares held approximately 41% of our total voting power. In addition, a number of other provisions in our agreements and organizational documents, including our shareholder rights plan, and various provisions of applicable law may delay, defer or prevent a future takeover of CenturyTel unless the takeover is approved by our board of directors. This could deprive our shareholders of any related takeover premium. We face other risks. The list of risks above is not exhaustive, and you should be aware that we face various other risks.
