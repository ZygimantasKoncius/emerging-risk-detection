Except for the 2009 fiscal year which contained 53 weeks, each of the Company’s fiscal years presented above contained 52 weeks. All references to years relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years. The financial position and results of operations of Wendy’s International, Inc. (“Wendy’s”) are included commencing with the date of the Wendy’s Merger, September 29, 2008. Immediately prior to the Wendy’s Merger, each share of our Class B common stock was converted into Class A common stock on a one for one basis. In connection with the May 28, 2009 amendment and restatement of our Certificate of Incorporation, our former Class A common stock is now referred to as “Common Stock.” The financial position and results of operations of RTM Restaurant Group (“RTM”) are included commencing with its acquisition by the Company on July 25, 2005. Deerfield & Company LLC (“Deerfield”), in which the Company held a 63.6% capital interest from July 22, 2004 through its sale on December 21, 2007, Deerfield Opportunities Fund, LLC (the “Opportunities Fund”), which commenced on October 4, 2004 and in which our investment was effectively redeemed on September 29, 2006, and DM Fund LLC, which commenced on March 1, 2005 and in which our investment was effectively redeemed on December 31, 2006, reported on a calendar year ending on December 31 through their respective sale or redemption dates. (2) Selected financial data reflects the changes related to the adoption of the following accounting standards: (a) As of January 1, 2007, we utilized a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. We utilized a two-step process of evaluating a tax position, whereby an entity first determines if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or Table of Contents - 29 - - litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured for purposes of financial statement recognition as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon being effectively settled. There was no effect on the 2007 or prior period statements of operations. However, there was a net reduction of $2.3 in stockholders’ equity as of January 1, 2007. (b) As of January 1, 2007, the Company accounted for scheduled major aircraft maintenance overhauls in accordance with the direct expensing method under which the actual cost of such overhauls was recognized as expense in the period it is incurred. Previously, the Company accounted for scheduled major maintenance activities in accordance with the accrue-in-advance method under which the estimated cost of such overhauls was recognized as expense in periods through the scheduled date of the respective overhaul with any difference between estimated and actual cost recorded in results from operations at the time of the actual overhaul. The Company credited $0.6 and $0.7 to operating profit and $0.4 and $0.5 to income from continuing operations and net income for 2006 and 2005, respectively. (c) As of January 2, 2006, the Company measured the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. The Company previously used the intrinsic value method to measure employee share-based compensation. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation cost for the Company’s stock options was measured as the excess, if any, of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant, or at any subsequent measurement date as a result of certain types of modifications to the terms of its stock options, over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. There was no effect from the adoption of this new accounting methodology on the financial statements for all periods presented prior to the accounting change. (d) As of December 29, 2008, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to non-controlling interests (formerly referred to as minority interests). This adoption resulted in the retrospective reclassification of minority interests from its former presentation as a liability to “Stockholder’s equity.” The reclassifications were $0.l, $0.9, $14.2 and $43.4 for 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. Additionally, in accordance with the new guidance, the loss from continuing operations in 2006 and 2005 excludes the effect of income attributable to non-controlling interests of $11.5 and $8.8, respectively. Income attributable to non-controlling interests in 2008 and 2007 was not material. (3) For the purposes of calculating income per share amounts for 2007, net income was allocated between the shares of the Company’s common stock and the Company’s Class B common stock based on the actual dividend payment ratio. For the purposes of calculating loss per share, the net loss for all years through 2008 was allocated equally between Common Stock and Class B common stock. (4) The number of shares used in the calculation of diluted income per share in 2009 and 2007 consist of the weighted average common shares outstanding for each class of common stock and potential shares of common stock reflecting the effect of 483 dilutive stock options and nonvested restricted shares for 2009 and 129 for the Company’s common stock and 759 for the Company’s Class B common stock for 2007. The number of shares used in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share is the same as basic income (loss) per share for 2008, 2006 and 2005 since all potentially dilutive securities would have had an antidilutive effect based on the loss from continuing operations for these years. (5) Reflects significant charges recorded in 2009 of $82.1 million charged to operating profit for impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and $50.9 million charged to income from continuing operations and net income related to these charges. (6) Reflects certain significant charges and credits recorded during 2008 as follows: $460.1 charged to operating loss consisting of a goodwill impairment for the Arby’s Company-owned restaurant reporting unit; $484.0 charged to loss from continuing operations and net loss representing the aforementioned $460.1 charged to operating loss and other than temporary losses on investments of $112.7 partially offset by $88.8 of income tax benefit related to the above charges. (7) Reflects certain significant charges and credits recorded during 2007 as follows: $45.2 charged to operating profit, consisting of facilities relocation and corporate restructuring costs of $85.4 less $40.2 from the gain on sale of the Company’s interest in Deerfield; $16.6 charged to income from continuing operations and net income representing the aforementioned $45.2 charged to operating profit offset by $15.8 of income tax benefit related to the above charge, and a $12.8 previously unrecognized prior year contingent tax benefit related to certain severance obligations to certain of the Company’s former executives. (8) Reflects a significant charge recorded during 2006 as follows: $9.0 charged to loss from continuing operations and net loss representing a $14.1 loss on early extinguishments of debt related to conversions or effective conversions of the Company’s 5% convertible notes due 2023 and prepayments of term loans under the Company’s senior secured term loan facility, partially offset by an income tax benefit of $5.1 related to the above charge. Table of Contents - 30 - - (9) Reflects certain significant charges and credits recorded during 2005 as follows: $58.9 charged to operating loss representing (1) share-based compensation charges of $28.3 representing the intrinsic value of stock options which were exercised by the Chairman and then Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairman and then President and Chief Operating Officer and subsequently replaced on the date of exercise, the grant of contingently issuable performance-based restricted shares of the Company’s Class A and Class B common stock and the grant of equity interests in two of the Company’s then subsidiaries, (2) a $17.2 loss on settlements of unfavorable franchise rights representing the cost of settling franchise agreements acquired as a component of the acquisition of RTM with royalty rates below the 2005 standard 4% royalty rate that the Company receives on new franchise agreements and (3) facilities relocation and corporate restructuring charges of $13.5; $67.5 charged to loss from continuing operations representing the aforementioned $58.9 charged to operating loss and a $35.8 loss on early extinguishments of debt upon a debt refinancing in connection with the acquisition of RTM, both partially offset by $27.2 of income tax benefit relating to the above charges; and $64.2 charged to net loss representing the aforementioned $67.5 charged to loss from continuing operations partially offset by income from discontinued operations of $3.3 principally resulting from the release of reserves for state income taxes that were no longer required. Table of Contents - 31 - - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. (“Wendy’s/Arby’s” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “we”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere within this report. Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections” in “Part 1” preceding “Item 1 - Business.” You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A above as well as our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On September 29, 2008, we completed the merger (the “Wendy’s Merger”) with Wendy’s International, Inc. (“Wendy’s”) described below under “Introduction and Executive Overview – Merger with Wendy’s International, Inc.”, and our corporate name Triarc Companies, Inc., (“Triarc”), was changed to Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. The references to the “Company” or “we” for periods prior to September 29, 2008 refer to Triarc and its subsidiaries. Because the Wendy’s Merger did not occur until the first day of our 2008 fourth quarter, only the fourth quarter results of operations of Wendy’s are included in our 2008 results. The results of operations discussed below for 2008 and 2007 will not be indicative of future results due to the consummation of the Wendy’s Merger as well as the 2007 sale of our interest in Deerfield & Company LLC (“Deerfield”) discussed below. Introduction and Executive Overview Our Business Wendy’s/Arby’s is the parent company of its wholly-owned subsidiary holding company Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants, LLC (“Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants”). Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants is the parent company of Wendy’s International, Inc. and Arby’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“ARG” or “Arby’s”), which are the owners and franchisors of the Wendy’s® and Arby’s® restaurant systems, respectively. We currently manage and internally report our operations as two business segments: the operation and franchising of Wendy’s restaurants, including its wholesale bakery operations, and the operation and franchising of Arby’s restaurants. As of January 3, 2010, the Wendy’s restaurant system was comprised of 6,541 restaurants, of which 1,391 were owned and operated by the Company. As of January 3, 2010, the Arby’s restaurant system was comprised of 3,718 restaurants, of which 1,169 were owned and operated by the Company. All 2,560 Wendy’s and Arby’s Company-owned restaurants are located principally in the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada (the “North America Restaurants”). In 2007, we also operated in the asset management business through our 63.6% capital interest in Deerfield which was sold on December 21, 2007 (the “Deerfield Sale”) to Deerfield Capital Corp. (“DFR”). Restaurant business revenues for 2009 include: (1) $3,086.5 million of sales from Company-owned restaurants, (2) $111.8 million from the sale of bakery items and kid’s meal promotion items to our franchisees and others, (3) $353.1 million from royalty income from franchisees and (4) $29.4 million of other franchise related revenue. Our revenues increased significantly in 2009 and 2008 due to the Wendy’s Merger. All of our Wendy’s and substantially all of our Arby’s royalty agreements provide for royalties of 4.0% of franchise revenues for the year ended January 3, 2010. In our former asset management business, revenues were derived through the date of the Deerfield Sale in the form of asset management and related fees from our management of (1) collateralized debt obligation vehicles (“CDOs”) and (2) investment funds and private investment accounts (“Funds”). Our restaurant businesses have recently experienced trends in the following areas: Revenues · Industry-wide declines in same-store sales of all segments of the restaurant industry, including quick service restaurants (“QSR”); · Continued lack of general consumer confidence in the economy and the effect of decreases in many consumers’ discretionary income caused by factors such as (1) volatility in the financial markets and recessionary economic conditions, including high unemployment levels and (2) a significant decline in the real estate market, although that market has shown some improvement in recent months; · Continued and increasingly aggressive price competition in the QSR industry, as evidenced by (1) value menus, which offer lower prices on some menu items, (2) the use of coupons and other price discounting and (3) combination meal concepts, which offer a complete meal at an aggregate price lower than the price of individual food and beverage items; · Competitive pressures due to extended hours of operation by many QSR competitors, including breakfast and late night hours; · Competitive pressures from operators outside the QSR industry, such as the deli sections and in-store cafes of major grocery and other retail store chains, convenience stores and casual dining outlets offering take-out food; Table of Contents - 32 - - · Increased availability to consumers of product choices, including (1) healthy products driven by a greater consumer awareness of nutritional issues, (2) beverage programs which offer a wider selection of premium non-carbonated beverages, including coffee and tea products, and (3) sandwiches with perceived higher levels of freshness, quality and customization; and · Competitive pressures from an increasing number of franchise opportunities seeking to attract qualified franchisees. Cost of Sales · Decreasing commodity prices which have reduced our food costs in the second half of 2009; · Federal, state and local legislative activity, such as minimum wage increases and mandated health and welfare benefits which is expected to continue to increase wages and related fringe benefits, including health care and other insurance costs; and · Legal or regulatory activity related to nutritional content or menu labeling which results in increased operating costs. Other · A significant portion of both our Wendy’s and Arby’s restaurants are franchised and, as a result, we receive revenue in the form of royalties (which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), rent and other fees from franchisees. Arby’s franchisee related accounts receivable and estimated reserves for uncollectibility have increased significantly, and may continue to increase, as a result of the deteriorating financial condition of some of our franchisees. The financial condition of a number of Arby’s franchisees resulted in a net decrease in the number of franchised restaurants in 2009 and also affects franchisees’ ability to make required contributions to national and local advertising programs; · Weakness in the overall credit markets, including availability in the lending markets typically used to finance new unit development and remodels. Tightened credit conditions and economic pressures have negatively impacted franchisees, including the ability of some franchisees to meet their commitments under development, rental and franchise license agreements. We experience these trends directly to the extent they affect the operations of our Company-owned restaurants and indirectly to the extent they affect sales by our franchisees and, accordingly, the royalties and franchise fees we receive from them. Business Highlights We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business, strengthen our competitive position and enhance our profitability through the execution of the following strategies: · Grow same-store sales at Wendy’s and Arby’s by introducing innovative new menu items, enhancing the customer experience with operational excellence, and improving affordability with everyday value menu items; · Continue to improve Wendy’s Company-owned restaurant margins; · Expand our restaurant base in North America and accelerate our program to remodel restaurants; · Invest in our international business to grow substantially in key markets outside of North America; and · Possibly acquire other restaurant companies. Key Business Measures We track our results of operations and manage our business using the following key business measures: · Same-Store Sales We report Arby’s North America Restaurants same-store sales commencing after a store has been open for fifteen continuous months. Wendy’s North America Restaurants same-store sales are reported after a store has been open for at least fifteen continuous months as of the beginning of the fiscal year. These methodologies are consistent with the metrics used by our management for internal reporting and analysis. Same-store sales exclude the impact of currency translation. · Restaurant Margin We define restaurant margin as sales from Company-owned restaurants (excluding sales of bakery items and kid’s meal promotion items to franchisees) less cost of sales (excluding costs of bakery items and kid’s meal promotion items sold to franchisees), divided by sales from Company-owned restaurants (excluding sales of bakery items and kid’s meal promotion items sold to franchisees). Restaurant margin is influenced by factors such as restaurant openings and closures, price Table of Contents - 33 - - increases, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives, featured products, product mix, the level of our fixed and semi-variable costs, and fluctuations in food and labor costs. Merger with Wendy’s International, Inc. On September 29, 2008, we completed the Wendy’s Merger in an all-stock transaction in which Wendy’s shareholders received 4.25 shares of Wendy’s/Arby’s Class A Common Stock for each share of Wendy’s common stock owned. Immediately prior to the Wendy’s Merger, each share of our Class B Common Stock was converted into Class A Common Stock on a one for one basis (the “Conversion”). In connection with the May 28, 2009 amendment and restatement of our Certificate of Incorporation, our Class A Common Stock is now referred to as “Common Stock.” Senior Notes On June 23, 2009, Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants issued $565.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes will mature on July 15, 2016 and accrue interest at 10.00% per annum, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15, the first payment of which was made on January 15, 2010. The Senior Notes were issued at 97.533% of the principal amount, representing a yield to maturity of 10.50% and resulting in net proceeds paid to us of $551.1 million. This original $13.9 million discount is being accreted and the related charge included in “Interest expense” until the Senior Notes mature. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis by certain direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants (collectively, the “Guarantors”). Deerfield On December 21, 2007, we completed the Deerfield Sale to DFR resulting in non-cash proceeds aggregating $134.6 million, consisting of 9.6 million shares of convertible preferred stock of DFR (“the DFR Preferred Stock”) with a then estimated fair value of $88.4 million and $48.0 million principal amount of series A senior secured notes of DFR due in December 2012 (the “DFR Notes”) with a then estimated fair value of $46.2 million. We also owned an additional 0.2 million common shares in DFR. On March 11, 2008, DFR stockholders approved the one-for-one conversion of all its outstanding convertible preferred stock into DFR common stock which converted the 9.6 million preferred shares we held into a like number of shares of common stock. During the first quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the distribution of our 9.8 million shares of DFR common stock, which included the 0.2 million common shares of DFR discussed above, to our stockholders. The dividend, which was valued at $14.5 million, was paid on April 4, 2008 to holders of record of our Common Stock and our then outstanding Class B common stock. In 2008, in response to unanticipated credit and liquidity events, DFR announced changes to its business model and significant losses. Based on these events and their negative effect on the market price of DFR common stock, we concluded that the fair value and, therefore, the carrying value of our investment in the 9.8 million common shares was impaired. As a result, we recorded an other than temporary loss which is included in “Other than temporary losses on investments,” of $68.1 million during the first quarter of 2008. As a result of the distribution of the DFR common stock, the income tax loss that resulted from the decline in value of our investment of $68.1 million was not deductible for income tax purposes and no income tax benefit was recorded related to this loss. However, due to significant financial weakness in the credit markets, publicly available information of DFR, and our ongoing assessment of the likelihood of full repayment of the principal amount of the DFR Notes, we recorded an allowance for doubtful collectability of $21.2 million on the DFR Notes in the fourth quarter of 2008. This charge is included in “Other than temporary losses on investments.” Related Party Transactions Corporate Restructuring In 2007, we completed the transition that was announced in April 2007 whereby we closed our New York headquarters and combined our corporate operations with our restaurant operations in Atlanta, Georgia (the “Corporate Restructuring”). To facilitate this transition, we had entered into contractual settlements (the “Contractual Settlements”) with our Chairman, who was also our then Chief Executive Officer, and our Vice Chairman, who was our then President and Chief Operating Officer, (collectively, the “Former Executives”) evidencing the termination of their employment agreements and providing for their resignation as executive officers as of June 29, 2007 (the “Separation Date”). In addition, we sold properties and other assets at our former New York headquarters in 2007 to an affiliate of the Former Executives and we incurred charges for the transition severance arrangements of other New York headquarters’ executives and employees who continued to provide services as employees through the 2008 first quarter. The Corporate Restructuring included the transfer of substantially all of our senior executive responsibilities to our executive team in Atlanta, Georgia. Equities Account Prior to 2007, we invested $75.0 million in brokerage accounts (the “Equities Account”), which was managed by a management company (the “Management Company”) formed by the Former Executives and a director, who is our former Vice Chairman Table of Contents - 34 - - (collectively with the Former Executives, the “Principals”). The Equities Account was invested principally in equity securities, cash equivalents and equity derivatives of a limited number of publicly-traded companies. In addition, the Equities Account sold securities short and invested in market put options in order to lessen the impact of significant market downturns. In June 2009, we and the Management Company entered into a withdrawal agreement (the “Withdrawal Agreement”) which provided that we would be permitted to withdraw all amounts in the Equities Account on an accelerated basis (the “Early Withdrawal”) effective no later than June 26, 2009. Prior to the Withdrawal Agreement and as a result of an investment management agreement with the Management Company, which was terminated on June 26, 2009, we had not been permitted to withdraw any amounts from the Equities Account until December 31, 2010, although $47.0 million was released from the Equities Account in 2008 subject to an obligation to return that amount to the Equities Account by a specified date. In consideration for obtaining such Early Withdrawal right, we agreed to pay the Management Company $5.5 million (the “Withdrawal Fee”), were not required to return the $47.0 million referred to above and were no longer obligated to pay investment management and incentive fees to the Management Company. The Equities Account investments were liquidated in June 2009 for $37.4 million (the “Equities Sale”), of which $31.9 million was received by us, net of the Withdrawal Fee, and for which we realized a gain of $2.3 million in 2009, both included in “Investment expense (income), net.” Services Agreement Wendy’s/Arby’s and the Management Company entered into a new services agreement (the “New Services Agreement”) which commenced on July 1, 2009 and will continue until June 30, 2011, unless sooner terminated. Under the New Services Agreement, the Management Company will assist us with strategic merger and acquisition consultation, corporate finance and investment banking services and related legal matters. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, we are paying the Management Company a service fee of $0.25 million per quarter, payable in advance commencing July 1, 2009. In addition, in the event the Management Company provides substantial assistance to us in connection with a merger or acquisition, corporate finance and/or similar transaction that is consummated at any time during the period commencing on the date the New Services Agreement was executed and ending six months following the expiration of its term, we will negotiate a success fee to be paid to the Management Company which is reasonable and customary for such transactions. Under a prior services agreement which commenced on June 30, 2007 and expired on June 30, 2009, (the “Services Agreement”) the Management Company provided a broader range of professional and strategic services to us in connection with our corporate restructuring and the transition of all executive management responsibilities as described above. We paid approximately $5.4 million in fees for corporate finance advisory services in 2009 to the Management Company in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes. Liquidation Services Agreement On June 10, 2009, Wendy’s/Arby’s and the Management Company entered into a liquidation services agreement (the “Liquidation Services Agreement”) whereby, the Management Company will assist us in the sale, liquidation or other disposition of our cost investments and DFR Notes, (the “Legacy Assets”), which are not related to the Equities Account. As of the date of the Liquidation Services Agreement, the Legacy Assets were valued at $36.6 million (the “Target Amount”). The Liquidation Services Agreement, which expires June 30, 2011, provides that we will pay the Management Company a fee of $0.9 million in two installments, which is being recognized over the term of the agreement and included in “General and administrative.” In addition, in the event that any or all of the Legacy Assets are sold, liquidated or otherwise disposed of and the aggregate net proceeds to us are in excess of the Target Amount, then we will pay the Management Company a success fee equal to 10% of the aggregate net proceeds in excess of the Target Amount. Aircraft Agreements During 2009, the time share agreements with the Principals and the Management Company for the use of two of our aircraft expired. One of the aircraft was sold in 2009 to an unrelated third party. Wendy’s/Arby’s and TASCO, LLC (an affiliate of the Management Company) (“TASCO”) entered into an aircraft lease agreement (the “Aircraft Lease Agreement”) for the other aircraft that was previously under a time share agreement. The Aircraft Lease Agreement provides that the Company will lease such corporate aircraft to TASCO from July 1, 2009 until June 30, 2010. The Aircraft Lease Agreement provides that TASCO will pay $10,000 per month for such aircraft plus substantially all operating costs of the aircraft including all costs of fuel, inspection, servicing and storage, as well as operational and flight crew costs relating to the operation of the aircraft, and all transit maintenance costs and other maintenance costs required as a result of TASCO’s usage of the aircraft. We will continue to be responsible for calendar-based maintenance and any extraordinary and unscheduled repairs and/or maintenance for the aircraft, as well as insurance and other costs. The Aircraft Lease Agreement may be terminated by us without penalty in the event we sell the aircraft to a third party, subject to a right of first refusal in favor of the Management Company with respect to such a sale. Table of Contents - 35 - - Supply Chain Relationship Agreement During the 2009 fourth quarter, Wendy’s and its franchisees entered into a purchasing co-op relationship agreement (the “Co-op Agreement”) to establish a new Wendy’s purchasing co-op, Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. (“QSCC”). QSCC now manages food and related product purchases and distribution services for the Wendy’s system in the United States and Canada. Through QSCC, Wendy’s and Wendy’s franchisees purchase food, proprietary paper and operating supplies under national contracts with pricing based upon total system volume. QSCC’s supply chain management will facilitate continuity of supply and provide consolidated purchasing efficiencies while monitoring and seeking to minimize possible obsolete inventory throughout the North American supply chain. The system’s purchasing function for 2009 and prior was performed and paid for by Wendy’s. In order to facilitate the orderly transition of the 2010 purchasing function for North American operations, Wendy’s transferred certain contracts, assets and certain Wendy’s purchasing employees to QSCC in the first quarter of 2010. Pursuant to the terms of the Co-op Agreement, Wendy’s is required to pay $15.5 million to QSCC over an 18 month period in order to provide funding for start-up costs, operating expenses and cash reserves. Future operations will be funded by all members of QSCC, including Wendy’s and its franchisees. The required payments by Wendy’s under the Co-op Agreement were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2009 and included in “General and administrative.” Effective January 4, 2010, the QSCC will be leasing 9,333 square feet of office space from Wendy’s for a two year period for an average annual rental of $0.1 million with five one-year renewal options. ARCOP, Inc., a not-for-profit purchasing cooperative, negotiates contracts with approved suppliers on behalf of ARG and Arby’s franchisees and operates under a previously established agreement similar to the Wendy’s Co-op Agreement. Revolving credit facilities On December 31, 2009, AFA Service Corporation (“AFA”), an independently controlled advertising cooperative for the Arby’s restaurant system in which we have voting interests of substantially less than 50%, entered into a revolving loan agreement with ARG. This agreement, which provided for ARG to make revolving loans of up to $5.5 million to AFA, was amended on February 25, 2010 to provide for revolving loans up to $14.5 million. Under the terms of this agreement; outstanding amounts are due through April 4, 2011 and bear interest at 7.5%. As of January 3, 2010, the outstanding balance under this agreement was $5.1 million. Presentation of Financial Information Our fiscal reporting periods consist of 53 or 52 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31 and are referred to herein as (1) “the year ended January 3, 2010” or “2009”, which consisted of 53 weeks and (2) “the year ended December 28, 2008” or “2008” and “the year ended December 31, 2007” or “2007,” both of which consisted of 52 weeks.

Table of Contents - 38 - - Sales Change 2009 2008 (in millions) Wendy’s $ 1,603.3 $ 530.8 Arby’s (67.3 ) 18.1 $ 1,536.0 $ 548.9 The increase in sales in both 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to the Wendy’s Merger. In addition, sales for the 53rd week in 2009 for Wendy’s and Arby’s were $35.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively. Wendy’s North America Company-owned same-store sales for 2009, excluding the impact of fewer restaurants serving breakfast in 2009 as compared to 2008 and the effect of the 53rd week in 2009, would have decreased approximately 0.3%. In 2009, Arby’s sales decrease was primarily attributable to the 8.2% decrease in Arby’s North America Company-owned same-store sales. In 2008, Arby’s sales increase was attributable to the $80.0 million increase in sales from the 70 net Arby’s North America Company-owned restaurants added in 2008 as substantially offset by a $61.9 million decrease in sales due to a 5.8% decrease in Arby’s North America Company-owned same-store sales. Of the 45 net restaurants acquired from franchisees in 2008, 41 are in the California market (the “California Restaurants”) and were purchased from a franchisee on January 14, 2008 (the “California Restaurant Acquisition”). The California Restaurants generated approximately $36.0 million of sales in 2008. In 2009 and 2008 Arby’s North America Company-owned same-store sales were impacted by the restaurant industry trends, negative general economic trends and competitive pressures described in “Introduction and Executive Overview – Our Business.” In addition, the 2009 Arby’s same-store sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in the number of national advertising campaigns; however, certain aggressive Arby’s value promotions partially mitigated this negative impact. Franchise Revenues Change 2009 2008 (in millions) Wendy’s $ 228.2 $ 74.6 Arby’s (6.2 ) (1.1 ) $ 222.0 $ 73.5 The increase in franchise revenues in both 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to the Wendy’s Merger. Wendy’s franchised restaurant sales were not significantly impacted by changes in the number of restaurants serving breakfast in 2009. Wendy’s franchised restaurant closings include 71 restaurants in Japan which closed at the expiration of the franchise agreement on December 31, 2009. Franchise revenues for the 53rd week in 2009 for Wendy’s and Arby’s were approximately $4.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The decrease in Arby’s franchise revenues in 2009 was primarily attributable to the 9.0% decrease in same-store sales for North America franchised restaurants. The 2008 decrease was primarily attributable to the effect of the January 2008 acquisition of the California Restaurants whereby previously franchised restaurants became Company-owned and the 3.6% decrease in same-store sales for Arby’s franchised restaurants. In 2009 and 2008, same-store sales of our Arby’s franchised restaurants were negatively impacted by the same industry and economic factors mentioned above. In addition, in 2009, the franchised restaurants were disproportionately negatively affected by less national media advertising as certain underpenetrated franchise markets did not have sufficient local media advertising to offset the decrease in national advertising. In 2008, however, the use of incremental national media advertising had a positive effect on the Arby’s franchised restaurants which slightly offset the negative impact of the industry and economic factors discussed above. Asset Management and Related Fees As a result of the Deerfield Sale on December 21, 2007, there were no asset management and related fees in 2009 or 2008. Our asset management and related fees in 2007 were generated entirely from the management of CDOs and Funds by Deerfield. Table of Contents - 39 - - Restaurant Margin 2009 2008 2007 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Wendy’s 14.9% N/A 11.7% (a) N/A N/A Arby’s 13.9% (2.2) ppt 16.1% (3.6) ppt 19.7% Consolidated 14.6% (0.2) ppt 14.7% (5.0) ppt 19.7% ________ (a) The 2008 Wendy’s restaurant margin includes only the 2008 fourth quarter. The percentage increase in the Wendy’s restaurant margin in 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 was primarily attributable to improvements in labor and certain controllable costs, partially due to ongoing operational improvements and the effect of price increases in 2009. The percentage decrease in the Arby’s restaurant margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to the effect of the decrease in Arby’s same-store sales without comparable reductions in fixed and semi-variable costs and the targeted product discounting of a number of Arby’s menu items which was partially offset by decreases in commodity costs. The impact of the 53rd week in 2009 on restaurant margin was not material for either brand. The percentage decrease in the Arby’s restaurant margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 was due to (1) the effect of the decrease in Arby’s same-store sales without comparable reductions in fixed and semi-variable costs, (2) higher utilities, (3) fuel costs under new distribution contracts that became effective in the third quarter of 2007, (4) increased advertising which was anticipated to generate additional customer traffic but did not, (5) an increase in labor costs primarily due to the effect of Federal and state minimum wage increases in 2008 and (6) higher cost of beef and other commodities. Cost of Services As a result of the Deerfield Sale, we did not incur any cost of services in 2009 or 2008. For 2007, our cost of services was from the management of CDOs and Funds by Deerfield. General and Administrative Change 2009 2008 (in millions) Wendy’s Merger $ 161.7 $ 79.5 Wendy’s Co-op Agreement 15.5 - Integration costs related to the Wendy’s Merger 14.3 2.3 Incentive compensation 9.7 (9.8 ) Provision for doubtful accounts 6.5 0.5 Salaries and wages 4.0 4.5 Services agreements (5.3 ) 3.5 Aircraft expenses (2.1 ) (0.4 ) Asset management segment costs - (24.8 ) Corporate Restructuring - (14.0 ) Relocation costs - (2.2 ) Other (0.3 ) 4.2 $ 204.0 $ 43.3 The increases for 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to the Wendy’s Merger as well as increases in (1) integration costs related to the Wendy’s Merger which increased to $16.6 million in 2009 from $2.3 million in 2008 and (2) salaries and wages due to staffing and other expenses associated with the establishment of the shared services center in Atlanta, Georgia. Our 2009 general and administrative expenses were also significantly impacted by (1) required future payments expensed in the 2009 fourth quarter as a result of the Wendy’s Co-op Agreement, (2) increases in certain incentive compensation accruals due to stronger consolidated operating performance versus plan in 2009 as compared to weaker consolidated operating performance versus plan in 2008 and (3) an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts primarily associated with the collectability of Arby’s franchisee receivables. The 2009 increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by (1) a decrease in fees for the New Services Agreement, as compared to fees incurred under the Services Agreement in 2008 and (2) a decrease in costs associated with our corporate aircraft as a result of the termination of the time share agreements and the establishment of a new aircraft lease agreement with the Principals and the Management Company, and the sale of one of the aircraft in 2009. Our 2008 general and administrative expenses were also impacted by an increase associated with the full year effect of fees for professional and strategic services provided to us under the Services Agreement that became effective in June 2007 as part of the Corporate Restructuring. The 2008 increases in general and administrative Table of Contents - 40 - - expenses were partially offset by (1) expenses incurred in 2007 by our former asset management segment, which did not recur in 2008 as a result of the Deerfield Sale in December 2007, (2) a decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses as a result of the completion of our Corporate Restructuring which commenced in 2007, (3) a decrease in incentive compensation accruals due to weaker consolidated operating performance versus plan in 2008 as compared to our operating performance versus plan in 2007 and (4) a decrease in relocation costs principally attributable to additional costs in the prior year related to estimated declines in market value and increased carrying costs for homes we purchased for resale from relocated employees. Depreciation and Amortization Change 2009 2008 (in millions) Wendy’s restaurants, primarily properties $ 104.2 $ 23.8 Arby’s restaurants, primarily properties (5.0 ) 4.3 Asset management - (4.9 ) General corporate 2.8 (1.1 ) $ 102.0 $ 22.1 The 2009 and 2008 increases were primarily related to the increase in long-lived assets as a result of the Wendy’s Merger. The 2009 increase was also affected by a $6.5 million one-time increase in depreciation as a result of refinements to the Wendy’s purchase price allocation (including long-lived assets) which was recorded in the 2009 first quarter and by an increase in the amortization of capitalized software related to the Wendy’s Merger integration and the establishment of the shared services center in Atlanta, Georgia. These 2009 increases were partially offset by the reduction in depreciation of Arby’s long-lived assets for which we have recorded impairment charges. The 2008 increase was also affected by the increase in long-lived assets as a result of the California Restaurant Acquisition and other new and remodeled units partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization charges from our asset management business as a result of the Deerfield Sale. Goodwill Impairment We operate in two business segments consisting of two restaurant brands: (1) Wendy’s restaurants and (2) Arby’s restaurants. Each segment includes reporting units for Company-owned restaurants and franchise operations for purposes of measuring goodwill impairment. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarters of each of the fiscal years presented. As a result of our testing, we concluded that the fair value of the Wendy’s reporting units in 2009 and 2008 and the Arby’s franchise reporting unit in all three years exceeded their respective carrying amounts. In 2008, as a result of the acceleration of the general economic and market downturn as well as continued decreases in Arby’s same store sales, we concluded that the carrying amount of the Arby’s Company-owned restaurant reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges of $460.1 million in 2008. As of the end of 2009 and 2008, we did not have any goodwill recorded for our Arby’s Company-owned restaurants reporting units. There was no impairment of the Arby’s Company-owned restaurants reporting unit in 2007. Impairment of Other Long-Lived Assets Change 2009 2008 (in millions) Arby’s restaurants, primarily properties at underperforming locations $ 48.5 $ 5.4 Wendy’s restaurants, primarily properties at underperforming locations 21.9 1.6 Asset management - (4.5 ) General corporate, aircraft (7.5 ) 9.6 $ 62.9 $ 12.1 The increases in charges for the impairment of other long-lived assets was primarily the result of the deterioration in operating performance of certain Wendy’s (in 2009 only) and Arby’s restaurants (for all years presented). We also recorded impairment on one of our corporate aircraft held-for-sale in 2008 and, to a lesser extent, in 2009. The increases in 2008 were partially offset by the impairment in 2007 of other long-lived assets in our asset management business which did not recur as a result of the Deerfield Sale. Table of Contents - 41 - - Facilities Relocation and Corporate Restructuring Change 2009 2008 (in millions) Restaurants, primarily Wendy’s severance costs $ 7.1 $ 2.5 General corporate, Corporate Restructuring (completed in 2007) - (84.0 ) $ 7.1 $ (81.5 ) Interest Expense Change 2009 2008 (in millions) Senior Notes $ 32.0 $ - Wendy’s debt 31.6 10.7 Financing cost 6.1 1.8 Arby’s debt 1.1 3.3 Corporate debt 0.8 (0.2 ) Senior secured term loan (11.2 ) (9.2 ) Other (0.7 ) (0.7 ) $ 59.7 $ 5.7 The 2009 expense was principally affected by interest on the Senior Notes issued in June 2009 as discussed below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Senior Notes” as well as, in both 2009 and 2008, interest expense on debt assumed as a result of the Wendy’s Merger. Excluding the effect of the Senior Notes issuance and the effect of the Wendy’s debt assumed, the decrease in 2009 interest expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the senior secured term loan interest expense as a result of significant voluntary prepayments, partially offset by the write-off of financing costs related to these prepayments and an increase in the interest rate on such loan. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Senior Secured Term Loan” below for further discussion. Excluding the effect of the Wendy’s Merger on the 2008 fourth quarter, the decrease in the 2008 expense was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense due to voluntary prepayments of the senior secured term loan as well as a decrease in the variable interest rates as compared to 2007. Investment (Expense) Income, Net Change 2009 2008 (in millions) Recognized net gains $ (4.5 ) $ (44.1 ) Withdrawal Fee (5.5 ) - Interest income (1.0 ) (7.8 ) Other (1.4 ) (0.8 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (52.7 ) Our net gains include realized gains on available-for-sale securities and cost method investments and unrealized and realized gains on derivative instruments. The change in our recognized net gains in 2009 is primarily due to: (1) $2.8 million of net unrealized and realized losses on swap derivatives held in 2008, (2) $2.3 million of net gains that were realized upon the Equities Sale and (3) a $2.2 million decrease in net realized losses on available for sale securities held in 2008 as offset by (1) a $9.0 decrease in net unrealized and realized gains on securities sold short held in 2008, (2) $1.2 million of realized losses on securities sold short in 2009, (3) $0.8 million decrease in unrealized gains on put and call option derivatives that were sold in 2009 and (4) $0.8 million decrease in gains from the sale of cost method investments. The Withdrawal Fee relates to the fee paid to the Management Company for the Equities Sale as discussed in “Introduction and Executive Overview – Equities Account.” The change in our recognized net gains in 2008 is primarily related to: (1) $22.4 million decrease in realized gains in 2007 on our available-for-sale investments primarily reflecting $15.2 million of gains on two of those investments in 2007 and the reduction in value of our investments in the deteriorating market, (2) $13.9 million of realized gains in 2007 on the sale of two of our cost method investments and (3) $8.4 million of gains realized in 2007 related to the transfer of several cost method investments from the deferred compensation trusts established for the benefit of the Former Executives. Table of Contents - 42 - - In 2008, our interest income decreased principally due to: (1) lower average outstanding balances of our interest-bearing investments principally as a result of cash equivalents used in connection with our Corporate Restructuring, (2) interest income recognized in 2007 at our former asset management segment and (3) a decrease in interest rates. Other Than Temporary Losses on Investments Change 2009 2008 (in millions) DFR common stock $ (68.1 ) $ 68.1 DFR Notes (21.2 ) 21.2 Available-for-sale securities, including CDOs (12.3 ) 3.2 Cost method investments (7.2 ) 10.3 $ (108.8 ) $ 102.8 · Losses due to the reduction in value of our investments Based on a review of our unrealized investment losses in 2009, 2008 and 2007, we determined that the decreases in the fair value of certain of our investments were other than temporary due to the severity of the decline, the financial condition of the investee and the prospect for future recovery in the market value of the investment. Accordingly, we recorded other than temporary losses on certain common stock, certain available-for-sale securities and certain cost method investments. The 2009 decrease in losses due to reduction in value of our investments was principally impacted by the 2008 loss on our DFR common stock discussed in “Introduction and Executive Overview – Deerfield”, which did not recur. In addition, 2009 losses on certain available-for-sale securities were not as significant due primarily to the Equities Sale in June 2009. Losses in 2009 related to cost method investments were not as significant due to improved market conditions as compared to 2008. The 2008 increase in losses on available-for sale securities and $1.8 million of the increase in losses on cost method investments was primarily due to a reduction in the value of these investments due to overall market conditions as compared to 2007. · Losses due to investment collectability There were no losses due to investment collectability in 2009. The 2008 increase in losses due to investment collectability was impacted by the allowance for doubtful collectability on the DFR Notes, discussed above in “Introduction and Executive Overview – Deerfield.” · Losses due to illiquidity There were no 2009 losses due to illiquidity. The 2008 increase in losses due to illiquidity was due to the 2008 write-down of $8.5 million on our entire cost method investment in Jurlique International Pty Ltd, a privately-held Australian upscale skin care company (“Jurlique”). Based on financial results provided by Jurlique, which noted significant declines in operations in 2008, its budget for 2009, economic conditions, illiquidity of the private company stock, and our internal valuations of Jurlique, we determined that our investment in this company was more than likely not recoverable.

Discrete items may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. Taxes changed as a result of discrete items of (1) the 2009 tax benefit on recognizing previously unrecognized state net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, in connection with the dissolution of our captive insurance company, (2) the 2008 tax provision on the impairment of goodwill as described above in ‘Goodwill Impairment” as a result of non-deductible financial reporting goodwill in excess of tax goodwill, (3) the 2008 tax provision on a loss which is not deductible for tax purposes in connection with the decline in value of our investment in the common stock of DFR and related declared dividend as described in “Introduction and Executive Overview – Deerfield”, (4) the 2008 tax benefit on foreign tax credits net of related taxes on the distribution of foreign earnings and (5) the 2007 tax benefit on recognizing a previously unrecognized contingent tax benefit in connection with the settlement of certain obligations to the Former Executives.

Outlook for 2010 Sales We anticipate that certain of the negative factors described above which affected our 2009 Company-owned same-store sales, including current restaurant industry-wide sales trends, the uncertain economic environment, high unemployment and competitive discounting, will continue to negatively impact sales for 2010. We expect that Wendy’s increasing emphasis on everyday value products, as well as anticipated menu mix in 2010, which includes the introduction of new premium products, will have a favorable impact on sales. In addition, we anticipate that Arby’s increasing emphasis on everyday value menu items will have a favorable impact on sales. For 2010, the net impact of new store openings and closings is not expected to have a significant impact on consolidated sales. Table of Contents - 44 - - Franchise Revenues We expect that the sales trends for franchised restaurants at Wendy’s and Arby’s will continue to be generally impacted by many of the same factors described above under “Sales.” Due to the economic environment and potential franchise closures, contributions to Arby’s local advertising cooperatives may decrease. The decrease in local marketing activity should be offset by the increase in national media. Restaurant Margin Except for the cost of commodities which is not expected to significantly impact the restaurant margins for Wendy’s and Arby’s in 2010, we expect that the other factors described above which affected restaurant margin for Company-owned restaurants in 2009 for the Wendy’s and Arby’s brands will continue to impact restaurant margin in 2010. The Wendy’s restaurant margin is expected to be favorably impacted by a continuation of the cost controls implemented throughout 2009. We expect that the effect on Arby’s restaurant margins of the emphasis on everyday value menu items will be significantly offset by a reduction in other discounted product promotional activity. General and Administrative We expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2010 primarily as a result of the 2009 accrual for the formation of the Wendy’s Co-op as discussed in “Introduction and Executive Overview – Supply Chain Relationship Agreement,” which will not recur, a decrease in integration costs related to the Wendy’s Merger and continued merger-related synergies and other cost savings initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization We expect that our depreciation and amortization expenses will decrease in 2010 primarily due to the additional depreciation that resulted from valuation adjustments on long-lived assets from the Wendy’s Merger, which was recorded in the 2009 first quarter and will not recur, and a reduction in depreciation of Wendy’s and Arby’s long-lived assets for which we have recorded impairment charges in 2009. Facilities Relocation and Corporate Restructuring We do not expect to incur additional facilities relocation and corporate restructuring charges with respect to the Wendy’s Merger in 2010. Interest Expense We expect that our interest expense for 2010 will increase compared to 2009 primarily as a result of the full year effect of interest expense on the Senior Notes discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Long-term Debt” and the effect of increased interest rates under our amended senior secured term loan. These increases are expected to be partially offset by the effect on interest expense of the 2009 prepayment of the senior secured term loan and the full year effect of the interest rate swaps discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Derivatives.” Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash for 2009 Cash and cash equivalents (“cash”) totaled $591.7 million at January 3, 2010 compared to $90.1 million at December 28, 2008. For the year ended January 3, 2010, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $298.8 million, primarily from the following significant items: · Our net income of $5.1 million; · Depreciation and amortization of $190.3 million; · Impairment of other long-lived assets charges of $82.1 million; · The write-off and amortization of deferred financing costs of $15.8 million; · Distributions received from our investment in a joint venture of $14.6 million; and · Changes in operating assets and liabilities which resulted in a net use of cash of $2.7 million primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in accounts and notes receivable and a $2.5 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in inventories and a $4.0 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Table of Contents - 45 - - Additionally, for the year ended January 3, 2010, we had the following significant sources and uses of cash other than from operating activities: · Proceeds of $607.5 million primarily from the issuance of the Senior Notes discussed below under “Long-term Debt”; · Net repayments of other long-term debt of $210.4 million, including a prepayment of $132.5 million on our senior secured term loan; · Cash capital expenditures totaling $101.9 million, including the construction of new restaurants (approximately $18.1 million) and the remodeling of existing restaurants; · Deferred financing costs of $38.4 million; · Net investment proceeds of $38.1 million; · Repurchases of common stock of $72.9 million, including commissions of $0.3 million and excluding $5.8 million of repurchases that were not settled until after year end; and · Dividend payments of $28.0 million. The net cash provided by continuing operations before the effect of exchange rate changes on cash was approximately $502.6 million. Sources and Uses of Cash for 2010 Our anticipated consolidated cash requirements for continuing operations for 2010, exclusive of operating cash flow requirements, consist principally of: · Cash capital expenditures of approximately $165.0 million as discussed below in “Capital Expenditures”; · Quarterly cash dividends aggregating up to approximately $26.6 million as discussed below in “Dividends”; · Scheduled debt principal repayments aggregating $22.1 million, including a $5.0 million mandatory prepayment on our secured equipment term loan; · Potential repurchases of common stock of up to $121.6 million (including $5.8 million of repurchases in 2009 that were not settled until after the 2009 year end) under the currently authorized stock buyback program, including $41.8 million, excluding commissions of $0.2 million, already purchased through February 26, 2010; · Scheduled payments of $14.3 million pursuant to the Co-op Agreement; · Severance payments of approximately $5.8 million related to our facilities relocation and corporate restructuring accruals; and · The costs of any potential business acquisitions or financing activities. Based upon current levels of operations, we expect that cash flows from operations and available cash will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements for the next twelve months. Working Capital and Capitalization Working capital, which equals current assets less current liabilities, was $403.8 million at January 3, 2010, reflecting a current ratio, which equals current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.8:1. Working capital at January 3, 2010 increased $525.5 million from a deficit of $121.7 million at December 28, 2008, primarily due to $298.8 million in net cash provided by continuing operating activities and $259.4 million in net cash provided by continuing financing activities. Our total capitalization at January 3, 2010 was $3,859.2 million, consisting of stockholders’ equity of $2,336.3 million and long-term debt of $1,522.9 million, including current portion. Our total capitalization at January 3, 2010 increased $364.2 million from $3,495.0 million at December 28, 2008 and was principally impacted by the following: · The $411.3 million net increase in long-term debt is principally due to the issuance of $565.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes less the $132.5 million prepayment on our senior secured term loan; · Cash dividends paid of $28.0 million; · Net income of $5.1 million; · The components of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” that are not included in the calculation of net income, of which $37.6 million principally reflects the currency translation adjustment in 2009; and · Repurchases of common stock of $78.4 million, excluding commissions of $0.3 million and including $5.8 million of repurchases that were not settled until after year end.

See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this document for more information related to our long-term debt obligations. Senior Notes On June 23, 2009, our subsidiary Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants issued $565.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes will mature on July 15, 2016 and accrue interest at 10.00% per annum, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15. The first payment was made on January 15, 2010. The Senior Notes were issued at 97.533% of the principal amount, representing a yield to maturity of 10.50% and resulting in net proceeds paid to us of $551.1 million. The $13.9 million discount is being accreted and the related charge included in “Interest expense” until the Senior Notes mature. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis by the Guarantors. An Indenture for the Senior Notes dated as of June 23, 2009 (the “Indenture”) among Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants, the Guarantors and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), includes certain customary covenants that, subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications, limit the ability of Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt or issue preferred or disqualified stock, pay dividends on equity interests, redeem or repurchase equity interests or prepay or repurchase subordinated debt, make some types of investments and sell assets, incur certain liens, engage in transactions with affiliates (except on an arms-length basis), and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets. The covenants generally do not restrict Wendy’s/Arby’s or any of its subsidiaries that are not Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants’ subsidiaries. Senior Secured Term Loan The Arby’s Credit Agreement was amended and restated as of March 11, 2009 and includes an amended senior secured term loan (the “Amended Term Loan”) and an amended senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Amended Revolver”). As a result of an agreement entered into on March 17, 2009, the amount of the Amended Revolver increased from $100.0 million to $170.0 million. Also, Wendy’s and certain of its affiliates became co-obligors in addition to Arby’s and certain of its affiliates. The Amended Term Loan is due July 2012 and the Amended Revolver expires in July 2011. On June 10, 2009, Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the amended and restated Arby’s Credit Agreement (as so amended, the “Credit Agreement”) which, among other things (1) permitted the issuance by Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants of the Senior Notes described above and the incurrence of such debt, and permitted Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants to dividend to Wendy’s/Arby’s the net cash proceeds of the Senior Notes issuance less $132.5 million used to prepay the Amended Term Loan and pay accrued interest thereon and certain other payments, (2) modified certain total leverage financial covenants, added certain financial covenants based on senior secured leverage ratios and modified the minimum interest coverage ratio, (3) permitted the prepayment at any time prior to maturity of certain senior notes of Wendy’s and eliminated certain incremental debt baskets in the covenant prohibiting the incurrence of additional indebtedness and (4) modified the interest margins to provide that the margins will fluctuate based on Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants’ corporate credit rating. The Amended Term Loan and amounts borrowed under the Amended Revolver under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our option at either (1) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), as adjusted pursuant to applicable regulations (but not less than 2.75%), plus an interest rate margin of 4.00%, 4.50%, 5.00% or 6.00% per annum, depending on Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants’ corporate credit rating, or (2) the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), which is the higher of the interest rate announced by the administrative agent for the Credit Agreement as its base rate and the Federal funds rate plus 0.50% (but not less that 3.75%), in either case plus an interest rate margin of 3.00%, 3.50%, 4.00% or 5.00% per annum, depending on Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants’ corporate credit rating. Based on Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants’ corporate credit rating at the effective date of Amendment No. 1 and as of January 3, 2010, the applicable interest rate margins available to us were 4.50% for Eurodollar Rate borrowings and 3.50% for Base Table of Contents - 47 - - Rate borrowings. Since the effective date of Amendment No. 1 and as of January 3, 2010, we have elected to use the Base Rate which resulted in a rate of 7.25% as of January 3, 2010. Concurrent with the closing of the issuance of the Senior Notes, we prepaid the Amended Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $132.5 million and accrued interest thereon. During 2009, we borrowed a net total of $51.2 million under the Amended Revolver, however, no amounts were outstanding as of January 3, 2010. The Amended Revolver includes a sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit up to $50.0 million. The availability under the Amended Revolver as of January 3, 2010 was $136.4 million, which is net of $33.6 million for outstanding letters of credit. Other Revolving Credit Facilities Wendy’s U.S. advertising fund has a revolving line of credit of $25.0 million. Neither the Company nor Wendy’s guarantees this debt. The advertising fund facility was established to fund the advertising fund operations. The availability under this line of credit as of January 3, 2010 was $20.3 million. At January 3, 2010, one of Wendy’s Canadian subsidiaries had a revolving credit facility of C$6.0 million which bears interest at the Bank of Montreal Prime Rate and is guaranteed by Wendy’s. The availability under this facility as of January 3, 2010 was C$5.7 million. AFA’s bank line of credit matured and was not renewed as of January 2010. In connection with the establishment of a revolving loan agreement with ARG discussed above under “Introduction and Executive Overview – Related Party Transactions,” AFA drew on the ARG line and repaid all amounts outstanding under its bank line of credit on December 28, 2009. On December 31, 2009, AFA entered into a revolving loan agreement with ARG. This agreement, which provided for ARG to make revolving loans of up to $5.5 million to AFA, was amended on February 25, 2010 to provide for revolving loans up to $14.5 million. Under the terms of this agreement, outstanding amounts are due through April 4, 2011 and bear interest at 7.5%. As of January 3, 2010, the outstanding balance under this agreement was $5.1 million. Derivatives During the third quarter of 2009, we entered into several interest rate swap agreements (the “Interest Rate Swaps”) with notional amounts totaling $361.0 million that swap the fixed rate interest rates on our 6.20% and 6.25% Wendy’s Senior Notes for floating rates. The Company’s primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Interest Rate Swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and qualify for the short-cut method under the applicable guidance. At January 3, 2010, the fair value of our Interest Rate Swaps was $1.6 million and has been included in “Deferred costs and other assets” and as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the 6.20% and 6.25% Wendy’s Senior Notes. Debt Covenants The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require Wendy’s and ARG and their subsidiaries to maintain certain aggregate maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios and restrict their ability to incur debt, pay dividends or make other distributions to Wendy’s/Arby’s, make certain capital expenditures, enter into certain fundamental transactions (including sales of assets and certain mergers and consolidations) and create or permit liens. We were in compliance with all the covenants of the Credit Agreement as of January 3, 2010 and we expect to remain in compliance with all of these covenants for the next twelve months. As of January 3, 2010, there was $306.5 million available for the payment of dividends indirectly to Wendy’s/Arby’s under the covenants of the Credit Agreement which includes the net proceeds, as defined, from the Senior Notes less any dividends paid since their issuance. The indentures that govern Wendy’s 6.20% and 6.25% Senior Notes and 7% Debentures (the "Wendy's Notes") contain covenants that specify limits on the incurrence of indebtedness. We were in compliance with these covenants as of January 3, 2010 and project that we will be in compliance with these covenants for the next twelve months. A significant number of the underlying leases in the Arby’s restaurants segment for sale-leaseback obligations and capitalized lease obligations, as well as the operating leases, require or required periodic financial reporting of certain subsidiary entities within ARG or of individual restaurants, which in many cases have not been prepared or reported. The Company has negotiated waivers and alternative covenants with its most significant lessors which substitute consolidated financial reporting of ARG for that of individual subsidiary entities and which modify restaurant level reporting requirements for more than half of the affected leases. Nevertheless, as of January 3, 2010, the Company was not in compliance, and remains not in compliance, with the reporting requirements under those leases for which waivers and alternative financial reporting covenants have not been negotiated. However, none of the lessors has asserted that the Company is in default of any of those lease agreements. The Company does not believe that such non-compliance will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Table of Contents - 48 - - Credit Ratings Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries with specific debt issuances (Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants and Wendy’s) are rated by Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”). The most recent credit ratings, assigned in June 2009, for Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc., Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants and the Wendy’s Notes were as follows: S&P Moody's Corporate family/corporate credit Entity Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants Rating B+ B2 Outlook Negative Stable Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants Senior Notes B+ B2 Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants Term Loan BB Ba2 Wendy’s Notes B- Caa1 There are many factors that could lead to future upgrades or downgrades of our credit ratings. Credit rating upgrades or downgrades could lead to, among other things, changes in borrowing costs and changes in our ability to access capital markets on acceptable terms. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the expected payments under our outstanding contractual obligations at January 3, 2010: Fiscal Years 2010 2011-2012 2013-2014 After 2014 Total (in millions) Long-term debt (a) $ 115.9 $ 627.0 $ 378.8 $ 857.5 $ 1,979.2 Sale-leaseback obligations (b) 14.7 30.1 29.5 152.2 226.5 Capitalized lease obligations (b) 17.7 27.1 24.2 110.4 179.4 Operating leases (c) 146.7 261.5 225.8 1,125.2 1,759.2 Purchase obligations (d) 51.5 62.0 60.1 106.6 280.2 Other (e) 25.9 1.4 0.1 - 27.4 Total (f) $ 372.4 $ 1,009.1 $ 718.5 $ 2,351.9 $ 4,451.9 (a) Excludes sale-leaseback and capitalized lease obligations, which are shown separately in the table. The table above includes interest of approximately $611.1 million. We have estimated the interest on our variable-rate debt based on current base rates, the current interest rate margin and the amortization schedule in our Credit Agreement. The table above also reflects the effect of interest rate swaps entered into in 2009 which lowered our interest rate on certain of our fixed-rate debt. These amounts exclude the effects of the original issue discount on our Senior Notes and the fair value adjustments related to certain debt assumed in the Wendy’s Merger. (b) Excludes related sublease rental receipts of $9.4 million on sale-leaseback obligations and $3.5 million on capitalized lease obligations. The table above includes interest of approximately $101.3 million for sale-leaseback obligations and $89.5 million for capitalized lease obligations. (c) Represents the present value of minimum lease cash payments. Excludes related sublease rental receipts of $76.1 million. (d) Includes (1) $249.7 million remaining for beverage purchase requirements for Wendy’s and Arby’s restaurants, (2) $2.0 million for advertising commitments, (3) $18.6 million for capital expenditures and (4) $9.9 million of other purchase obligations. (e) Represents (1) $15.5 million for funding related to the Wendy’s Co-op Agreement, (2) $6.1 million severance for Wendy’s and Wendy’s/Arby’s personnel in connection with the Wendy’s Merger and New York headquarters’ employees and (3) $5.8 million for stock repurchases in 2009 not settled until 2010. Table of Contents - 49 - - (f) Excludes obligations for uncertain income tax positions of $31.0 million. We are unable to predict when, and if, cash payments on any of this accrual will be required. Capital Expenditures In 2009, cash capital expenditures amounted to $101.9 million and non-cash capital expenditures, consisting of capitalized leases and certain sale-leaseback obligations, amounted to $6.4 million. In 2010, we expect that cash capital expenditures will amount to approximately $165.0 million, principally relating to (1) remodeling approximately 100 Arby’s and 100 Wendy’s Company-owned restaurants, (2) ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for our Company-owned restaurants and (3) the opening of an estimated 12 new Wendy’s Company-owned restaurants. We have $18.6 million of outstanding commitments for capital expenditures as of January 3, 2010, of which we expect $14.0 million to be paid in 2010. Dividends On March 30, 2009, June 15, 2009, September 15, 2009 and December 15, 2009, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.015 per share on our Common Stock, aggregating $28.0 million. During the 2010 first quarter, we declared dividends of $0.015 per share to be paid on March 15, 2010 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2010. If we pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the remainder of 2010 at the same rate as declared in our 2010 first quarter, our total cash requirement for dividends for all of 2010 would be approximately $26.6 million based on the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding at February 26, 2010. We currently intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance that any quarterly dividends will be declared or paid in the future or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any. Stock Repurchases As approved by our Board of Directors, our management is currently authorized, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible, to repurchase through January 2, 2011 up to a total of $200.0 million of our Common Stock. As of January 3, 2010, we had repurchased 16.9 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $78.4 million, excluding commissions of $0.3 million and including $5.8 million of repurchases that were not settled until after year end. Since that date and through February 26, 2010, we repurchased an additional 9.1 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $41.8 million, excluding commissions of $0.2 million and excluding the repurchases that were not settled until after the 2009 year end. Income Taxes The Wendy’s Merger qualified as a tax-free reorganization. Based on the merger exchange ratio, the former shareholders of Wendy’s owned approximately 80% of the total stock of Wendy’s/Arby’s outstanding immediately after the Wendy’s Merger. Therefore, the Wendy’s Merger was treated as a reverse acquisition for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. As a result of the reverse acquisition, Wendy’s/Arby’s and its subsidiaries became part of the Wendy’s consolidated group with Wendy’s/Arby’s as its new parent. In addition, Wendy’s/Arby’s had a short taxable year in 2008 ending on the date of the Wendy’s Merger. Also as a result of the Wendy’s Merger, for U.S. Federal tax purposes there was an ownership change which places a limit on the amount of a company’s net operating losses that can be deducted annually. The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) is currently conducting an examination of our 2010 and 2009 U.S. Federal income tax years as part of the Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”). As part of CAP, tax years are audited on a contemporaneous basis so that all or most issues are resolved prior to the filing of the tax return. Wendy’s has been participating in CAP since its 2006 tax year. The Wendy’s federal income tax returns for 2007 and prior years have been settled. The Company participated in CAP beginning with the tax period ended December 28, 2008 and this return is settled. Our December 28, 2008 U.S. Federal income tax return included Wendy’s for all of 2008 and Wendy’s/Arby’s for the period September 30, 2008 to December 28, 2008. Wendy’s/Arby’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2005 to September 29, 2008 are not currently under examination by the IRS. However, some of Wendy’s/Arby’s state income tax returns and some of the Wendy’s state income tax returns for periods prior to the Wendy’s Merger are currently under examination. Certain of these states have issued notices of proposed tax assessments aggregating $4.3 million. We dispute these notices and believe ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Table of Contents - 50 - - Guarantees and Other Contingencies As of January 3, 2010 (in millions) Lease guarantees and contingent rent on leases (1) $ 108.6 Loan guarantees (2) $ 25.8 Letters of credit (3) $ 34.7 ____________________ (1) Wendy’s is contingently liable for certain leases and other obligations primarily from Company-owned restaurant locations now operated by franchises amounting to $81.9 million as of January 3, 2010. These leases extend through 2030, including all existing extension or renewal option periods. In addition, Wendy’s is contingently liable for certain leases which have been assigned to unrelated third parties, who have indemnified Wendy’s against future liabilities arising under the leases of $12.2 million. These leases expire on various dates through 2022, including all existing extension or renewal option periods. RTM, one of our subsidiaries, guarantees the lease obligations of 10 RTM restaurants formerly operated by affiliates of RTM as of January 3, 2010 (the “Affiliate Lease Guarantees”). Certain former stockholders of RTM have indemnified us with respect to the Affiliate Lease Guarantees. In addition, RTM remains contingently liable for 12 leases for restaurants sold by RTM prior to the acquisition of RTM in 2005 if the respective purchasers do not make the required lease payments (collectively with the Affiliate Lease Guarantees, the “Lease Guarantees”). The Lease Guarantees, which extend through 2025, including all existing extension or renewal option periods could aggregate a maximum of approximately $14.5 million as of January 3, 2010. (2) Wendy’s provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees under debt arrangements for new store development and equipment financing. Recourse on the majority of these loans is limited, generally to a percentage of the original loan amount or the current loan balance on individual franchisee loans or an aggregate minimum for the entire loan arrangement. (3) Wendy’s/Arby’s, Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants and Wendy’s have outstanding letters of credit of $0.8 million, $33.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, with various parties; however, our management does not expect any material loss to result from these letters of credit because we do not believe performance will be required. Universal Shelf Registration Statement In December 2008, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the possible future offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants to purchase any of these types of securities. This registration statement became effective automatically upon filing. Unless otherwise described in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to any offered securities, we anticipate using the net proceeds of each offering for general corporate purposes, including financing of acquisitions and capital expenditures, additions to working capital and repayment of existing debt. We have not presently made any decision to issue any specific securities under this universal shelf registration statement. Inflation and Changing Prices We believe that inflation did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations during the reporting periods since inflation rates generally remained at relatively low levels. Seasonality Our restaurant operations are moderately impacted by seasonality. Wendy’s restaurant revenues are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months, and Arby’s restaurant revenues are somewhat lower in our first quarter. Because our businesses are moderately seasonal, results for any future quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and assumptions concern, among other things, goodwill impairment, impairment of other long-lived assets, uncertainties for Federal and state income tax, allowance for doubtful accounts, and accounting for leases. We evaluate those estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Table of Contents - 51 - - We believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: · Goodwill impairment: The Company operates in two business segments consisting of restaurant brands: (1) Wendy’s restaurant operations and (2) Arby’s restaurant operations. Each segment includes Company-owned restaurants and franchise reporting units which are considered to be separate reporting units for purposes of measuring goodwill impairment. As of January 3, 2010, substantially all Wendy’s goodwill of $863.4 million relates to the Wendy’s franchise reporting unit. Also, Arby’s goodwill of $17.6 million relates entirely to the Arby’s franchise operations. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired using a two-step process. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and we must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Step two of the impairment test, if necessary, requires the estimation of the fair value for the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit in order to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by management and is based on the results of (1) estimates we made regarding the present value of the anticipated cash flows associated with each reporting unit (the “income approach”) and (2) the indicated value of the reporting units based on a comparison and correlation of the Company and other similar companies (the “market approach”). The income approach which, considers factors unique to each of our reporting units and related long range plans that may not be comparable to other companies and that are not yet publicly available, is dependent on several critical management assumptions. These assumptions include estimates of future sales growth, gross margins, operating costs, income tax rates, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures and the weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). Anticipated cash flows used under the income approach are developed every fourth quarter in conjunction with our annual budgeting process and also incorporate amounts and timing of future cash flows based on our long range plan. The discount rates used in the income approach are an estimate of the rate of return that a market participant would expect of each reporting unit. To select an appropriate rate for discounting the future earnings stream, a review was made of short-term interest rate yields of long-term corporate and government bonds, as well as the typical capital structure of companies in the industry. The discount rates used for each reporting unit may vary depending on the risk inherent in the cash flow projections, as well as the risk level that would be perceived by a market participant. A terminal value is included at the end of the projection period used in our discounted cash flow analyses to reflect the remaining value that each reporting unit is expected to generate. The terminal value represents the present value in the last year of the projection period of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity. The terminal value growth rate is a key assumption used in determining the terminal value as it represents the annual growth of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity Under the market approach, we apply the guideline company method in estimating fair value. The guideline company method makes use of market price data of corporations whose stock is actively traded in a public market. The corporations we selected as guideline companies are engaged in a similar line of business or are subject to similar financial and business risks, including the opportunity for growth. The guideline company method of the market approach provides an indication of value by relating the equity or invested capital (debt plus equity) of guideline companies to various measures of their earnings and cash flow, then applying such multiples to the business being valued. The result of applying the guideline company approach is adjusted based on the incremental value associated with a controlling interest in the business. This “control premium” represents the amount a new controlling shareholder would pay for the benefits resulting from synergies and other potential benefits derived from controlling the enterprise. The estimated fair value of our reporting units are subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we use, we may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future years. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2009. As a result of our testing, we concluded that the fair value of each of the Wendy’s reporting units and Arby’s franchise restaurant reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts. · Impairment of other long-lived assets: Other long-lived assets include our Wendy’s and Arby’s Company-owned restaurants assets and their intangible assets, which include trademarks, franchise agreements, favorable leases and reacquired rights under franchise agreements. Table of Contents - 52 - - As of January 3, 2010, the net carrying value of Wendy’s restaurant segment long-lived assets and intangible assets were $1,177.5 million and $1,342.9 million (which includes $903.0 million associated with Wendy’s non-amortizing trademarks), respectively, and Arby’s restaurant segment long-lived assets and intangible assets were $419.8 million and $32.0 million, respectively. We review long-lived and amortizing intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of property and equipment and finite-lived other intangible assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable in full on an undiscounted cash flow basis, and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is included in “Impairment of the other long-lived assets.” Our critical estimates in this review process include the anticipated future cash flows of each of Arby’s and Wendy’s Company-owned restaurants used in assessing the recoverability of their respective long-lived assets. Non-amortizing intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing their carrying value to fair value; any excess of carrying value over fair value would represent impairment and a corresponding charge would be recorded. Our critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible assets include the anticipated future sales of Company-owned and franchised restaurants and the resulting cash flows. Arby’s restaurants impairment losses reflect impairment charges resulting from the deterioration in operating performance of certain Company-owned restaurants in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Wendy’s restaurants impairment losses also reflect impairment charges resulting from the same factors in 2009. Those estimates are or were subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we used, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future years. · Federal and state income tax uncertainties: We measure income tax uncertainties in accordance with a two-step process of evaluating a tax position. We first determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured, for purposes of financial statement recognition, as the largest amount that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement. With the adoption of this approach, at January 1, 2007 we recognized an increase in our uncertain income tax positions of $4.8 million, an increase in our liability for interest of $0.5 million and an increase in our liability for penalties of $0.2 million related to uncertain income tax positions. These increases were partially offset by an increase in a deferred income tax benefit of $3.2 million. There was also a reduction in the tax related liabilities of discontinued operations of $0.1 million. The net effect of all these adjustments was a decrease in retained earnings of $2.2 million. We have unrecognized tax benefits of $31.0 million and $30.3 million, which if resolved favorably would reduce the Company’s tax expense by $21.8 million and $22.2 million, at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively. We recognize interest accrued related to uncertain tax positions in “Interest expense” and penalties in “General and administrative expenses.” At January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008 we had $4.3 million and $6.2 million accrued for interest and $1.0 million and $1.9 million accrued for penalties, both respectively. As discussed above in “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” our 2010 and 2009 U.S. Federal income tax years are under examination as part of CAP. Our U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2005 to September 29, 2008 are not currently under examination while certain of our state income tax returns and certain of Wendy’s state income tax returns for periods prior to the merger are under examination. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for any liabilities, including interest and penalties that may result from the completion of these examinations. · Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts and notes receivable consist primarily of royalty and franchise fee receivables, credit card receivables and rent. Notes receivable (non-current) consist of the DFR Notes and notes receivable for franchisee obligations. The repayment of the $48.0 million principal amount of DFR Notes due in 2012 received in connection with the Deerfield Sale and the payment of related interest are dependent on the cash flow of DFR, including Deerfield. DFR’s investment portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed income investments, including mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt and its activities also include the asset management business of Deerfield. Among the factors that may affect DFR’s ability to continue to pay the DFR Notes and related interest is the current dislocation in the sub-prime mortgage sector and the continuing weakness in the broader credit market, both of which could continue to adversely affect DFR and one or more of its lenders. These factors, in turn, could result in increases in its borrowing costs, reductions in its liquidity and reductions Table of Contents - 53 - - in the value of DFR’s investments in its portfolio, all of which could reduce their cash flows and could result in an increase to the current allowance for doubtful accounts on DFR Notes of $21.2 million. The need for an allowance for doubtful accounts on franchise obligations is reviewed on a specific franchisee basis based upon past due balances and the financial strength of the franchisee. If average sales or the financial health of franchisees were to deteriorate, it could result in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts related to franchise receivables. In 2009, Arby’s franchisee related accounts receivable and notes receivable and estimated reserves for uncollectibility have increased significantly, and may continue to increase, as a result of the deteriorating financial condition of some of our franchisees. For the year ended January 3, 2010, we recorded $8.2 million in provision for doubtful accounts of which $7.4 million related to the Arby’s franchises. · Accounting for leases We operate restaurants that are located on sites owned by us and sites leased by us from third parties. At inception, each lease is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease based on lease terms. When determining the lease term we include option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic detriment. The primary penalty to which we are subject is the economic detriment associated with the existence of leasehold improvements which might be impaired if we choose not to exercise the available renewal options. For operating leases, minimum lease payments, including minimum scheduled rent increases, are recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis (“Straight-Line Rent”) over the applicable lease terms. Lease terms are generally for 20 years and, in most cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. The term used for Straight-Line Rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the expected lease termination date at lease inception. We expense rent from possession date to the restaurant opening date. There is a period under certain lease agreements referred to as a rent holiday (“Rent Holiday”) that generally begins on the possession date and ends on the rent commencement date. During the Rent Holiday period, no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease, however, expense is recorded for that period consistent with the Straight-Line Rent policy. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the rent payable during the lease term, as determined above, on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease (including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises), and record the excess of the Straight-Line Rent over the minimum rents paid as a deferred lease liability included in “Other liabilities.” Certain leases contain provisions, referred to as contingent rent (“Contingent Rent”), that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume. Contingent rent is expensed each period as the liability is incurred. Favorable and unfavorable lease amounts are recorded as components of “Other intangible assets” and “Other liabilities”, respectively, when we purchase restaurants and are amortized to “Cost of sales” – both on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the leases. When the expected term of a lease, including early terminations, is determined to be shorter than the original amortization period, the favorable or unfavorable lease balance associated with the lease is adjusted to reflect the revised lease term and a gain or loss recognized. Management, with the assistance of a valuation firm, makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding each new lease agreement, lease renewal, and lease amendment, including, but not limited to property values, market rents, property lives, discount rates, and probable term, all of which can impact (1) the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, (2) the rent holiday and/or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent, (3) the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized and (4) the values and lives of favorable and unfavorable leases. These estimates and assumptions may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization, interest and rent expense that would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidelines on the consolidation of variable interest entities which alters how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through voting interests should be consolidated. A company has to determine whether it should provide consolidated reporting of an entity based upon the entity's purpose and design and the parent company's ability to direct the entity's actions. The guidance is effective commencing with our 2010 fiscal year. We do not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued amendments to the existing fair value measurements and disclosures guidance which requires new disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements. The purpose of these amendments is to provide a greater level of disaggregated information as well as more disclosure around valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements. The guidance is effective commencing with our 2010 fiscal year. We do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Table of Contents - 54 - - Item 7A. Quantitativeand Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Certain statements we make under this Item 7A constitute “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections” in “Part I” preceding “Item 1.” We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, changes in commodity prices, changes in the market value of our investments and foreign currency fluctuations primarily related to the Canadian dollar. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these changes using financial instruments we deem appropriate. Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact on our earnings and cash flows. Our policy is to maintain a target, over time and subject to market conditions, of between 50% and 75% of “Long-term debt” as fixed rate debt. As of January 3, 2010 our long-term debt, including current portion and excluding the effect of interest rate swaps discussed below, aggregated $1,522.9 million and consisted of $1,056.3 million of fixed-rate debt, $251.5 million of variable-rate debt, and $215.1 million of capitalized lease and sale-leaseback obligations. Our variable interest rate debt consists of term loan borrowings under a variable-rate senior secured term loan facility due through 2012 (the “Credit Agreement”). The term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement and amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility included in the Credit Agreement bear interest at the borrowers’ option at either (1) LIBOR (0.25% at January 3, 2010) of not less than 2.75% plus an interest rate margin of 4.5% or (2) the higher of a base rate determined by the administrative agent for the Credit Agreement or the Federal funds rate plus 0.5% (but not less than 3.75%), in either case plus an interest rate margin of 3.5%. The Base Rate option was chosen as of January 3, 2010 with a resulting 7.25% interest rate. Consistent with our policy, we entered into several outstanding interest rate swap agreements (the “Interest Rate Swaps”) during the third quarter of 2009 with notional amounts totaling $361.0 million that swap the fixed rate interest rates on our 6.20% and 6.25% Wendy’s senior notes for floating rates. The Interest Rate Swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and qualify for the short-cut method under the applicable guidance. At January 3, 2010, the fair value of our Interest Rate Swaps was $1.6 million and was included in “Deferred costs and other assets” and as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the 6.20% and 6.25% Wendy’s Senior Notes. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. If any portion of the hedge is determined to be ineffective, any changes in fair value would be recognized in our results of operations. Commodity Price Risk In our restaurants segments, we purchase certain food products, such as beef, poultry, pork and cheese, that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to variability in our food costs. While price volatility can occur, which would impact profit margins, there are generally alternative suppliers available. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. Management monitors our exposure to commodity price risk. Arby’s does not enter into financial instruments to hedge commodity prices or hold any significant inventories of these commodities. In order to ensure favorable pricing for its major food products, as well as maintain an adequate supply of fresh food products, we are members of a purchasing cooperative along with our franchisees that negotiates contracts with approved suppliers on behalf of the Arby's system. These contracts establish pricing arrangements, and historically have limited the variability of these commodity costs, but do not establish any firm purchase commitments by us or our franchisees. During 2009, Wendy’s employed various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility. Generally these techniques included setting fixed prices with suppliers generally for one year or less, and setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future by having the supplier enter into forward arrangements (sometimes referred to as “buying forward”).” In 2010, Wendy’s, along with our franchisees, became members of a purchasing cooperative established in the fourth quarter of 2009 that negotiates contracts with approved suppliers on behalf of the Wendy's system in order to ensure favorable pricing for its major food products, as well as maintain an adequate supply of fresh food products. The purchasing contracts which established pricing arrangements, and historically have limited the variability of these commodity costs but do not establish any firm purchase commitments by us or our franchisees, were transferred to the purchasing cooperative in January 2010. Equity Market Risk Our objective in managing our exposure to changes in the market value of our investments is to balance the risk of the impact of these changes on our earnings and cash flows with our expectations for long-term investment returns. Foreign Currency Risk Our primary exposures to foreign currency risk are primarily related to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations. Exposure outside of North America is limited to the effect of rate fluctuations on royalties paid by Table of Contents - 55 - - franchisees. To a more limited extent, we have exposure to foreign currency risk relating to our investments in certain investment limited partnerships and similar investment entities that hold foreign securities and a total return swap with respect to a foreign equity security. We monitor these exposures and periodically determine our need for the use of strategies intended to lessen or limit our exposure to these fluctuations. We have exposure to (1) our investment in a joint venture with Tim Hortons, Inc. (“THI”), (2) investments in a Canadian subsidiary, and (3) export revenues and related receivables denominated in foreign currencies which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Wendy’s is a partner in a Canadian restaurant real estate joint venture with THI (“TimWen”). Wendy’s 50% share of TimWen is accounted for using the Equity Method. Our Canadian subsidiary exposures relate to its restaurants and administrative operations. The exposure to Canadian dollar exchange rates on the Company’s cash flows primarily includes imports paid for by Canadian operations in U.S. dollars and payments from the Company’s Canadian operations to the Company’s U.S. operations in U.S. dollars, and to a lesser extent royalties paid by Canadian franchisees. Revenues from foreign operations for the year ended January 3, 2010 represented 9% of our total franchise revenues and 7% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 28, 2008, the same percentages were 7% and 3%, respectively. Accordingly, an immediate 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the United States dollar from their levels at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008 would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Credit Risk Our credit risk as of January 3, 2010 includes the DFR Notes, which we received in late fiscal 2007 in connection with the sale of our majority capital interest in Deerfield. In 2007, the Company received, as a part of the proceeds of the Deerfield Sale, $48.0 million principal amount of DFR Notes with an estimated fair value of $46.2 million at the date of the Deerfield Sale. The DFR Notes bear interest at the three-month LIBOR (0.25% at January 3, 2010) plus a factor, initially 5% through December 31, 2009, increasing 0.5% each quarter from January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011 and 0.25% each quarter from July 1, 2011 through their maturity. The DFR Notes are secured by certain equity interests of DFR and certain of its subsidiaries. The fair value of the DFR Notes was based on the present value of the probability weighted average of expected cash flows from the DFR Notes. The Company believed that this value approximated the fair value of the DFR Notes as of December 27, 2007 due to the close proximity to the Deerfield Sale date. Due to the significant weakness in the credit markets in 2008 and at DFR and our ongoing assessment of the likelihood of full repayment of the principal amount of the DFR Notes, Company management determined that the probability of collectability of the full principal amount of the DFR Notes was not likely and recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts on the DFR Notes of $21.2 million in 2008. The DFR Notes, net of unamortized discount and the valuation allowance, of $25.7 million and $25.3 million at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively, are included in non-current “Notes receivable.” Overall Market Risk Our overall market risk as of January 3, 2010 includes cash equivalents, certain cost investments and our equity investment in TimWen. As of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, these investments were classified in our consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions): Year End 2009 2008 Cash equivalents included in “Cash and cash equivalents” $ 238.4 $ 36.8 Current restricted cash equivalents 1.1 20.8 Investment related receivables included in “Accounts and notes receivable” 0.1 - Short-term investments included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” 0.3 0.2 Non-current restricted cash equivalents 6.3 34.0 Non-current investments 107.0 133.0 Investment related receivables included in “Deferred costs and other assets” - 0.4 $ 353.2 $ 225.2 Certain liability positions related to investments included in “Other liabilities”: Derivatives in liability positions $ - $ (3.0 ) Securities sold with an obligation to purchase - (16.6 ) $ - $ (19.6 ) Table of Contents - 56 - - Equities Account Prior to 2007, we invested $75.0 million in the Equities Account, which was managed by the Management Company. The Equities Account was invested principally in equity securities, cash equivalents and equity derivatives of a limited number of publicly-traded companies. In addition, the Equities Account sold securities short and invested in market put options in order to lessen the impact of significant market downturns. In June 2009, we and the Management Company entered into the Withdrawal Agreement which provided that we would be permitted to withdraw all amounts in the Early Withdrawal effective no later than June 26, 2009. Prior to the Withdrawal Agreement and as a result of an investment management agreement with the Management Company which was terminated on June 26, 2009, we had not been permitted to withdraw any amounts from the Equities Account until December 31, 2010, although $47.0 million was released from the Equities Account in 2008 subject to an obligation to return that amount to the Equities Account by a specified date. In consideration for obtaining such Early Withdrawal right, we agreed to pay the Management Company $5.5 million, were not required to return the $47.0 million referred to above and were no longer obligated to pay investment management and incentive fees to the Management Company. The Equities Account investments were liquidated in the Equities Sale, of which $31.9 million was received by us, net of the Withdrawal Fee and for which we realized a gain of $2.3 million in the 2009, both included in “Investment expense (income), net.” Our cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired and consisted principally of cash in bank, money market and mutual fund money market accounts, and are primarily not in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured accounts, $7.4 million of which was restricted as of January 3, 2010. At January 3, 2010 our investments were classified in the following general types or categories (in millions): Carrying Value Type At Cost At Fair Value (a) Amount Percent Cash equivalents $ 238.4 $ 238.4 $ 238.4 67.5% Current and non-current restricted cash equivalents 7.4 7.4 7.4 2.1% Investment related receivables 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0% Investment accounted for as an available-for-sale security 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.1% Other non-current investments accounted for at: Equity 89.0 97.5 97.5 27.6% Cost 9.5 11.3 9.5 2.7% $ 344.6 $ 355.0 $ 353.2 100.0% (a) There was no assurance at January 3, 2010 that we would have been able to sell certain of these investments at these amounts.

(b) Includes amounts managed in the Equities Account by the Management Company, described above. Table of Contents - 57 - - Our investments which are accounted for at cost included limited partnerships and other non-current investments in which we do not have significant influence over the investees. Realized gains and losses on our investments recorded at cost are reported as income or loss in the period in which the securities are sold. Investments accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting are those in which we have significant influence over the investees and for which our results of operations include our share of the income or loss of the investees. We review all of our investments in which we have unrealized losses and recognize investment losses currently for any unrealized losses we deem to be other than temporary. Sensitivity Analysis Our estimate of market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instruments held by us at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008 for which an immediate adverse market movement would cause a potential material impact on our financial position or results of operations. We believe that the adverse market movements described below represent the hypothetical loss to our financial position or our results of operations and do not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. As of January 3, 2010, we did not hold any market-risk sensitive instruments which were entered into for trading purposes. As such, the table below reflects the risk for those financial instruments entered into as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008 based upon assumed immediate adverse effects as noted below (in millions): Year End 2009 Carrying Value Interest Rate Risk Equity Price Risk Foreign Currency Risk Cash equivalents $ 238.4 $ - $ - $ - Current and non-current restricted cash equivalents 7.4 - - - Available-for-sale equity security 0.3 - - - Interest Rate Swaps 1.6 (5.6 ) - - Equity investment 97.5 - (9.8 ) (9.8 ) Cost investments 9.5 (0.1 ) (0.8 ) - DFR Notes 25.7 (0.3 ) - - Long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease and sale-leaseback obligations-variable rate (251.5 ) (5.3 ) - - Long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease and sale-leaseback obligations-fixed rate (1,056.3 ) (36.7 ) - - Year End 2008 Carrying Value Interest Rate Risk Equity Price Risk Foreign Currency Risk Cash equivalents $ 36.8 $ - $ - $ (0.4 ) Investment related receivables 0.4 - - - Current and non-current restricted cash equivalents 54.8 - - - Available-for-sale equity securities 0.2 - - - Available-for-sale equity securities – restricted 30.2 - (3.0 ) - Equity investments 90.0 - (9.0 ) (9.0 ) Cost investments 12.8 (0.1 ) (1.2 ) - DFR Notes 25.3 (0.3 ) - - Investments in liability positions: Securities sold with an obligation to purchase - restricted (16.6 ) (0.2 ) (1.7 ) - Total return swap on equity securities – restricted (3.0 ) - (1.5 ) (1.1 ) Long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease and sale-leaseback obligations-variable rate (385.0 ) (11.9 ) - - Long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease and sale-leaseback obligations-fixed rate (495.9 ) (61.0 ) - - Table of Contents - 58 - - The sensitivity analysis of financial instruments held at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008 assumes (1) an instantaneous one percentage point adverse change in market interest rates, (2) an instantaneous 10% adverse change in the equity markets in which we are invested and (3) an instantaneous 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the United States dollar, each from their levels at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively, and with all other variables held constant. The equity price risk reflects the impact of a 10% decrease in the carrying value of our equity securities, including those in “Cost investments” in the tables above. The sensitivity analysis also assumes that the decreases in the equity markets and foreign exchange rates are other than temporary. We have not reduced the equity price risk for available-for-sale investments and cost investments to the extent of unrealized gains on certain of those investments, which would limit or eliminate the effect of the indicated market risk on our results of operations and, for cost investments, our financial position. Our cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents included $238.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively, as of January 3, 2010 of bank money market accounts and interest-bearing brokerage and bank accounts which are all investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired and are designed to maintain a stable value. As of January 3, 2010, we had amounts of both fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt. On the fixed-rate debt, the interest rate risk presented with respect to our long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease and sale-leaseback obligations, primarily relates to the potential impact a decrease in interest rates of one percentage point has on the fair value of our $1,056.3 million of fixed-rate debt and not on our financial position or our results of operations. However, as discussed above under “Interest Rate Risk,” we have interest rate swap agreements on a portion of our fixed-rate debt. The interest rate risk of our fixed-rate debt presented in the tables above exclude the effect of the $361.0 million for which we designated interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges for the terms of the swap agreements. As interest rates decrease, the fair market values of the interest rate swap agreements increase. The interest rate risks presented with respect to the interest rate swap agreements represent the potential impact the indicated change has on our results of operations. On the variable-rate debt, the interest rate risk presented with respect to our long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease and sale-leaseback obligations, represents the potential impact an increase in interest rates of one percentage point has on our results of operations related to our $251.5 million of variable-rate long-term debt outstanding as of January 3, 2010.

62 - - REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. Atlanta, Georgia We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 3, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 3, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 3, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 3, 2010 Table of Contents - 63 - - Item 8.

On September 29, 2008, (the “Closing Date”), we completed the merger (the “Wendy’s Merger”) with Wendy’s International, Inc. (“Wendy’s”) and our corporate name Triarc Companies, Inc. (“Triarc”) was changed to Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. Wendy’s/Arby’s is the parent company of its wholly-owned subsidiary holding company, Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants, LLC (“Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants”). The principal wholly-owned subsidiaries of Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants as of January 3, 2010 are Wendy’s and Arby’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“ARG” or “Arby’s”) and their subsidiaries. Wendy’s and Arby’s are the franchisors of the Wendy’s® and Arby’s® restaurant systems. The Company also has or had a number of other non-operating subsidiaries. Deerfield & Company, LLC (“Deerfield”), an asset management business, was also a principal subsidiary of the Company until it was sold (the “Deerfield Sale”) on December 21, 2007. Nature of operations The Company’s restaurant operations comprise two business segments: Arby’s restaurants and Wendy’s restaurants subsequent to the Wendy’s Merger on September 29, 2008. Prior to the Deerfield Sale, our business operations also included an asset management segment that offered a diverse range of fixed income and credit-related strategies to institutional investors, including Deerfield Capital Corp. (“DFR”) to whom Deerfield was sold. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). As a result of the Wendy’s Merger, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wendy’s subsequent to the Closing Date. The Company participates in three national advertising funds established to collect and administer funds contributed for use in advertising and promotional programs for Company-owned and franchised stores. The revenue, expenses and cash flows of all such advertising funds are not included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the contributions to these advertising funds are designated for specific purposes, and the Company acts as an, in substance, agent with regard to these contributions. The assets and liabilities of these funds are reported as “Advertising funds restricted assets” and “Advertising funds restricted liabilities.” All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Fiscal year Our fiscal reporting periods consist of 53 or 52 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31 and are referred to herein as (1) “the year ended January 3, 2010” or “2009”, which consisted of 53 weeks, (2) “the year ended December 28, 2008” or “2008” and (3) “the year ended December 31, 2007” or “2007” both of which consisted of 52 weeks. Table of Contents - 71 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) Cash equivalents All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired are considered cash equivalents. The Company’s cash equivalents principally consist of cash in bank, money market and mutual fund money market accounts and are primarily not in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured accounts. We believe that our vulnerability to risk concentrations in our cash equivalents is mitigated by (1) our policies restricting the eligibility, credit quality and concentration limits for our placements in cash equivalents and (2) insurance from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation of up to $500 per account as well as supplemental private insurance coverage maintained by substantially all of our brokerage firms, to the extent our cash equivalents are held in brokerage accounts. Accounts and notes receivable Accounts and notes receivable consist primarily of royalty and franchise fee receivables, credit card receivables and rents, principally due from franchisees. Notes receivable (non-current) also includes a note receivable due from DFR (“DFR Notes”) received as proceeds in the Deerfield Sale. The need for an allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a specific identification basis based upon past due balances and the financial strength of the obligor. As a result of holding the DFR Notes received in connection with the Deerfield Sale, the Company has potential vulnerability to risk related to interest from, and the collection of, the DFR Notes. All quarterly cash interest payments due through January 3, 2010 on the DFR Notes have been received on a timely basis. Based on our assessment of the likelihood of the collectability of the full principal amount of the DFR Notes, we have recorded an allowance for collectability of $21,227 on these notes as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008. Inventories The Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined in accordance with the first-in, first-out method, and consist primarily of restaurant food items, kids’ meal toys and paper supplies. Investments Investments include marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values. The Company’s marketable equity securities are classified and accounted for as “available-for-sale” and are reported at fair market value with the resulting net unrealized holding gains or losses, net of income taxes, reported as a separate component of comprehensive income (loss) bypassing net income. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings or losses of securities sold for all marketable securities. Investments in which we have significant influence over the investees (“Equity Investments”), including our 50% share in a partnership in a Canadian restaurant real estate joint venture (“TimWen”) with Tim Hortons Inc. (“THI”), are accounted for in accordance with the “Equity Method” of accounting under which our results of operations include our share of the income or loss of the investees. Investments in limited partnerships and other non-current investments in which we do not have significant influence over the investees are recorded at cost (the “Cost Method”), with related realized gains and losses reported as income or loss in the period in which the securities are sold or otherwise disposed. The difference, if any, between the carrying value of the Company’s Equity Investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of each investee (the “Carrying Value Difference”) is accounted for as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary. Accordingly, the Carrying Value Difference is amortized over the estimated lives of the assets of the investee to which such difference would have been allocated if the Equity Investment were a consolidated subsidiary. To the extent the Carrying Value Difference represents goodwill, it is not amortized. The Company reviews all of its investments with unrealized losses and recognizes investment losses currently for any unrealized losses deemed to be other than temporary (“Other Than Temporary Losses”). These investment losses are recognized as a component of net (loss) income. For investments other than preferred shares of collateralized debt obligation vehicles (“CDOs”) for which the Company acted as collateral manager through the date of the Deerfield Sale, the Company considers such factors as the length of time the market value of an investment has been below its carrying value, the severity of the decline, the financial condition of the investee and the prospect for future recovery in the market value of the investment, including the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery. The cost-basis component of investments represents original cost less a permanent reduction for any unrealized losses that were deemed to be other than temporary. For preferred shares of CDOs, the Company considered, through the date of the Deerfield Sale, whether there had been any adverse change in the estimated cash flows of Table of Contents - 72 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) the investments in the CDOs as well as the prospect for future recovery, including the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery. Securities sold with an obligation to purchase Securities sold with an obligation to purchase are reported at fair market value with the resulting net unrealized gains or losses included as a component of net income or loss. Properties and depreciation and amortization Properties are stated at cost, including internal costs of employees to the extent such employees are dedicated to specific restaurant construction projects, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of properties is computed principally on the straight-line basis using the following estimated useful lives of the related major classes of properties: 1 to 15 years for office and restaurant equipment, 5 to 15 years for transportation equipment, 7 to 30 years for buildings and 7 to 20 years for owned site improvements. Leased assets capitalized and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including periods covered by renewal options that the Company believes it is reasonably assured of exercising. The Company reviews its properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. If such review indicates an asset group may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of an asset group to be held and used or over the fair value less cost to sell of an asset to be disposed. Asset groups are primarily comprised of our individual restaurant properties. Goodwill The Company operates in two business segments consisting of two restaurant brands: (1) Wendy’s restaurant operations and (2) Arby’s restaurant operations. Each segment includes Company-owned restaurants and franchise reporting units which are considered to be separate reporting units for purposes of measuring goodwill impairment. Substantially all goodwill at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008 was associated with our franchise reporting units. Goodwill, representing the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets, is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired, by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit, using both discounted cash flows and market multiples based on earnings, to the carrying value to determine if there is an indication that a potential impairment may exist. If we determine that an impairment may exist, we then measure the amount of the impairment loss as the excess, if any, of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its implied fair value. In determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Our fair value estimates are subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we use, we may be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges in future years. Other intangible assets and deferred costs Amortizing intangible assets are amortized on the straight-line basis using the following estimated useful lives of the related classes of intangibles: the terms of the respective leases, including periods covered by renewal options that the Company is reasonably assured of exercising, for favorable leases; 19 to 21 years for franchise agreements; 1 to 5 years for costs of computer software; 20 years for reacquired rights under franchise agreements; 20 years for trademarks with a definite life and distribution rights; and 3 to 8 years for non-compete agreements. Trademarks acquired in the Wendy’s Merger have an indefinite life and are not amortized. Asset management contracts, through the date of the Deerfield Sale, were amortized on the straight-line basis over their estimated lives of 5 to 27 years for CDO contracts and 15 years for contracts under which the company managed investment funds (the “Funds”). The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite lived intangible assets are also reviewed for impairment annually. If such review indicates the intangible asset may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the intangible asset. Table of Contents - 73 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) Deferred financing costs are amortized as interest expense over the lives of the respective debt using the interest rate method. Derivative instruments The Company’s derivative instruments, excluding those that may be settled in its own stock, are recorded at fair value (the “Company’s Derivative Instruments”). Changes in fair value of the Company’s Derivative Instruments that have been designated as fair value hedging instruments are recorded as an adjustment to the underlying debt balance being hedged to the extent of the effectiveness of such hedging instruments. Changes in fair value of the Company’s Derivative Instruments that have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments are included in the “Unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges” component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” to the extent of the effectiveness of such hedging instruments. Any ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the designated hedging instruments is included in results of operations. Share-Based Compensation The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures, determined based on historical experience. The Company uses (1) the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model (the “Black-Scholes Model”) for purposes of determining the fair value of stock options granted and (2) recognizes compensation costs ratably over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. Foreign currency translation At January 3, 2010, substantially all of the Company’s foreign operations were in Canada where the functional currency is the Canadian dollar. Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are prepared in their functional currency then translated into United States dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date and revenues, costs, and expenses are translated at a monthly average exchange rate. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation adjustment are charged or credited directly to the “Foreign currency translation adjustment” component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Income taxes We record income tax liabilities based on known obligations and estimates of potential obligations. A deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. When considered necessary, we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not all or a portion of the asset will not be realized. We apply a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns (“Uncertain Tax Positions”). A two-step process of evaluating a tax position is followed, whereby we first determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured for purposes of financial statement recognition as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon being effectively settled. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance related to Uncertain Tax Positions on January 1, 2007. As a result of adoption, the Company recorded a reduction of retained earnings of $2,275 as of the beginning of 2007. Interest accrued for Uncertain Tax Positions is charged to “Interest expense.” Penalties accrued for Uncertain Tax Positions are charged to “General and administrative.” Wendy’s/Arby’s files a consolidated Federal income tax return, which includes its principal corporate subsidiaries. As a result of the Wendy’s Merger, which for tax purposes was treated as a reverse acquisition, Wendy’s/Arby’s became part of the Wendy’s consolidated group with Wendy’s/Arby’s as its new parent. As a result, Wendy’s/Arby’s had a short taxable year in 2008 ending on the date of the Wendy’s Merger. Table of Contents - 74 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) Revenue recognition “Sales” includes revenues recognized upon delivery of food to the customer at company-owned restaurants, and revenues for shipments of bakery items and kid’s meal promotional items to our franchisees and others. “Sales” excludes sales taxes collected from the Company’s customers. “Franchise revenues” include royalties, franchise fees, and rental income. Royalties from franchised restaurants are based on a percentage of net sales of the franchised restaurant and are recognized as earned. Initial franchise fees are recorded as deferred income when received and are recognized as revenue when a franchised restaurant is opened since all material services and conditions related to the franchise fee have been substantially performed by the Company upon the restaurant opening. Renewal franchise fees are recognized as revenue when the license agreements are signed and the fee is paid since there are no material services and conditions related to the renewal franchise fee. Franchise commitment fee deposits are forfeited and recognized as revenue upon the termination of the related commitments to open new franchised restaurants. Rental income from locations owned by the Company and leased to franchisees is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective operating lease terms. Asset management and related fees, earned prior to the Deerfield Sale, consisted of the following types of revenues: (1) management fees, (2) incentive fees and (3) other related fees. Management fees were recognized as revenue when the management services had been performed for the period and sufficient cash flows had been generated by the CDOs to pay the fees under the terms of the related management agreements. In addition, the Company recognized non-cash management fee revenue related to its restricted stock and stock options in DFR based on their then current fair values which were amortized from deferred income to revenues over the vesting period. Incentive fees were based upon the performance of the Funds and CDOs and were recognized as revenues when the amounts became fixed and determinable upon the close of a performance period for the Funds and all contingencies were resolved. Other related fees primarily included structuring and warehousing fees earned by the Company for services provided to CDOs and were recognized as revenues upon the rendering of such services and the closing of the respective CDO. Vendor incentives The Company receives incentives from its vendors. These incentives are recognized as earned and are generally classified as a reduction of “Cost of Sales.” Advertising costs The Company incurs various advertising costs, including contributions to certain advertising cooperatives based upon a percentage of net sales by Company-owned restaurants. All advertising costs are expensed as incurred, with the exception of media development costs that are expensed beginning in the month that the advertisement is first communicated, and are included in “Cost of sales”. Self- insurance We are self-insured for most domestic workers’ compensation, health care claims, general liability and automotive liability losses. We provide for our estimated cost to settle both known claims and claims incurred but not yet reported. Liabilities associated with these claims are estimated, in part, by considering the frequency and severity of historical claims, both specific to us as well as industry-wide loss experience, and other actuarial assumptions. We determine casualty insurance obligations with the assistance of actuarial firms. Since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in recording insurance liabilities, and in the case of workers’ compensation, a significant period of time before ultimate resolution of claims, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities. Leases We operate restaurants that are located on sites owned by us and sites leased by us from third parties. At inception, each lease is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease based on lease terms. When determining the lease term, we include option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a significant economic detriment. The primary penalty to which we may be subject is the economic detriment associated with the existence of unamortized leasehold improvements which might be impaired if we choose not to exercise the available renewal options. For operating leases, minimum lease payments, including minimum scheduled rent increases, are recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis (“Straight-Line Rent”) over the applicable lease terms. Lease terms are generally for 20 years and, in most cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. The term used for Straight-Line Rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the expected lease termination date at lease inception. We expense rent from possession date to the restaurant opening date. There is a period under certain lease agreements referred to as a rent holiday (“Rent Holiday”) that generally begins on the possession date and ends on the rent commencement date. During the Rent Holiday period, no cash rent Table of Contents - 75 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) payments are typically due under the terms of the lease, however, expense is recorded for that period on a straight line basis consistent with the Straight-Line Rent policy. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the rent payable during the lease term, as determined above, on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease (including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises), and record the excess of the Straight-Line Rent over the minimum rents paid as a deferred lease liability included in “Other liabilities.” Certain leases contain provisions, referred to as contingent rent (“Contingent Rent”), that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume. Contingent rent is expensed each period as the liability is incurred. Favorable and unfavorable lease amounts, when we purchase restaurants, are recorded as components of “Other intangible assets” and “Other liabilities”, respectively, and are amortized to “Cost of sales” – both on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the leases. When the expected term of a lease, including early terminations, is determined to be shorter than the original amortization period, the favorable or unfavorable lease balance associated with the lease is adjusted to reflect the revised lease term and a gain or loss recognized. Management, with the assistance of a valuation firm, makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding each new lease agreement, lease renewal, and lease amendment, including, but not limited to property values, market rents, property lives, discount rates, and probable term, all of which can impact (1) the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, (2) the rent holiday and/or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent, (3) the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized and (4) the values and lives of favorable and unfavorable leases. Different amounts of depreciation and amortization, interest and rent expense would be reported if different estimates and assumptions were used. Non-controlling Interests The Company adopted new accounting guidance related to non-controlling interests (formerly referred to as minority interests) on the first day of fiscal 2009. This adoption resulted in the retrospective reclassification of minority interests from its former presentation as a liability to “Stockholders’ equity.” As our non-controlling interests are no longer significant ($25, $154 and $958 at the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively), such amounts have not been separately disclosed within “Stockholders’ equity” but rather included in “Additional paid in capital.” Further, net loss attributable to non-controlling interests ($28, $340 and $2,682 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively) are insignificant for all periods presented and therefore have not been separately disclosed but rather included in “Other income (expense), net.” Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidelines on the consolidation of variable interest entities which alters how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through voting interests should be consolidated. A company has to determine whether it should provide consolidated reporting of an entity based upon the entity's purpose and design and the parent company's ability to direct the entity's actions. The guidance is effective commencing with our 2010 fiscal year. We do not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued amendments to the existing fair value measurements and disclosures guidance which requires new disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements. The purpose of these amendments is to provide a greater level of disaggregated information as well as more disclosure around valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements. The guidance is effective commencing with our 2010 fiscal year. We do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. (2) Acquisitions and Dispositions Merger with Wendy’s International, Inc. On September 29, 2008, we completed the Wendy’s Merger in an all-stock transaction in which Wendy’s shareholders received a fixed ratio of 4.25 shares of Wendy’s/Arby’s Class A Common Stock for each share of Wendy’s common stock owned. At September 28, 2008, there were 6,625 Wendy’s restaurants in operation in the United States and in 21 other countries and U.S. territories. Of these restaurants, 1,404 were operated by Wendy’s and 5,221 by Wendy’s franchisees. The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and we concluded that we were the acquirer for financial accounting purposes. The total merger consideration was allocated to Wendy’s net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values with the excess recognized as goodwill of which $42,282 is deductible for tax purposes. The total consideration includes merger related costs in accordance with the applicable guidance effective as of the Closing Date. The computation of the total merger consideration and the allocation of the consideration to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired Table of Contents - 76 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) and liabilities assumed was finalized during the year ended January 3, 2010 and is presented in the table below: Value of shares of Wendy’s/Arby’s common stock issued in exchange for Wendy’s common shares $ 2,476,197 Value of Wendy’s stock options converted into Wendy’s/Arby’s options 18,296 Wendy’s Merger costs 21,028 Total merger consideration 2,515,521 Net book value of Wendy’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed 712,794 Excess of merger consideration over net book value of Wendy’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed 1,802,727 Changes to fair values of assets and liabilities and deferred income tax liability related to the merger: (Increase)/decrease in: Current assets Accounts and notes receivable (694 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 985 Investments (64,852 ) Properties (46,527 ) Other intangible assets Trademark (900,109 ) Franchise agreements (353,000 ) Favorable leases (121,620 ) Computer software 9,572 Deferred costs and other assets (377 ) Increase/(decrease) in: Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 1,956 Long-term debt, including current portion of $228 (56,337 ) Other liabilities (31,378 ) Unfavorable leases 70,762 Deferred income tax liability 552,718 Total adjustments (938,901 ) Total goodwill $ 863,826 In the Wendy’s Merger, 376,776 shares of Wendy’s/Arby’s Class A Common Stock were issued to Wendy’s shareholders. The equity consideration was based on the 4.25 conversion factor of the Wendy’s outstanding shares at a value of $6.57 per share which represented the average closing market price of Triarc Class A Common Stock two days before and after the merger announcement date of April 24, 2008. Immediately prior to the Wendy’s Merger, each share of our Class B Common Stock was converted into Class A common stock on a one for one basis (the “Conversion”). In connection with the May 28, 2009 amendment and restatement of our Certificate of Incorporation, our former Class A common stock is now referred to as “Common Stock.” Outstanding Wendy’s stock options were converted upon completion of the merger into stock options with respect to Wendy’s/Arby’s common stock, based on the 4.25:1 exchange ratio. The value of Wendy’s stock options that have been converted into Wendy’s/Arby’s stock options of $18,296 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of April 24, 2008. The acquired franchise agreements have a weighted average amortization period of approximately 21 years and the acquired trademark has an indefinite life so there is no related amortization. The acquired favorable and unfavorable leases have a weighted average amortization period of approximately 19 and 16 years, respectively. Table of Contents - 77 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) The following unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated summary operating data (the “As Adjusted”) for 2008 and 2007 has been prepared by adjusting the historical data as set forth in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 to give effect to the Wendy’s Merger and the Conversion as if they had been consummated as of the beginning of 2007: 2008 2007 As Reported As Adjusted As Reported As Adjusted Revenues: Sales $ 1,662,291 $ 3,279,504 $ 1,113,436 $ 3,273,461 Franchise revenues 160,470 383,137 86,981 374,950 Asset management and related fees - - 63,300 - Total revenues 1,822,761 3,662,641 1,263,717 3,648,411 Operating (loss) profit (413,650 ) (392,854 ) 19,900 150,437 Net (loss) income (479,741 ) (492,026 ) 16,081 80,856 Basic and diluted (loss) income per share: Common Stock (3.05 ) (1.05 ) .16 .17 Class B Common Stock (1.24 ) N/A .18 N/A This unaudited pro forma information is provided for informational purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the merger had been completed on the date set forth above, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results of the combined company. The As Reported and As Adjusted amounts for Wendy’s include (1) the effect of $84,231 of Special Committee costs incurred before the date of the Wendy’s Merger in 2008 and $24,670 in 2007, (2) $9,757 of facilities relocation costs in 2007, and (3) $6,750 of impairment of other long-lived assets in 2007. The As Adjusted (loss) income per share data for 2008 and 2007 assume the conversion of all Class B Common Stock to Common Stock occurred prior to 2007 and the As Adjusted data for 2007 excludes Deerfield. Other Restaurant Acquisitions and Dispositions The Company completed the acquisitions of the operating assets, net of liabilities assumed, of 45 Arby’s franchised restaurants, including 41 restaurants in the California market, in two separate transactions during fiscal 2008. The total net consideration for acquisitions, including deal costs, was $15,861 consisting of (1) $9,622 of cash and (2) the assumption of $6,239 of debt. During the year ended January 3, 2010, the Company received proceeds from dispositions of $10,882 consisting of $5,045 from the sale of twelve Wendy’s units to a franchisee, $4,529 from the sale of surplus properties and $1,308 related to other dispositions. These sales resulted in a net gain of $1,203 which is included in “Depreciation and amortization.” Other restaurant acquisitions and dispositions during the periods presented were not significant. Sale of Deerfield Prior to 2007, the Company purchased 1,000 shares of DFR for $15,000, and certain former officers (the “DFR Stock Purchasers”) purchased 115 shares of DFR for a cost of $1,731. Such shares were all purchased at the same price and terms as those shares purchased by third-party investors pursuant to an initial public offering of DFR prior to 2007. Subsequently, certain of DFR Stock Purchasers, but not the Company, acquired additional shares at various prices in open-market transactions. The Company, through the date of the Deerfield Sale, was the investment manager of DFR and, subsequent to the Deerfield Sale, maintains one seat on its Board of Directors. Prior to 2007, the Company received restricted investments consisting of 404 of DFR restricted shares (“DFR Restricted Shares”) and options to purchase an additional 1,346 shares of stock of DFR, which represented compensation granted in consideration of the Company’s management of DFR. The restricted stock and options vested one-third each in 2005 through 2007. In addition, during 2007 the Company received 21 shares of common stock of DFR. In March 2007, the Company granted an aggregate 97 of the vested DFR Restricted Shares owned by the Company as restricted stock to additional then employees of the Company. The shares vest ratably over a three-year period. In connection with the March 2007 award, the Company recorded the $1,500 fair market value of DFR shares as of the date of grant as “Deferred costs and other assets.” With the exception of the March 2007 grant of the vested DFR Restricted Shares to employees, all of the DFR Restricted Shares were distributed to the members of Deerfield immediately prior to the Deerfield Sale. In December 2007, pursuant to agreements with certain former executives, the Company distributed its original investment in the 1,000 shares of common stock of DFR to the former executives. In connection with this distribution, the Company realized a $2,872 loss on its investment in DFR common shares which is included in “Other income (expense), net.” On December 21, 2007, the Company sold its 63.6% capital interest in Deerfield to DFR. The Deerfield Sale resulted in non-cash proceeds to the Company aggregating approximately $134,608 consisting of (1) 9,629 preferred shares (the “Preferred Stock”) of a subsidiary of DFR with a then estimated fair value of $88,398 at the time of the Deerfield sale and (2) $47,986 principal amount of Table of Contents - 78 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) series A Senior Secured Notes of DFR due in December 2012 with an estimated fair value of $46,210 at the date of the Deerfield Sale. The Deerfield Sale resulted in an approximate pretax gain of $40,193, net of approximately $2,320 of related fees and expenses and net of the then remaining $6,945 unrecognized gain on the sale which could not be recognized due to the Company’s then continuing interest in DFR, as further described below, and is included in “Gain on sale of consolidated businesses.” The gain at the date of sale excluded approximately $7,651 that the Company could not recognize because of its then approximate 16% continuing interest in DFR through its ownership in the Preferred Stock, on an as-if converted basis, and common stock of DFR it already owned. As a result of a subsequent distribution of 1,000 DFR shares previously owned by the Company in 2007, our ownership decreased to approximately 15% and the Company recognized approximately $706 of the originally deferred gain. The fees and expenses include approximately $825 representing a portion of the additional fees which are attributable to the Company’s utilization of personnel from a management company formed by our Chairman, who is our former Chief Executive Officer, and our Vice Chairman, who is our former President and Chief Operating Officer, and a director, who is our former Vice Chairman (the “Management Company”) in connection with the provision of services under a two-year transition services agreement (the “Services Agreement”). The remaining aggregate 206 unrestricted DFR common shares, representing the portion of the DFR Restricted Shares and other common stock of DFR distributed to us in connection with the Deerfield Sale, and the Preferred Stock received in connection with the Deerfield Sale held by the Company represented an ownership percentage in DFR of 14.7% as of December 30, 2007, on an as-if fully converted basis. Certain former officers of Wendy’s/Arby’s had an approximate 1.5% ownership interest in DFR as of December 30, 2007. We accounted for the DFR Preferred Stock as an available-for-sale debt security due to their mandatory redemption requirement. On March 11, 2008, DFR stockholders approved the one-for-one conversion of all its outstanding convertible preferred stock into DFR common stock which converted the Preferred Stock we held into a like number of shares of common stock. On March 11, 2008, our Board of Directors approved the distribution of our 9,835 shares of DFR common stock, which also included the 206 common shares of DFR distributed to us in connection with the Deerfield Sale to our stockholders. The distribution in the form of a dividend, which was valued at $14,464, was paid in 2008 to holders of record of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock. In March 2008, in response to unanticipated credit and liquidity events in the first quarter of 2008, DFR announced that it was repositioning its investment portfolio to focus on agency-only residential mortgage-backed securities and away from its principal investing segment to its asset management segment with its fee-based revenue streams. In addition, it stated that during the first quarter of 2008, its portfolio was adversely impacted by deterioration of the global credit markets and, as a result, it sold $2,800,000 of its agency and $1,300,000 of its AAA-rated non-agency mortgage-backed securities and reduced the net notional amount of interest rate swaps used to hedge a portion of its mortgage-backed securities by $4,200,000, all at a net after-tax loss of $294,300 to DFR. Based on the events described above and their negative effect on the market price of DFR common stock, we concluded that the fair value and, therefore, the carrying value of our investment in the 9,629 common shares owned by us, as well as the 206 common shares which were distributed to us in connection with the Deerfield Sale, was impaired. As a result, as of March 11, 2008 we recorded an other than temporary loss which is included in “Other than temporary losses on investments” for the year ended December 28, 2008 of $67,594 (without tax benefit as described below) which included $11,074 of pre-tax unrealized holding losses previously recorded as of December 30, 2007 and which were included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” These common shares were considered available-for-sale securities due to the limited period they were to be held as of March 11, 2008 (the “Determination Date”) before the dividend distribution of the shares to our stockholders. We also recorded an additional impairment charge, which is also included in “Other than temporary loses on investments” from March 11, 2008 through the March 29, 2008 record date of the dividend of $492. As a result of the distribution, the income tax loss that resulted from the decline in value of our investment of $68,086 is not deductible for income tax purposes and no income tax benefit was recorded related to this loss. Additionally, from December 31, 2007 through the Determination Date, we recorded approximately $754 of equity in net losses of DFR which are included in “Other income (expense), net” for the year ended December 28, 2008 related to our investment in the 206 common shares of DFR discussed above which were accounted for under the equity method through the Determination Date. (3) DFR Notes On December 21, 2007 the Company received, as a part of the proceeds in the Deerfield Sale, $47,986 principal amount of the DFR Notes with an estimated fair value of $46,210 at the date of the Deerfield Sale. The fair value of the DFR Notes was based on the present value of the probability weighted average of expected cash flows from the DFR Notes. The Company believed that this value approximated the fair value of the DFR Notes as of December 27, 2007 due to the close proximity to the Deerfield Sale date. The DFR Notes bear interest at the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (0.25% at January 3, 2010) plus a factor, initially 5% through December 31, 2009, increasing 0.5% each quarter from January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011 and 0.25% Table of Contents - 79 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) each quarter from July 1, 2011 through their maturity. The DFR Notes are secured by certain equity interests of DFR and certain of its subsidiaries. The $1,776 original imputed discount on the DFR Notes is being accreted to “Other income (expense), net” using the interest rate method. We have received timely cash payment of all quarterly interest payments due on the DFR Notes to date. Additionally, in October 2008 we received a $1,070 dividend payment on the DFR convertible preferred stock which we previously held. Based on the receipt of these payments, we did not record a reserve on these notes prior to the fourth quarter of 2008. The dislocation in the sub-prime mortgage sector and continuing weakness in the broader credit markets has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, DFR’s cash flows. Due to the significant continuing weakness in the credit markets and at DFR and based upon current publicly available information, and our ongoing assessment of the likelihood of full repayment of the principal amount of the DFR Notes, Company management determined that the likelihood of collectability of the full principal amount of the DFR Notes had significantly declined and the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts on the DFR Notes of $21,227 in the fourth quarter of 2008. The 2008 charge is included in “Other than temporary losses on investments.” The Company believes such allowance continues to be necessary at January 3, 2010. The DFR Notes, net of unamortized discount and the valuation allowance, of $25,696 and $25,344 at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively, are included in non-current “Notes receivable.” (4) Income (Loss) Per Share Basic income per share for 2009 is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Prior to the Wendy’s Merger, the Company had Class B common stock which was converted to Class A common stock and is now referred to as “Common Stock” as discussed in Note 2. Basic income (loss) per share for 2008 and 2007 has been computed by dividing the allocated loss or income for the Company’s Common Stock and the Company’s Class B Common Stock by the weighted average number of shares of each class. Net income for 2007 was allocated between our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock based on the actual dividend payment ratio. Net loss for 2008 was allocated equally among each share of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock up until the date of the Conversion; subsequent to the Conversion, net loss was only allocated to our Common Stock since Class B Common Stock no longer existed. Diluted income per share for 2009 and 2007 has been computed by dividing income for our Common Stock and, in 2007, our Class B Common Stock by the weighted average number of shares of each class outstanding plus the potential common share effect of dilutive stock options and of restricted shares, computed using the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for 2008 was the same as basic loss per share for each share since the Company reported a net loss and, therefore, the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on the net loss per share would have been antidilutive. The shares used to calculate diluted income per share exclude any effect of the Company’s 5% convertible notes due 2023 (the “Convertible Notes”) which would have been antidilutive since the after-tax interest on the Convertible Notes per share obtainable on conversion exceeded the reported basic income from continuing operations per share. For 2009 and 2007, we excluded 17,194 and 2,722 potential common shares, respectively, from our diluted per share calculation as they would have had anti-dilutive effects. As of January 3, 2010, our potential common shares consisted of the following: (1) outstanding stock options which can be exercised into 23,465 shares of our Common Stock, (2) 1,481 restricted shares of our Common Stock and (3) $2,100 of Convertible Notes which are convertible into 160 shares of our Common Stock. Income (loss) per share in 2008 and 2007 has been computed by allocating the loss or income as follows: 2008 2007 Common Stock: Continuing operations $ (421,599 ) $ 4,337 Discontinued operations 1,378 286 Net (loss) income $ (420,221 ) $ 4,623 Class B Common Stock: Continuing operations $ (60,359 ) $ 10,749 Discontinued operations 839 709 Net (loss) income $ (59,520 ) $ 11,458 Table of Contents - 80 - - WENDY’S/ARBY’S GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED (In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts) The number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted income (loss) per share was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Common Stock: Basic shares – weighted average shares outstanding 466,204 137,669 28,836 Dilutive effect of stock options and restricted shares 483 - 129 Diluted shares 466,687 137,669 28,965 Class B Common Stock: Basic shares – weighted average shares outstanding 47,965 (a) 63,523 Dilutive effect of stock options and restricted shares - 759 Diluted shares 47,965 64,282 _____________ (a) Represents the weighted average for the full year even though the Class B Common Stock was converted into Common Stock on September 29, 2008.
