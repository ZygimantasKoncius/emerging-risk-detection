ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY We are an early stage company with a history of net losses, and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We have incurred substantial net losses since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred net losses of $27.3 million. From our inception in August 2000 through December 31, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of $152.4 million. To date, we have not, and we may never, achieve revenues sufficient to offset expenses. We expect to devote substantially all of our resources to continue commercializing and enhancing our existing test, Oncotype DX, and to develop future tests. We expect to incur additional losses in the future and we may never achieve profitability. We do not expect our losses to be substantially mitigated by revenues from Oncotype DX or future products, if any, for at least the next year. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses, which may make it difficult for us to achieve profitability. In recent years, we have incurred significant costs in connection with the development of Oncotype DX. Our research and development expenses were $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. We expect our research and development expense levels to remain high and to continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we seek to expand the clinical utility of our existing test and develop new tests. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve profitability. Our failure to achieve profitability in the future could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. If third-party payors, including managed care organizations and Medicare, do not provide reimbursement or rescind their reimbursement policies for Oncotype DX, its commercial success could be compromised. Oncotype DX has a current list price of $3,650. Physicians and patients may decide not to order Oncotype DX unless third-party payors, such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay a substantial portion of the test price. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payors determination that tests using our technologies are:  not experimental or investigational,  medically necessary,  appropriate for the specific patient,  cost-effective,  supported by peer-reviewed publications, and  included in clinical practice guidelines. There is significant uncertainty concerning third-party reimbursement of any test incorporating new technology, including Oncotype DX. Several entities conduct technology assessments of new medical tests and devices and provide the results of their assessments for informational purposes to other parties. These assessments may be used by third-party payors and health care providers as grounds to deny coverage for a test or procedure. Oncotype DX has in the past received negative assessments and may receive additional negative assessments in the future. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy to reimburse our test, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. To date, we have secured policy-level reimbursement approval from a number of third-party payors. We cannot be certain that coverage for Oncotype DX will be provided in the future by additional third-party payors or that existing reimbursement policies will remain in place in the future. In January 2006, NHIC, the local Medicare carrier for California with jurisdiction for claims submitted by us for Medicare patients, released a local coverage determination providing coverage for Oncotype DX when used in 27 Table of Contents accordance with the terms of the determination. As a result, we are permitted to submit claims to Medicare for the Oncotype DX tests performed on Medicare beneficiaries who were hospital inpatients or outpatients at the time the tumor tissue samples were obtained, but only if the test was ordered at least 14 days following the date of the patients discharge from the hospital and where other specified conditions are met. The local coverage determination is effective for Oncotype DX tests provided on or after February 27, 2006. Under Medicare billing rules, claims for Oncotype DX tests performed on Medicare beneficiaries who were hospital inpatients at the time the tumor tissue samples were obtained or when the test is ordered less than 14 days from discharge must be incorporated in the payment that the hospital receives for the inpatient services provided related to the patients breast cancer. Medicare billing rules also require hospitals to bill for the test when performed or ordered for hospital outpatients less than 14 days following the date of the hospital outpatient procedure where the tumor tissue samples were obtained. We are in the process of making arrangements with hospitals for payment of the test when performed for the portion of Medicare beneficiaries, representing approximately 2-3% of our total testing population, who are hospital inpatients or outpatients at the time specimens are collected and who do not meet criteria under the Medicare billing rules for billing by us. We are also working with Medicare to revise or reverse these billing rules to allow us to bill for tests performed after discharge from the hospital. However, we have no assurance that Medicare will revise or reverse these billing rules, and we also cannot ensure that hospitals will agree to arrangements to pay us for tests performed on patients falling under these billing rules. Insurers, including managed care organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. From time to time, Congress has considered and implemented changes in the Medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. Further reductions of reimbursement for Medicare services may be implemented from time to time. Reductions in the reimbursement rates of other third-party payors have occurred and may occur in the future. These measures have resulted in reduced prices and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry. We recently conducted clinical studies to support the use of Oncotype DX in post-menopausal women with N+, ER+ breast cancer. Most of our existing reimbursement coverage is specifically for women with early stage N−, ER+ breast cancer. We may not be able to obtain reimbursement coverage for Oncotype DX for post-menopausal female breast cancer patients who are N+, ER+ patients that is similar to the coverage we have obtained for early stage N−, ER+ patients. If we are unable to obtain reimbursement approval from private payors and Medicare and Medicaid programs for Oncotype DX, or if the amount reimbursed is inadequate, our ability to generate revenues from Oncotype DX could be limited. Even if we are being reimbursed, insurers may withdraw their coverage policies or cancel their contracts with us at any time or stop paying for our test, which would reduce our revenue. We depend on a limited number of payors for a significant portion of our product revenues and if these payors stop providing reimbursement or decrease the amount of reimbursement for our test, our revenues could decline. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, one payor, Medicare, as administered by NHIC, accounted for 23% and 47%, respectively, of our product revenues. Another payor, United HealthCare Insurance Company, accounted for 13% of our product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. NHIC is the local Medicare carrier for California with jurisdiction for claims submitted by us for Medicare patients in the United States. The responsibility for processing Medicare claims submitted by us is being transitioned from NHIC to another entity, Palmetto, which is expected to take over full responsibility for processing such claims by us by summer 2008. We cannot assure you that this new Medicare administrative contractor will adopt the same coverage or payment policies as those adopted by NHIC. In addition, payors that currently provide reimbursement for our test may suspend, revoke or discontinue coverage at any time, or may reduce the reimbursement rates payable to us. Any such changes could have a negative impact on our revenues. 28 Table of Contents If FDA were to begin regulating our test, we could be forced to stop sales of Oncotype DX, we could experience significant delays in commercializing any future products, we could incur substantial costs and time delays associated with meeting requirements for pre-market clearance or approval or we could experience decreased demand for or reimbursement of our test. Clinical laboratory tests like Oncotype DX are regulated under CLIA, as administered through CMS, as well as by applicable state laws. Diagnostic kits that are sold and distributed through interstate commerce are regulated as medical devices by FDA. Clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use are called laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. Most LDTs currently are not subject to FDA regulation, although reagents or software provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation. We believe that Oncotype DX is not a diagnostic kit and also believe that it is an LDT. As a result, we believe Oncotype DX should not be subject to regulation under established FDA policies. The container we provide for collection and transport of tumor samples from a pathology laboratory to our laboratory may be a medical device subject to FDA regulation but is currently exempt from pre-market review by FDA. In January 2006, we received a letter from FDA regarding Oncotype DX inviting us to meet with FDA to discuss the nature and appropriate regulatory status of and the least burdensome ways that we may fulfill any FDA pre-market review requirements that may apply. In September 2006, FDA issued draft guidance on a new class of tests called In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays, or IVDMIAs. Under this draft guidance, Oncotype DX could be classified as either a Class II or a Class III medical device, which may require varying levels of FDA pre-market review depending upon intended use and on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the test. In July 2007, FDA posted revised draft guidance that addressed some of the comments submitted in response to the September 2006 draft guidance. The revised draft guidance includes an 18 month transition period of FDA enforcement discretion following release of final guidance for currently available tests if the laboratory submits a pre-market review submission within 12 months of the publication of final guidance. The comment period for this revised guidance expired in October 2007. In May 2007, FDA issued a guidance document Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Gene Expression Profiling Test System for Breast Cancer Prognosis. This guidance document was developed to support the classification of gene expression profiling test systems for breast cancer prognosis into Class II. In addition, in June 2007, FDA issued a guidance document Pharmacogenetic Tests and Genetic Tests for Heritable Markers which provides recommendations to sponsors and FDA reviewers in preparing and reviewing pre-market approval applications, or PMA, and pre-market notification, or 510(k), submissions for pharmacogenetic and other human genetic tests, whether testing is for single markers or for multiple markers simultaneously (multiplex tests). In addition, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has requested that its Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society make recommendations about the oversight of genetic testing. Draft recommendations were published in November 2007 and were open for public comment through late December 2007, and a final report is expected in the spring of 2008. We are continuing our ongoing dialogue with FDA and HHS regarding the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay. We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including pre-market review, will not be required in the future for Oncotype DX, either through new enforcement policies adopted by FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. It is possible that legislation will be enacted into law and may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to continue to offer the Oncotype DX assay. If pre-market review is required, our business could be negatively impacted until such review is completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained, and FDA could require that we stop selling our test pending pre-market clearance or approval. If our test is allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about our test or if it is labeled investigational by FDA, orders or reimbursement may decline. The regulatory approval process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and submitting a pre-market clearance notice or filing a PMA application with FDA. If pre-market review is required by FDA, there can be no assurance that our test will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to inspection by FDA and to the 29 Table of Contents requirements of FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA pre-market review of Oncotype DX if we determine that doing so would be appropriate. Should any of the reagents obtained by us from vendors and used in conducting our test be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of testing or delaying, limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform testing. If we were required to conduct additional clinical trials prior to continuing to sell Oncotype DX or marketing any new test, those trials could lead to delays or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and harm our ability to become profitable. If FDA decides to regulate our tests, it may require extensive pre-market clinical testing prior to submitting a regulatory application for commercial sales. If we are required to conduct pre-market clinical trials, whether using prospectively acquired samples or archival samples, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly increase our test development costs and delay commercialization. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. We may find it necessary to engage contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials, which might increase the cost and complexity of our trials. We may also depend on clinical investigators, medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform the trials properly. If these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may have to be extended, delayed or terminated. Many of these factors would be beyond our control. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable expenditures. If there are delays in testing or approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third parties, our research and development costs would increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our test. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at all. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our test, or to become profitable. Complying with numerous regulations pertaining to our business is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties. We are subject to CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. We have a current certificate of accreditation under CLIA to perform testing. To renew this certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our laboratory. We are also required to maintain a license to conduct testing in California. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. Moreover, several states require that we hold licenses to test specimens from patients residing in those states. Other states may have similar requirements or may adopt similar requirements in the future. Finally, we may be subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions as we seek to expand international distribution of our test. If we were to lose our CLIA accreditation or California license, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to sell Oncotype DX, which would limit our revenues and harm our business. If we were to lose our license in other states where we are required to hold licenses, we would not be able to test specimens from those states. 30 Table of Contents We are subject to other regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, including:  Medicare billing and payment regulations applicable to clinical laboratories;  the federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-kickback Law and state anti-kickback prohibitions;  the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and the state equivalents;  the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996;  the Medicare civil money penalty and exclusion requirements; and  the federal civil and criminal False Claims Act. We have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws, including policies and procedures relating to financial arrangements between us and physicians who refer patients to us. In the ordinary course of our business, we conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. Our compliance is also subject to governmental review. The growth of our business and sales organization may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, we could be required to refund payments received by us, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results. Our financial results depend on sales of one test, Oncotype DX, and we will need to generate sufficient revenues from this and other tests to run our business. For the foreseeable future, we expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of one test, Oncotype DX. We have been selling this test since January 2004. We are in various stages of research and development for other tests that we may offer as well as for enhancements to our existing test. We do not currently expect to commercialize tests for colon cancer until at least 2009, and we are not currently able to estimate when we may be able to commercialize tests for other cancers or whether we will be successful in doing so. If we are unable to increase sales of Oncotype DX or to successfully develop and commercialize other tests or enhancements, our revenues and our ability to achieve profitability would be impaired, and the market price of our common stock could decline. New test development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may be unable to commercialize any of the tests we are currently developing. We have multiple tests in various stages of development and devote considerable resources to research and development. For example, we are currently in the development stage of the application of our technology to predict recurrence and the therapeutic benefit of chemotherapy in colon cancer, and we are conducting early development studies in prostate, renal cell and lung cancers and melanoma. There can be no assurance that our technologies will be capable of reliably predicting the recurrence of other types of cancer or other cancers, such as colon, with the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be clinically and commercially useful for the treatment of other cancers, or that we can develop those technologies at all. In addition, before we can develop diagnostic tests for new cancers and commercialize any new products, we will need to:  conduct substantial research and development;  conduct validation studies;  expend significant funds; and 31 Table of Contents  develop and scale our laboratory processes to accommodate different tests. This process involves a high degree of risk and takes several years. Our product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including:  failure of the product at the research or development stage;  difficulty in accessing archival tissue samples, especially tissue samples with known clinical results; or  lack of clinical validation data to support the effectiveness of the product. Few research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical trials often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of a product candidate or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical trials, which would adversely impact the timing for generating potential revenues from those product candidates. In addition, as we develop products, we will have to make significant investments in product development, marketing and selling resources. If a clinical validation study fails to demonstrate the prospectively defined endpoints of the study, we would likely abandon the development of the product or product feature that was the subject of the clinical trial, which could harm our business. If we are unable to support demand for our tests, our business may suffer. We have recently added a second shift at our clinical laboratory facility and will need to ramp up our testing capacity as our test volume grows. We continue to implement increases in scale and related processing, customer service, billing and systems process improvements, and to expand our internal quality assurance program to support testing on a larger scale. We will also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our tests. We cannot assure you that any increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be successfully implemented or that appropriate personnel will be available. As additional products are commercialized, we will need to bring new equipment on-line, implement new systems, controls and procedures and hire personnel with different qualifications. Failure to implement necessary procedures or to hire the necessary personnel could result in higher cost of processing or an inability to meet market demand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform tests on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand or that we will be successful in responding to the growing complexity of our testing operations. If we encounter difficulty meeting market demand for Oncotype DX or future products, our reputation could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer. We may experience limits on our revenues if physicians decide not to order our test. If medical practitioners do not order Oncotype DX or any future tests developed by us, we will likely not be able to create demand for our products in sufficient volume for us to become profitable. To generate demand, we will need to continue to make oncologists, surgeons and pathologists aware of the benefits of Oncotype DX and any products we may develop in the future through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education by our sales force. In addition, we will need to demonstrate our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement coverage from third-party payors. Until recently, guidelines and practices regarding the treatment of breast cancer often recommended that chemotherapy be considered in most cases, including many cases in which our test might indicate that, based on our clinical trial results, chemotherapy would be of little or no benefit. Accordingly, physicians may be reluctant to order a test that may suggest recommending against chemotherapy in treating breast cancer. Moreover, our test provides quantitative information not currently provided by pathologists and it is performed at our facility rather than by the pathologist in a local laboratory, so pathologists may be reluctant to support our test. These facts may make it difficult for us to convince medical practitioners to order Oncotype DX for their patients, which could limit our ability to generate revenues and our ability to achieve profitability. We may experience limits on our revenues if patients decide not to use our test. Some patients may decide not to order our test due to its price, part or all of which may be payable directly by the patient if the applicable payor denies reimbursement in full or in part. Even if medical practitioners recommend 32 Table of Contents that their patients use our test, patients may still decide not to use Oncotype DX, either because they do not want to be made aware of the likelihood of recurrence or they wish to pursue a particular course of therapy regardless of test results. If only a small portion of the patient population decides to use our test, we will experience limits on our revenues and our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to develop products to keep pace with rapid technological, medical and scientific change, our operating results and competitive position would be harmed. In recent years, there have been numerous advances in technologies relating to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. For example, technologies in addition to ours now reportedly permit measurement of gene expression in FPE tissue specimens. Also, new hormonal therapies such as aromatase inhibitors are viewed by physicians as promising therapies for breast cancer with more tolerable side effects than those associated with tamoxifen, the hormonal therapy commonly used today in treatment. For advanced cancer, new chemotherapeutic strategies are being developed that may increase survival time and reduce toxic side effects. These advances require us to continuously develop new products and enhance existing products to keep pace with evolving standards of care. Our test could become obsolete unless we continually innovate and expand our product to demonstrate recurrence and treatment benefit in patients treated with new therapies. New treatment therapies typically have only a few years of clinical data associated with them, which limits our ability to perform clinical studies and correlate sets of genes to a new treatments effectiveness. If we are unable to demonstrate the applicability of our test to new treatments, then sales of our test could decline, which would harm our revenues. Our rights to use technologies licensed from third parties are not within our control, and we may not be able to sell our products if we lose our existing rights or cannot obtain new rights on reasonable terms. We license from third parties technology necessary to develop our products. For example, we license technology from Roche that we use to analyze genes for possible inclusion in our tests and that we use in our laboratory to conduct our test. In return for the use of a third partys technology, we may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of our products. Royalties are a component of cost of product revenues and impact the margin on our test. We may need to license other technology to commercialize future products. Our business may suffer if these licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license or fail to prevent infringement by third parties, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms. Our competitive position depends on maintaining intellectual property protection. Our ability to compete and to achieve and maintain profitability depends on our ability to protect our proprietary discoveries and technologies. We currently rely on a combination of patent applications, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements, material data transfer agreements, license agreements and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely upon unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Patents may be granted to us jointly with other organizations, and while we may have a right of first refusal, we cannot guarantee that a joint owner will not license rights to another party, and cannot guarantee that a joint owner will cooperate with us in the enforcement of patent rights. As of December 31, 2007, we had two issued patents, one of which was issued jointly to us and to NSABP. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that our issued patent or any patents that might ultimately be issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will protect our technology. Any patents that may be issued to us might be challenged by third parties as being invalid or unenforceable, or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation and use of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. From time to time, the United States Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, competitors may develop their own versions of our test in countries where we did not 33 Table of Contents apply for patents or where our patents have not issued and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use of their test by physicians or patients in other countries. We may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages. We have received notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights in the past and may from time to time receive additional notices. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in such actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or the validity of our patents, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. We may also initiate claims to defend our intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, could divert managements attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we were to be found to have willfully infringed a third partys patent) to the party claiming infringement, develop non-infringing technology, stop selling our test or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business. In addition, revising our test to include the non-infringing technologies would require us to re-validate our test, which would be costly and time-consuming. Also, we may be unaware of pending patent applications that relate to our test. Parties making infringement claims on future issued patents may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent us from selling our test or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could harm our business. There are a number of patents and patent applications that may constitute prior art in the field of genomic-based diagnostics. We may be required to pay royalties, damages and costs to firms who own the rights to these patents, or we might be restricted from using any of the inventions claimed in those patents. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenues or achieve profitability. Our principal competition comes from existing diagnostic methods used by pathologists and oncologists. These methods have been used for many years and are therefore difficult to change or supplement. In addition, companies offering capital equipment and kits or reagents to local pathology laboratories represent another source of potential competition. These kits are used directly by the pathologist, which facilitates adoption more readily than tests like Oncotype DX that are performed outside the pathology laboratory. In addition, few diagnostic methods are as expensive as Oncotype DX. We also face competition from many companies that offer products or have conducted research to profile genes, gene expression or protein expression in breast cancer, including Celera Genomics, a business segment of Applera Corporation, and Clarient Diagnostic Services as well as Agendia B.V. and other private companies. Commercial laboratories with strong distribution networks for diagnostic tests, such as Genzyme Corporation, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings and Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, may become competitors. Other potential competitors include companies that develop diagnostic tests such as Bayer Diagnostics, a division of Siemens AG, Roche Diagnostics, a division of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and Veridex LLC, a Johnson & Johnson company, as well as other companies and academic and research institutions. Our competitors may invent and commercialize technology platforms that compete with ours. In addition, in December 2005, the federal government allocated a significant amount of funding to The Cancer Genome Atlas, a project aimed at developing a comprehensive catalog of the genetic mutations and other genomic changes that occur in cancers and maintaining the information in a free public database. As more information regarding cancer genomics becomes available to the public, we anticipate that more products aimed at identifying targeted treatment options will be developed and these products may compete with ours. In addition, competitors may develop their own versions of our test in countries where we did not apply for patents or where our patents have not issued and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use of their test by physicians or patients in other countries. 34 Table of Contents Our test is considered relatively expensive for a diagnostic test. We increased the price of our test from $3,460 to $3,650 effective June 1, 2007, and we may raise prices in the future. This could impact reimbursement of and demand for Oncotype DX. Many of our present and potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial and technical resources and development, production and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop lower-priced, less complex tests that could be viewed by physicians and payors as functionally equivalent to our test, which could force us to lower the list price of our test and impact our operating margins and our ability to achieve profitability. Some competitors have developed tests cleared for marketing by FDA. There may be a marketing differentiation or perception that an FDA-cleared test is more desirable than Oncotype DX, and that may discourage adoption and reimbursement of our test. If we are unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance for and sales of our test, which could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or achieving or sustaining profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Our research and development efforts will be hindered if we are not able to contract with third parties for access to archival tissue samples. Under standard clinical practice in the United States, tumor biopsies removed from patients are chemically preserved and embedded in paraffin wax and stored. Our clinical development relies on our ability to secure access to these archived tumor biopsy samples, as well as information pertaining to their associated clinical outcomes. Others have demonstrated their ability to study archival samples and often compete with us for access. Additionally, the process of negotiating access to archived samples is lengthy since it typically involves numerous parties and approval levels to resolve complex issues such as usage rights, institutional review board approval, privacy rights, publication rights, intellectual property ownership and research parameters. If we are not able to negotiate access to archival tumor tissue samples with hospitals and collaborators, or if other laboratories or our competitors secure access to these samples before us, our ability to research, develop and commercialize future products will be limited or delayed. If we cannot maintain our current clinical collaborations and enter into new collaborations, our product development could be delayed. We rely on and expect to continue to rely on clinical collaborators to perform a substantial portion of our clinical trial functions. If any of our collaborators were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct its collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner, the research, development or commercialization of the products contemplated by the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. If any of our collaboration agreements are terminated, or if we are unable to renew those collaborations on acceptable terms, we would be required to seek alternative collaborations. We may not be able to negotiate additional collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, and these collaborations may not be successful. In the past, we have entered into clinical trial collaborations with highly regarded organizations in the cancer field including, for example, NSABP. Our success in the future depends in part on our ability to enter into agreements with other leading cancer organizations. This can be difficult due to internal and external constraints placed on these organizations. Some organizations may limit the number of collaborations they have with any one company so as to not be perceived as biased or conflicted. Organizations may also have insufficient administrative and related infrastructure to enable collaborations with many companies at once, which can extend the time it takes to develop, negotiate and implement a collaboration. Additionally, organizations often insist on retaining the rights to publish the clinical data resulting from the collaboration. The publication of clinical data in peer-reviewed journals is a crucial step in commercializing and obtaining reimbursement for a test such as ours, and our inability to control when, if ever, results are published may delay or limit our ability to derive sufficient revenues from any product that may result from a collaboration. From time to time we expect to engage in discussions with potential clinical collaborators which may or may not lead to collaborations. However, we cannot guarantee that any discussions will result in clinical collaborations or that any clinical studies which may result will be enrolled or completed in a reasonable time frame or with successful outcomes. Once news of discussions regarding possible collaborations are known in the medical community, regardless of whether the news is accurate, failure to announce a collaborative agreement or the entitys 35 Table of Contents announcement of a collaboration with an entity other than us may result in adverse speculation about us, our product or our technology, resulting in harm to our reputation and our business. The loss of key members of our senior management team or our inability to retain highly skilled scientists, clinicians and salespeople could adversely affect our business. Our success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our executive management team and others in key management positions. The efforts of each of these persons together will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and testing processes and as we attempt to transition to a company with more than one commercialized product. If we were to lose one or more of these key employees, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies. Our research and development programs and commercial laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and technicians, including geneticists, licensed laboratory technicians, chemists, biostatisticians and engineers. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel. In addition, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain salespeople with extensive experience in oncology and close relationships with medical oncologists, surgeons, pathologists and other hospital personnel. We may have difficulties locating, recruiting or retaining qualified salespeople, which could cause a delay or decline in the rate of adoption of our products. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to support our discovery, development and sales programs. All of our employees are at-will employees, which means that either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time. If our sole laboratory facility becomes inoperable, we will be unable to perform our test and our business will be harmed. We do not have redundant laboratory facilities. We perform all of our diagnostic testing in our laboratory located in Redwood City, California. Redwood City is situated on or near earthquake fault lines. Our facility and the equipment we use to perform our tests would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our tests for some period of time. The inability to perform our tests or the backlog of tests that could develop if our facility is inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers in the future. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In order to rely on a third party to perform our tests, we could only use another facility with established state licensure and CLIA accreditation under the scope of which Oncotype DX could be performed following validation and other required procedures. We cannot assure you that we would be able to find another CLIA-certified facility willing to adopt Oncotype DX and comply with the required procedures, or that this laboratory would be willing to perform the tests for us on commercially reasonable terms. In order to establish a redundant laboratory facility, we would have to spend considerable time and money securing adequate space, constructing the facility, recruiting and training employees, and establishing the additional operational and administrative infrastructure necessary to support a second facility. Additionally, any new clinical laboratory facility opened by us would be subject to certification under CLIA and licensed by several states, including California and New York, which can take a significant amount of time and result in delays in our ability to begin operations. 36 Table of Contents Changes in healthcare policy could subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt sales of Oncotype DX and increase our costs. Healthcare policy has been a subject of extensive discussion in the executive and legislative branches of the federal and many state governments. We developed our commercialization strategy for Oncotype DX based on existing healthcare policies. Changes in healthcare policy, such as changes in the FDA regulatory policy for LDTs, the creation of broad limits for diagnostic products in general or requirements that Medicare patients pay for portions of clinical laboratory tests or services received, could substantially interrupt the sales of Oncotype DX, increase costs and divert managements attention. For example, in 1989, the U.S. Congress passed federal self-referral prohibitions commonly known as the Stark Law, significantly restricting, regulating and changing laboratories relationships with physicians. We cannot predict what changes, if any, will be proposed or adopted or the effect that such proposals or adoption may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, a sole supplier, for some of our laboratory instruments and materials and may not be able to find replacements in the event our suppliers no longer supply that equipment or those materials. We rely solely on Applied Biosystems, a division of Applera Corporation, to supply some of the laboratory equipment on which we perform our tests. We periodically forecast our needs for laboratory equipment and enter into standard purchase orders with Applied Biosystems based on these forecasts. We believe that there are relatively few equipment manufacturers other than Applied Biosystems that are currently capable of supplying the equipment necessary for Oncotype DX. Even if we were to identify other suppliers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into agreements with such suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms, if at all. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing from Applied Biosystems the quality and quantity of equipment we require for Oncotype DX, we may need to reconfigure our test process, which would result in delays in commercialization or an interruption in sales. If any of these events occur, our business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, if Applied Biosystems deems us to have become uncreditworthy, it has the right to require alternative payment terms from us, including payment in advance. We are also required to indemnify Applied Biosystems against any damages caused by any legal action or proceeding brought by a third party against Applied Biosystems for damages caused by our failure to obtain required approval with any regulatory agency. We also rely on several sole suppliers for certain laboratory materials which we use to perform our tests. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials, we cannot be certain that these strategies will be effective. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing these laboratory materials, delays in commercialization or an interruption in sales could occur. We may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which would make it difficult to execute our business strategy. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. In addition, rapid and significant growth will place strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure, including customer service and our clinical laboratory. Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy. If we were sued for product liability or professional liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources. The marketing, sale and use of our test could lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that our test failed to perform as it was designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the information we provide to customers or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. For example, physicians sometimes order Oncotype DX for patients who do not have the same specific clinical attributes indicated on the Oncotype DX report form as those for which the test provides clinical experience information from validation studies. It is our practice to offer medical consultation to physicians ordering Oncotype 37 Table of Contents DX for such patients, including N+ patients, ER- patients, or male breast cancer patients. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend. Although we believe that our existing product and professional liability insurance is adequate, we cannot assure you that our insurance would fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability or professional liability claims. Any product liability or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation, result in the recall of our products, or cause current collaborators to terminate existing agreements and potential collaborators to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations. If we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages. Our activities currently require the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials, hazardous materials and chemicals and may in the future require the use of radioactive compounds. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may be significant and could negatively affect our operating results. Our dependence on distributors for foreign sales of Oncotype DX could limit or prevent us from selling our test in foreign markets and from realizing long-term international revenue growth. International sales as a percentage of net revenues are expected to remain modest in the near term as we focus our efforts on the sale of Oncotype DX in the United States. We have established exclusive distribution networks for Oncotype DX in Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom, and may enter into other similar arrangements in other countries in the future. Over the long term, we intend to grow our business internationally, and to do so we will need to attract additional distributors to expand the territories in which we sell Oncotype DX. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell Oncotype DX to the level of our expectations. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas, we may not realize long-term international revenue growth. Regulatory requirements in foreign markets may also impact our ability to realize long-term international revenue growth. We may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense. As part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets, as well as technology licensing arrangements. We also may pursue strategic alliances that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our product offerings or distribution. We have no experience with respect to acquiring other companies and limited experience with respect to the formation of collaborations, strategic alliances and joint ventures. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions by us also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm our operating results. Integration of an acquired company also may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture. To finance any acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. 38 Table of Contents Our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future may limit our ability to develop and commercialize new tests and technologies. We expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure, commercial operations and research and development activities. Specifically, we may need to raise capital to, among other things:  sustain commercialization of our initial test or enhancements to that test;  increase our selling and marketing efforts to drive market adoption and address competitive developments;  further expand our clinical laboratory operations;  expand our technologies into other areas of cancer;  fund our clinical validation study activities;  expand our research and development activities;  acquire or license technologies; and  finance capital expenditures and our general and administrative expenses. Our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:  the level of research and development investment required to maintain and improve our technology position;  costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;  our need or decision to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;  changes in product development plans needed to address any difficulties in commercialization;  changes in the regulatory environment, including any decision by FDA to regulate our activities;  competing technological and market developments;  the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors; and  changes in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to scale back our operations or limit our research and development activities. We must implement additional and expensive finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy public company reporting requirements, which will increase our costs and require additional management resources. As a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other requirements has increased our costs and required additional management resources. We will need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy existing reporting requirements. If we fail to maintain or implement adequate controls, if we are unable to complete the required Section 404 assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting in future Form 10-K filings, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over 39 Table of Contents financial reporting in future Form 10-K filings, our ability to obtain additional financing could be impaired. In addition, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting and in the accuracy of our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act. A lack of investor confidence in the reliability and accuracy of our public reporting could cause our stock price to decline. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
