IDENTITY OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORS Not applicable. ITEM 2. OFFER STATISTICS AND EXPECTED TIMETABLE Not applicable. ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION A. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected consolidated income statement data and consolidated cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, and the selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2006, and 2007 have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. The selected consolidated income statement data and consolidated cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 and the selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 are derived from combining our audited consolidated financial statements which are not included elsewhere in this annual report and the financial statements of the acquired businesses described below. We acquired from Sinopec Group Company the operations of Sinopec Group Maoming Petrochemical Company (Sinopec Maoming), Xi’an Petrochemical Main Factory (Xi’an Petrochemical) and Tahe Oilfield Petrochemical Factory (Tahe Petrochemical) in 2003, the operations of Sinopec Group Tianjin Petrochemical Company, Sinopec Group Luoyang Petrochemical General Plant, Zhongyuan Petrochemical Company Limited, Sinopec Group Guangzhou Petrochemical General Plant and certain catalyst plants (collectively, Petrochemical and Catalyst Assets) in 2004, the equity interests in Sinopec Hainan Refining and Chemical Company Limited (Sinopec Hainan) and certain oil and gas production companies (Oil Production Plants) in 2006, and the equity interests in Zhanjiang Dongxing Petroleum Company Limited, Sinopec Hangzhou Oil Refinery Plant, Yangzhou Petrochemical Plant, Jiangsu Taizhou Petrochemical Plant, and Sinopec Qingjiang Petrochemical Company Limited (collectively, Refinery Plants) in 2007. As we and these companies are under the common control of Sinopec Group Company, our acquisitions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as combination of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, the acquired assets and related liabilities have been accounted for at historical cost and our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combinations have been restated to include the financial condition and the results of operation of these companies on a combined basis. Moreover, the selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” included elsewhere in this annual report. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS. 6 Years Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 RMB RMB RMB RMB RMB (in millions, except per share and per ADS data) Consolidated Income Statement Data(1): Operating revenues 447,292 617,951 817,048 1,061,741 1,204,843 Other income - - 9,777 5,161 4,863 Operating expenses (407,779) (555,003) (758,848) (986,270) (1,123,842) Operating income 39,513 62,948 67,977 80,632 85,864 Income before income tax 35,640 59,386 64,525 78,542 83,464 Income tax (10,843) (18,096) (19,872) (23,504) (24,721) Net income attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 22,648 35,289 41,354 53,603 56,533 Basic earnings per share(2) 0.26 0.41 0.48 0.62 0.65 Basic earnings per ADS(2) 26.12 40.70 47.70 61.82 65.20 Cash dividends declared per share 0.09 0.10 0.12 0.13 0.16 Segment results Exploration and production 19,565 26,397 48,334 63,182 48,766 Refining 6,201 4,917 (3,695) (25,710) (10,452) Marketing and distribution 11,943 14,716 10,350 30,234 35,727 Chemicals 3,640 18,843 14,186 14,458 13,306 Corporate and others (1,836) (1,925) (1,198) (1,532) (1,483) Operating income 39,513 62,948 67,977 80,632 85,864 As of December 31, 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 RMB RMB RMB RMB RMB (in millions) Consolidated Balance Sheet Data(1): Cash and cash equivalents 17,286 18,817 15,088 7,063 7,696 Total current assets 104,909 125,862 148,984 146,490 185,116 Total non-current assets(3) 320,600 355,729 396,169 464,342 547,609 Total assets(3) 425,509 481,591 545,153 610,832 732,725 Short-term debts and loans from Sinopec Group Company and its affiliates (including current portion of long-term debts) 34,707 45,231 46,674 63,480 60,494 Long-term debts and loans from Sinopec Group Company and its affiliates (excluding current portion of long-term debts) 86,156 95,784 103,408 100,637 120,314 Equity attributable to equity shareholders of the Company(3) 174,444 195,239 226,099 264,334 307,433 Capital employed(4) 305,269 349,909 392,267 443,711 505,870 Years Ended December 31 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 RMB RMB RMB RMB RMB (in millions) Other Financial Data(1): Net cash from operating activities 63,756 68,076 78,663 92,507 119,594 Net cash (used in)/generated from financing activities (16,008) 6,250 (4,257) 2,878 (5,310) 7 Net cash used in investing activities (50,457) (72,794) (78,113) (103,385) (113,587) Capital expenditure Exploration and production 22,238 23,199 25,479 35,198 54,498 Refining 10,144 15,789 20,270 22,587 22,763 Marketing and distribution 6,826 16,678 10,954 11,319 12,548 Chemicals 7,680 11,025 9,386 12,629 16,184 Corporate and others 518 1,550 1,164 2,170 3,289 Total 47,406 68,241 67,253 83,903 109,282 __________ (1) The acquisitions of Sinopec Maoming, Xi’an Petrochemical and Tahe Petrochemical in 2003, the acquisitions of Petrochemical and Catalyst Assets in 2004, the acquisitions of equity interests in Sinopec Hainan and Oil Production Plants in 2006 and the acquisitions of equity interests in the Refining Plants in 2007 from Sinopec Group Company are treated as “combination of entities under common control” which are accounted in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities have been accounted for at historical cost and the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combinations have been restated to include the financial condition and results of operation of these acquired companies on a combined basis. The considerations for these acquisitions were treated as equity transactions. (2) Basic earnings per share have been computed by dividing net income attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares in issue. Basic earnings per ADS have been computed as if all of our issued and outstanding shares, including domestic shares and H shares, are represented by ADSs during each of the years presented. Each ADS represents 100 shares. (3) Properties, plant and equipment acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Sinopec Maoming, Xi’an Petrochemical and Tahe Petrochemical in 2003, the acquisitions of Petrochemical and Catalyst Assets in 2004, the acquisitions of equity interests in Sinopec Hainan and Oil Production Plants in 2006 and the acquisitions of equity interests in the Refining Plants were evaluated by independent appraisers under applicable PRC laws and regulations at the time of such acquisitions by Sinopec Corp. (4) Capital employed is derived by the sum of short-term debts, long-term debts, loans from Sinopec Group Company and its affiliates and total equity less cash and cash equivalents. B. CAPITALIZATION AND INDEBTEDNESS Not applicable. C. REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND USE OF PROCEEDS Not applicable. D. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Our Business Operation Our business may be adversely affected by the fluctuation of crude oil and refined petroleum product prices. We currently consume large amount of crude oil and other raw materials to manufacture our refined products and petrochemical products. While we try to match price increases in products produced by us with corresponding crude oil price increases, our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers is dependent on international and domestic market conditions as well as the PRC government price control over refined petroleum products. For example, crude oil price fluctuated at a historically high level in the past three years, but we were not able to fully pass the increased material cost to our customers, in part due to the government’s price control over certain refined petroleum products including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Although it was reported that new petroleum products price-setting mechanism would be formulated by the relevant government authority, we cannot predict when the revised price-setting mechanism will be implemented, and if implemented, to what extent the new price-setting mechanism will allow us to pass our increased crude oil costs to our refined petroleum product customers. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by the fluctuation of crude oil and refined petroleum product prices. 8 Our continued business success depends in part on our ability to replace reserves and develop newly discovered reserves. Our ability to achieve our growth objectives is dependent in part on our level of success in discovering or acquiring additional oil and natural gas reserves and further exploring our current reserve base. Our exploration and development activities for additional reserves also expose us to inherent risks associated with drilling, including the risk that no economically productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. Exploring for, developing and acquiring reserves is highly risky and capital intensive. Without reserve additions through further exploration and development or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline over time, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We rely heavily on outside suppliers for crude oil and other raw materials, and we may even experience disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil and other raw materials. We purchase a significant portion of our crude oil and other feedstock requirements from outside suppliers located in different countries and areas in the world. In 2007, approximately 72% of the crude oil required for our refinery business was sourced from international suppliers, some of which are from countries that are on the sanction list published and administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of Treasury. In addition, our development will leave us no choice but to source an increasing amount of crude oil from outside suppliers. We are subject to the political, geographical and economic risks associated with these countries and areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or disrupted due to any natural disasters or political events, it is possible that we would be unable to find sufficient alternative sources of supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our business faces operation risks and natural disasters that may cause significant property damages, personal injuries and interruption of operations, and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all the financial losses incurred by us. Exploring for, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas and producing and transporting refined and petrochemical products involve a number of operating hazards. Significant operating hazards and natural disasters may cause interruption to our operations, property or environmental damages as well as personal injuries, and each of these incidents could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have been paying high attention to the safety of our operation and implemented Health, Safety and Environment Management System within our company with the view to preventing accidents and reducing personal injuries, property losses and environment pollution. We also maintain insurance coverage on our property, plant, equipment and inventory. However, our preventative measures may not be effective and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all the financial losses caused by the operation risks and natural disasters. Losses incurred or payments required to be made by us due to operating hazards or natural disasters, which are not fully insured, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The oil and natural gas reserves data in this annual report are only estimates, and our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may differ materially from these estimates. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, and in the timing of development expenditures and the projection of future rates of production. The reserve data set forth in this annual report represent estimates only. Adverse changes in economic conditions may render it uneconomical to develop certain reserves. Our actual production, revenues, taxes and fees payable and development and operating expenditures with respect to our reserves may likely vary from these estimates. The reliability of reserves estimates depends on: · the quality and quantity of technical and economic data; · the prevailing oil and gas prices applicable to our production; · the production performance of the reservoirs; 9 · extensive engineering judgments; and · consistency in the PRC government's oil policies. In addition, new drilling, testing and production following the estimates may cause substantial upward or downward revisions in the estimates. Our operations may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the market. Most of our revenues are attributable to sales of refined petroleum products and petrochemical products, and certain of these businesses and related products have historically been cyclical and sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the availability and prices of feedstock and general economic conditions, such as changes in industry capacity and output levels, cyclical changes in regional and global economic conditions, prices and availability of substitute products and changes in consumer demand. With the further reduction of tariffs and other import restrictions in the PRC on refined petroleum products and petrochemical products, many of our products have become increasingly subject to the cyclicality of global markets, and hence, our operations may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the market. We face strong competition from domestic and foreign competitors. Among our competitors, some are major integrated petroleum and petrochemical companies within and outside the PRC, which have recently become more significant participants in the petroleum and petrochemical industry in China. On December 4, 2006, Ministry of Commerce of the PRC promulgated the “Administrative Rules for Crude Oil Market” and “Administrative Rules for Refined Petroleum Products Market” to open the wholesale market of crude oil and refined petroleum products to new market entrants. As a result, we expect to face more competition in both crude oil and refined petroleum product markets. We believe such trend will continue. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our financing costs are subject to change in interest rates. Changes in interest rates have affected and will continue to affect our financing costs and, ultimately, our results of operations. By December 21, 2007, the People’s Bank of China, or the PBOC, had raised the benchmark one-year lending rate six times from March to December in 2007 from 6.12% to 7.47%. The increased lending rate drove up our cost of bank borrowings. Our interest expenses (excluding capitalized interest) in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were RMB 5,725 million, RMB 7,101 million and RMB 7,314 million, respectively. The PBOC may further increase the lending rates according to China’s macro economic conditions, and any such event may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Controlling Shareholder Related party transactions. We have engaged from time to time and will continue to engage in a variety of transactions with Sinopec Group, which provides to us a number of services, including, but not limited to, ancillary supply, engineering, maintenance, transport, lease of land use right, lease of buildings, as well as educational and community services. The nature of our transactions with Sinopec Group is governed by a number of service and other contracts between Sinopec Group and us. We have established various schemes in those agreements so that these transactions would be entered into under terms at arm’s length. However, we cannot assure you that Sinopec Group Company or any of its members would not take actions that may favor its interests or its other subsidiaries’ interests over ours. Non-competition. Sinopec Group Company has interests in certain businesses, such as oil refining, petrochemical producing and retail service stations, which compete or are likely to compete, either directly or indirectly, with our businesses. To avoid the adverse effects brought by the competition between us and Sinopec Group Company to the maximum extent possible, we and Sinopec Group Company have entered into a non-competition agreement whereby Sinopec Group Company has agreed to: refrain from operating new businesses which compete or could compete with us in any of our domestic or international markets; grant us an option to purchase Sinopec Group Company's operations that compete or could compete with our businesses; operate its sales enterprises and service stations in a manner uniform to our sales and service operations; and appoint us as sales agent for certain of its products which compete or could compete 10 with our products. Notwithstanding the foregoing contractual arrangements, because Sinopec Group Company is our controlling shareholder, Sinopec Group Company may take actions that may conflict with our own interests. Risks Relating to the PRC Government regulations may limit our activities and affect our business operations. The PRC government, though gradually liberalizing its regulation of petroleum and petrochemical industry, continues to exercise a certain degree of control over the petroleum and petrochemical industry in China by, among other measures: · licensing the right to explore and produce crude oil and natural gas; · publishing from time to time guidance prices for natural gas and refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel; · assessing taxes and fees payable; · setting import and export quotas and procedures for crude oil and refined petroleum products; and · setting safety, environmental and quality standards. As a result, we may face constraints on our flexibility and ability to expand our business operations or to maximize our profitability. Our business operations may be adversely affected by present or future environmental regulations. As an integrated petroleum and petrochemical company, we are subject to extensive environmental protection laws and regulations in China. These laws and regulations permit: · the imposition of fees for the discharge of waste substances; · the levy of fines and payments for damages for serious environmental offenses; and · the government, at its discretion, to close any facility which fails to comply with orders and require it to correct or stop operations causing environmental damage. Our production operations produce substantial amounts of waste water, gas and solid waste materials. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and revocation. We have established a system to treat waste materials to prevent and reduce pollution. The PRC government has moved, and may move further, toward more rigorous enforcement of applicable laws, and toward the adoption of more stringent environmental standards, which, in turn, would require us to incur additional expenditures on environmental matters. Some of our development plans require compliance with state policies and regulatory confirmation and registration. We are currently engaged in a number of construction, renovation and expansion projects. Some of our large construction, renovation and expansion projects are subject to governmental confirmation and registration. The timing and cost of completion of these projects will depend on numerous factors, including when we can receive the required confirmation and registration from relevant PRC government authorities and the general economic condition in China. If any of our important projects required for our future growth are not confirmed or registered, or not confirmed or registered in a timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Foreign enterprise holders of H shares may be subject to PRC taxation. Historically, dividends paid by us to foreign enterprise holders of H shares outside the PRC were exempted from PRC income tax pursuant to a notice issued by the Chinese State Administration of Taxation in 1993. According to the same notice, 11 gains realized by foreign enterprises upon sale of H shares were also exempted from PRC enterprise income tax. However, the effectiveness of these exemptions became unclear and uncertain after the new Enterprise Income Tax Law took effect on January 1, 2008. In accordance with the new Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, any dividends derived from the revenues accumulated from January 1, 2008 and are paid to the shareholders who are non-resident enterprises in the PRC, as well as any capital gains realized by such shareholders upon the sale of overseas-listed shares will be subject to the PRC withholding tax levied at a rate of 10%, unless exempted or reduced pursuant to an applicable double-taxation treaty or other exemptions. The capital gains realized by resident enterprises, including enterprises established under the laws of non-PRC jurisdictions but whose “de facto management body” is located in the PRC, upon the sales of overseas-listed shares are subject to the PRC enterprise income tax. The implementation of the new Enterprise Income Tax Law in these respects remain uncertain, and we may be required to withhold taxes in the future when paying any dividends to our H shareholders who are non-resident enterprises. See “Item 10. Additional Information—Taxation—PRC Taxation”. Government control of currency conversion and exchange rate fluctuation may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. A portion of such revenues will need to be converted into other currencies to meet our foreign currency needs, which include, among other things: · import of crude oil and other materials; · debt service on foreign currency-denominated debt; · purchases of imported equipment; · payment of the principals and interests of bonds issued overseas; and · payment of any cash dividends declared in respect of the H shares (including ADS). The existing foreign exchange regulations have significantly reduced government foreign exchange controls for transactions under the current account, including trade and service related foreign exchange transactions and payment of dividends. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. These limitations could affect our ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing, or to obtain foreign exchange for capital expenditures. The PRC government has stated publicly that it intends to make the Renminbi freely convertible in the future. However, we cannot predict whether the PRC government will continue its existing foreign exchange policy and when the PRC government will allow free conversion of Renminbi. The value of the Renminbi against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions. Under the current policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. The value of Renminbi against the US dollar has fluctuated on a daily basis within narrow ranges, but overall has strengthened against the US dollar. As we purchase a significant portion of our crude oil requirement from international market which are benchmarked to US dollar-denominated international prices, fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollars and certain other foreign currencies may affect our crude oil costs. Risks relating to enforcement of shareholder rights; Mandatory arbitration. Currently, the primary sources of shareholder rights are our articles of association, the PRC Company Law and the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which, among other things, impose certain standards of conduct, fairness and disclosure on us, our directors and our controlling shareholder. In general, their provisions for protection of shareholder's rights and access to information are different from those applicable to companies incorporated in the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries. In addition, the mechanism for enforcement of rights under the corporate framework to which we are subject may also be relatively undeveloped and untested. To our knowledge, there has not been any published report of judicial enforcement in the PRC by H share shareholders of their rights under constituent documents of joint stock limited companies or the PRC Company Law or in the application or interpretation of the PRC or Hong Kong regulatory provisions applicable to PRC joint stock 12 limited companies. We cannot assure you that our shareholders will enjoy protections that they may be entitled in other jurisdictions. China does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States, the United Kingdom or most other Western countries, and therefore recognition and enforcement in China of judgments of a court in any of these jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may not be assured. Our articles of association as well as the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange provide that most disputes between holders of H shares and us, our directors, supervisors, officers or holders of domestic shares, arising out of the articles of association or the PRC Company Law concerning the affairs of our company or with respect to the transfer of our shares, are to be resolved through arbitration by arbitration organizations in Hong Kong or China, rather than through a court of law. On June 18, 1999, an arrangement was made between Hong Kong and the PRC for the mutual enforcement of arbitral awards. This new arrangement was approved by the Supreme People's Court of the PRC and the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and became effective on February 1, 2000. So far as we are aware, no action has been brought in China by any shareholder to enforce an arbitral award, and we are uncertain as to the outcome of any action brought in China to enforce an arbitral award granted to shareholders.
