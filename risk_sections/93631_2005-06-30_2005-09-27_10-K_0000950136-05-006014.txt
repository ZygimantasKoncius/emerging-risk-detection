ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS WE RELY ON A FEW KEY CUSTOMERS, AND THE LOSS OF ANY ONE KEY CUSTOMER WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A GROWING TREND TOWARD RETAIL CONSOLIDATION AND WE ARE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT UPON FEWER CUSTOMERS. Over 80% of our sales are generated from less than 30 of our customers and a significant amount of our revenues are generated from a few major customers. A significant decrease in business from or loss of any of our major customers could harm our business and financial condition by causing a significant decline in revenues attributable to such customers. Wal-Mart accounted for 20 % of sales for fiscal 2005, 38% of sales for fiscal 2004 and 42% of sales for fiscal 2003. Target accounted for 15 % of sales for fiscal 2005, 3 % of sales for fiscal 2004 and 4 % of sales for fiscal 2003. Sears, Roebuck and Company accounted for 6% of sales for fiscal 2005 and 10% of sales for fiscal 2004 and 2003. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our customers and therefore our business is subject to unpredictable increases and decreases in sales depending upon the size and number of orders that we receive each time we present our products to our customers. If we experience a significant decrease in sales to any of our major customers, and are unable to replace such sales volume with orders from other major customers, there would be a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. OUR BUSINESS RELIES ON CONSUMER SPENDING PATTERNS. Our business is susceptible to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions such as the levels of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence. Reduced consumer spending on apparel and accessories could lead to a decline in revenues and there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE, IT COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF REVENUES. The intimate apparel business is highly competitive. The industry is characterized by a large number of small companies manufacturing and selling unbranded merchandise, and by several large companies which have developed widespread consumer recognition of the brand names associated with merchandise manufactured and sold by these companies. In addition, certain of the larger retailers to whom we have historically sold our products have sought to expand the development and marketing of their own brands and to obtain intimate apparel products directly from similar sources as we do. The intimate apparel industry is further characterized by competition on the basis of price, quality, efficient service and prompt delivery. If we do not continue to provide high quality and reliable services on a timely basis at competitive prices, we may not be able to continue to compete in our industry. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose one or more of our significant customers which, if not replaced, could negatively impact our sales and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 7 IF OUR PRODUCT DESIGNS ARE NOT ACCEPTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS OR BY THE RETAIL CONSUMERS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN SALES OR OUR CUSTOMERS COULD EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN SALES, WHICH, IN EITHER EVENT, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. Our operating results could be negatively affected as a result of decreased revenue if our product designs are not accepted by our customers. Also, if our customers purchase our product and do not have success in selling our product at retail, they may request a price adjustment to assist them in marking down the selling price to make the product more attractive to the retail consumer. They, in turn, could then request that we provide them with sales allowances which would reduce our sales revenues. WE OPERATE ON VERY TIGHT DELIVERY SCHEDULES AND IF WE RECEIVE OUR CUSTOMER ORDERS LATE, OR IF THERE ARE DELAYS IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATES IT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. Our customers have been placing their orders in such a manner that the amount of time that we have to source and produce the orders is shorter than it has ever been. If our customers delay the ordering process any more or if there are difficulties during the production process it could create delays in the delivery of the goods. If there is a delay in the delivery of the goods our customers may cancel their orders or request a reduced price for the delivery of their orders. If their orders are canceled, it would leave us in an over-inventoried position and require the sale of inventory at low or negative profits. If customers request a reduced price, it would reduce our profitability. We may also incur extra costs to meet the delivery dates of our customers. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR DISRUPTION OF OUR SUPPLIERS COULD LEAD TO THE REDUCTION IN REVENUE. If we are unable to secure satisfactory manufacturers to produce our orders, it could lead to the loss of revenue. Also, if our manufacturers are late or unable to deliver the goods to us due to unexpected circumstances such as, weather conditions, disruption of the transportation systems or shipping lines used by our suppliers or uncontrollable factors such as terrorism and war, we may experience a reduction in revenue or we may incur additional costs to deliver the orders to our customers, such as shipping goods via air. THE INABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER COULD LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN REVENUE. If we are unable to utilize our distribution center due to unexpected circumstances such as weather conditions, disruption of the transportation systems or uncontrollable factors such as terrorism and war, we may be late or unable to deliver goods to our customers, or we may be forced to incur additional costs to deliver the orders to our customers through alternate channels, which, in either event, would result in a reduction in revenue. WE DEPEND ON OUR KEY PERSONNEL. Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key employees. The loss of the services of any key employee could have a material negative impact on our ability to manage our business successfully. Our success depends upon our ability to retain and attract qualified management, administrative and sales personnel to support our business. Our inability to do so may have a significant negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business. TRANSACTIONS WITH OUR FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD. Our import and offshore operations are subject to constraints imposed by agreements between the United States and a number of foreign countries in which we conduct business. These agreements impose quotas on the amount and type of goods that can be imported into the United States from these countries. Such agreements also allow the United States to impose, at any time, restraints on the importation of categories of merchandise that, under the terms of the agreements, are not subject to specified limits. Our imported products are also subject to United States customs duties and, in the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time subject to claims by the United States Customs Service for duties and other charges. The United States and other countries in which our products are manufactured may, from time to time, impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions, or adversely adjust presently prevailing quotas, duty or tariff levels, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to continue to import products at current or increased levels. 8 THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE (THE "EXCHANGE") MAY DELIST OUR COMMON STOCK FROM QUOTATION ON ITS EXCHANGE. Our common stock is currently listed on the American Stock Exchange. In order to continue the listing of our common stock, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in shareholders' equity (usually between $2 million and $4 million) and a minimum number of public shareholders (usually 300 shareholders or 200,000 shares held by our non-affiliates). Additionally, our common stock cannot have what is deemed to be a "low selling price" as determined by the Exchange. On September 15, 2005 the sale price of our common stock was $0.70. If the Exchange were to determine that this price is a "low selling price," it may require us to effect a reverse split or suspend or remove our common stock from listing on the Exchange. In determining whether a reverse split or suspension or removal is appropriate, the Exchange will consider all pertinent factors including market conditions in general, the number of shares outstanding, plans which may have been formulated by management, applicable regulations of the state or country of incorporation or of any governmental agency having jurisdiction over the company and the relationship to other Exchange policies regarding continued listing. If the Exchange delists our common stock from trading on its exchange, investors could face significant material adverse consequences including: o a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock; o a more limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and o a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future 9
