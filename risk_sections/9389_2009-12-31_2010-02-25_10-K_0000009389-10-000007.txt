Item 1A. Risk Factors Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that the acquisition of certain AB InBev plants, or any other acquisition, will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report for details of the acquisition). While we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans, if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of Ball, we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to: ● demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition; ● the diversion of management’s attention from the management of existing operations to the integration of the acquired operations; ● difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees; ● difficulties in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls (including internal accounting controls), procedures and policies; ● expenses related to any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and ● retention of major customers and suppliers. We may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately. The successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations, realize revenue opportunities and, to some degree, eliminate redundant and excess costs. The loss of a key customer, or a reduction in its requirements, could have a significant negative impact on our sales. We sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage, packaged food and household product companies, some of which operate in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Although the majority of our customer contracts are long-term, these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to meet quality, volume or market pricing requirements. Because we depend on relatively few major customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers' employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers. The primary customers for our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. Our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks, including funding cuts and delays, technical uncertainties, budget changes, competitive activity and changes in scope. We face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability. Competition within the packaging industry is intense. Increases in productivity, combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained competitive pricing pressures. The principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price, service and quality. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours. The global economic environment may result in reductions in demand for our products, which, in turn, could increase these competitive pressures. We are subject to competition from alternative products, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows. Our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products, particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from PET, single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass, cardboard or other materials. Competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the United States, the United Kingdom and the PRC. Certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative solutions. There can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products, which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow. Page 8 of 97 We have a narrow product range, and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2009, 63 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans, and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage cans. Our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage cans decreased. Accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success. If demand for glass and PET bottles increases relative to cans, or the demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations. We and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal, state and provincial laws and regulations. Each of our, and their, plants is subject to federal, state, provincial and local licensing and regulation by health, environmental, workplace safety and other agencies. Requirements of governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing, product content and safety, climate change, workplace safety and health, and environmental and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products. In addition, we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal, state and provincial laws and regulations. Our operations in the U.S. are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, family leave mandates and similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters. The U.S. federal government has proposed sweeping changes to laws affecting the health care of all Americans, including our employees, as well as new or changing laws or regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities that may impact our operations and increase our cost of labor. Significant environmental legislation and regulatory changes are also being considered. The compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and evolving regulations could be substantial, and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from increased international operations. We derived approximately 30 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2009. This sizeable scope of international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business. Reasons for this include, but are not limited to, the following: ● political and economic instability in foreign markets; ● foreign governments' restrictive trade policies; ● the imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties; ● foreign exchange rate risks; ● difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and ● the geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world. Any of these factors, some of which are also present in the U.S., could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Historically, Ball's foreign operations, including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, have been denominated in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect that our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated. As a result, the U.S. dollar value of Ball's foreign operations has varied, and will continue to vary, with exchange rate fluctuations. Ball has been, and is presently, primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Serbian dinar. A decrease in the value of any of these currencies, especially the euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi and Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. Page 9 of 97 We manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, in order to attempt to mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes. We primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and, as a result, we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities. Our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results. Our business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world. We may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to lower prices, exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows. Our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability. If we fail to retain key management and personnel, we may be unable to implement our key objectives. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our experienced management team. Losing the services of key members of our management team could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives. Decreases in our ability to apply new technology and know-how may affect our competitiveness. Our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products, we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales. We manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods. Unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers. In addition, poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers. Climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world. We are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials. We purchase aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources. While all such materials are available from independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations (particularly aluminum on the London Metal Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials. Although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments to manage our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices. Economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers, thereby causing supply shortages. Increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In North America and Europe, some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we use derivative agreements to manage this risk. Our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase. Due to the fixed price contracts and derivative activities, while increasing raw material costs may not impact our near-term profitability, increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time. Prolonged work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial position. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 40 percent of our North American packaging plant employees and most of our packaging plant employees in Europe were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years. Although we consider our employee relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us. Potential legislation has been discussed in the United States, which may, if enacted, facilitate the ability of unions to unionize workers and to establish collective bargaining agreements with employers, including the company. Page 10 of 97 Our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business, including those outlined below. In our aerospace business, existing U.S. government contracts are subject to continued appropriations by Congress and may be terminated or delayed if future funding is not made available. Our backlog includes both cost-type and fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of the work performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees. Our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental hazards, such as emissions to air, discharges to water, the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated us, along with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. There is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide. Net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill. We have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. We are required annually to test the recoverability of goodwill. The recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units. Fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows and discount rates. If general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business, we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units. This decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance, which could materially affect our net earnings and net worth. If the investments in Ball's pension plans do not perform as expected, we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses. Ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its North American and United Kingdom employees, which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions. The plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks, fixed income securities and, in the U.S., alternative investments. Market declines, longevity increases or legislative changes, such as the Pension Protection Act in the U.S., could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time, and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders' equity. Restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures. On December 31, 2009, we had total debt of $2.6 billion and unused committed credit lines in excess of $600 million. A reduction of financial liquidity could have important consequences, including the following: ● restrict our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities; ● increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment; ● limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; ● restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; and ● limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities. In addition, more than one third of our debt bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. While we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk. Page 11 of 97 Changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, could materially impact our reported results. U.S. GAAP and SEC accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past few years. These changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods. Additionally, material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate Ball. The material changes in net earnings and/or presentation of transactions could impact our credit rating and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner. The global credit, financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The global credit, financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations, including, but not limited to, the following: ● the creditworthiness of customers, suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials; ● volatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets, potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain prescribed funding levels; ● a significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants; and ● reduced cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our long-term strategy to increase liquidity, reduce debt, repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses.
