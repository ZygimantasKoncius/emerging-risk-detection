D. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We may not be able to commercialize our product candidates in development for numerous reasons.” 78 We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates, if any, will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements. Selling and Marketing Expenses In the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $2.1 million of selling and marketing expenses, compared to $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $0.2 million, or approximately 13.3%. This increase was primarily due to a $0.1 million increase of regulatory fees and a $0.1 million increase of freight. Selling and marketing expenses accounted for approximately 3.0% and 2.5% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

This increase was primarily due to a one-time management compensation payment of $1.4 million associated with the successful U.S. initial public offering, a $0.5 million write-off of receivables in India for doubtful debt, an increase of $0.2 million for external consultants expenses and accounting services associated with being a public company in the U.S. and an increase of $0.5 million in wages.

This decrease was primarily due to lower interest on short term investments. Expense in respect of exchange and translation differences and derivatives instruments In the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $0.4 million of expenses in respect of currency exchange differences on balances in other currencies versus the U.S. dollar compared to $0.1 million of income in respect of translation and currency exchange differences and derivatives in the year ended December 31, 2012.

Taxes on Income In the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $24,000 of taxes on income from deferred tax assets, compared to $0.5 million incurred in the year ended December 31, 2012.

Historically, we have funded our operations primarily through cash flow from operations, payments received in connection with strategic partnerships and the issuance of convertible debentures, warrants to purchase our ordinary shares and other equity securities. The balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $51.9 million, $74.1 million and $33.0 million, respectively. We have certain strategic partnership and distribution agreements under which we receive payments for the achievement of certain milestones. As of December 31, 2014, we received an aggregate of $40.5 million in payments under these agreements, and there are $64.5 million in payments under these agreements that we could potentially receive if we achieve the milestones set forth in such agreements.
