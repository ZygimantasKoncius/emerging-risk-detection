Item 1a. Risk Factors contained herein, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEarnings ReviewNoninterest Income and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 and Note 6 all contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys accounting policies related to, factors impacting, and methodology for analyzing the Companys mortgage-servicing right portfolio. The Companys accounting for its mortgage-servicing right portfolio represents another accounting estimate heavily dependent on current economic conditions, especially the interest rate environment, and managements judgments. The Company utilizes the expertise of a third party consultant to assess the portfolios value including, but not limited to, capitalization, impairment, and amortization rates. The consultant utilizes estimates for the amount and timing of estimated prepayment rates, credit loss experience, costs to service loans, and discount rates to determine an estimate of the fair market value of the Companys mortgage-servicing right portfolio. Management believes that the modeling techniques and assumptions used by the consultant are reasonable. Future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in factors noted above as well as those noted within Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward Looking Statements which discusses mortgage-banking income. Although growth through acquisition is not a strategic growth initiative of the Company, historically, the Company has increased its market share through bank acquisitions (the last of these acquisitions occurred in 1999). These acquisitions resulted in goodwill or other intangible assets that are subject to periodic impairment testing in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Such impairment testing calculations, performed by the Company as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, include estimates. Furthermore, the determination of which intangible assets have finite lives is subjective as is the determination of the amortization period for such intangible assets. The Company tests for goodwill impairment by determining the fair market value for each reporting unit and comparing the fair market value to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair market value, the potential for impairment exists, and a second step of impairment testing is performed. In the second step, the fair market value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair market value to all of its assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. If the implied fair market value of reporting unit goodwill is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and is written-down to its fair market value. The Companys impairment testing as of June 30, 2005 indicated that no impairment charge was required as of that date, however, there can be no assurance that future events and circumstances will not change these determination and adversely impact the results of operations of the Company. No such events or circumstances have come to managements attention since its June 30, 2005 testing. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys accounting policies related to its intangible assets. Management uses assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently for book and tax purposes, and income tax expense. Determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Management exercises judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments and estimates are reevaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. No assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by the Company or the income tax reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements will not be adjusted by adverse rulings by the United States Tax Court, changes in the tax code, or assessments made by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company is subject to potential adverse adjustments, including, but not limited to, 25 Table of Contents an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates, the permanent nondeductibility of amounts currently considered deductible either now or in future periods, and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income, including capital gains, in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets. Historically, the Companys estimated income taxes have been materially correct. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 and Note 12 all contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies impacting the Companys income taxes as well as discussion regarding the Companys current period income tax expense and future tax liabilities associated with differences in the timing of expense and income recognition for book and tax accounting purposes. During fiscal year 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) conducted an audit of the Companys 2003 federal income tax return. Material adjustments reported by the IRS with regard to the audit were timing issues and did not result in the additional payment of taxes by the Company. The Company did incur interest on the adjustments for the periods over which the timing differences related, but no penalties were incurred. The Company does not believe that the adjustments were the result of incorrect assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable for the current year or deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently for book and tax purposes. Instead, it believes the adjustments to be the result of misinterpretation of tax law and regulations. The results of the audit did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Company Overview The Companys primary market area is located within Upstate, South Carolina. Primary business sectors in the region include banking and finance, manufacturing, health care, retail, telecommunications, government services, and education. The Company believes that it is not dependent on any one or a few types of commerce due to the areas diverse economic base. The Upstate is a designated foreign trade zone area that boasts the highest level of foreign capital investment per capita in the nation. As such, the area is home to international firms including BMW, Hitachi, and Michelin. The Company believes that the Upstate, having recently annexed more than 724 acres of prime development property, has the potential to attract new industry. Along with the creation of the Millennium Campus and an automotive research park at the site, part of a joint venture between Clemson University and BMW, the Company believes that developers are ready to bring many new industries to the area. The Bank opened its Easley banking office during the third quarter of 2005 facilitating the Banks expansion into Pickens County in Upstate, South Carolina. During the fourth quarter of 2005, as a result of changing traffic patterns and the encroachment of the highway on the Companys East Blackstock Road banking office premises, the Bank moved that banking office in Spartanburg, South Carolina to W.O. Ezell Boulevard in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The Bank anticipates the opening of a new banking office in Boiling Springs, South Carolina during the fourth quarter of 2006. Management continually reviews opportunities for Upstate expansion that are believed to be in the best interest of the Company, its customers, and its shareholders. In addition to traditional banking services, the Company offers brokerage and trust services. Traditional banking services include the Banks retail and commercial distribution network of 31 banking offices, telephone banking, and Internet banking, and, in addition, the Bank provides a variety of depository accounts including, but not limited to, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking, savings, certificate of deposit, and money market accounts. In addition, the Bank offers a variety of loan products, including, but not limited to, commercial, installment, real estate, and home equity loans as well as credit card services. The Bank also maintains 32 ATMs and allows customers to access their accounts online. The Banks mortgage-banking operations provide both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage products and loan servicing. Mortgage lenders are located in the banking offices. The Companys trust department offers trust services for companies and individuals, and Palmetto Capital offers full service and discount brokerage, annuity sales and financial planning services through a third party arrangement with Raymond James. Investment advisors are located in banking 26 Table of Contents office locations. In addition, the Company maintains separate investment locations in Greenville and Laurens Counties. Trust professionals are located in banking office locations and the Companys operations center. Improving the net interest margin is critical to the Companys strategy to grow earnings. The Company derives interest income through traditional banking services including interest income earned on loans and investment securities. The Company generates noninterest income through fees charged on deposit accounts and income generated through the Companys mortgage-banking, brokerage, and trust services. Lowering funding costs is essential to improving the Companys net interest margin. During 2005, the Company continued its focus on growing deposit balances while remaining cognizant of pricing dilemmas resulting from the recent increasing interest rate environment. In addition to traditional deposit funding sources, the Company utilizes borrowings to support interest-earning asset growth including, but not limited to, increases in investment securities. Although often obtained at rates higher than those of traditional deposit funding sources, borrowings represent a source of funding diversification that can be used for leverage in deposit pricing. In addition, borrowings help an institution avoid overpaying for deposits. Among other tools, the Company uses marginal cost analysis when considering funding options. Management believes that marginal cost analysis is the key to incorporating borrowings in deposit pricing. Although alternative funding sources do not always result in lower interest expense, management believes that such funding alternatives can increase the Companys net interest income by employing these funds in higher yielding interest-earning assets. Since asset quality is tied to many key performance indicators including, but not limited to, profitability and capital adequacy, maintaining sound asset quality continues to be a primary focus for the Company. Activities designed to monitor and improve asset quality typically have a positive impact on operations by reducing the credit risk profile of the Company and reducing future collection costs. Nevertheless, certain risks are inherent within any loan portfolio particularly portfolios containing commercial, commercial real estate, and installment loans, and these risks must be continually managed. Management monitors asset quality and credit risk on an ongoing basis. The Company is focused on retaining existing and attracting new customers and feels that it sets itself apart from its competitors by providing superior customer service. Such service is accomplished through a variety of delivery channels marketing a full range of high quality financial products and services. The Company sets targets for growth in traditional deposit accounts annually in an effort to cross sell and increase the number of products per banking relationship. The Company uses traditional marketing techniques, such as direct mailings and advertising, to attract new customers as the Company recognizes that attracting new customers provides both interest opportunities and a new avenue for the generation of fee income. In addition, new deposit customers are key to providing a mix of lower-cost funding sources. To meet the convenience needs of existing and potential customers, the Company offers extended weekday hours at banking offices, Saturday banking at select banking offices, a call center, and Internet banking options. The Company intends to continue to expand into new areas as both market and economic conditions warrant. Financial Condition Overview At December 31, 2005, the Companys assets totaled $1.075 billion, an increase of $81.9 million or 8.3% over December 31, 2004. The increase in assets during fiscal year 2005 resulted primarily from an increase in total loans of $91.9 million partially offset by a decline in investment securities available for sale of $17.7 million, or 12.3%. Average assets increased 11.9% during the year, and average interest-earning assets increased 12.1%. Total liabilities increased $73.7 million, or 8.1%, at December 31, 2005 over December 31, 2004, to a balance of $986.1 million. This increase resulted from an increase in traditional deposits of $75.9 million, or 9.2%, an increase in retail repurchase agreements totaling $331 thousand, or 2.0%, and an increase in commercial paper of $864 thousand, or 5.1%. Offsetting these increases was a decline federal funds purchased and FHLB borrowings of $5.1 million over the same periods. Total deposits and other borrowings totaled $978.9 million at December 31, 2005, up from $906.9 million at December 31, 2004. Total shareholders equity at December 31, 2005 totaled $88.9 million, an increase of $8.2 million, or 10.1%, over December 31, 2004. 27 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004, the Companys assets totaled $993.1 million, an increase of $97.7 million or 10.9% over December 31, 2003. The increase in assets during fiscal year 2004 resulted primarily from an increase in total loans of $79.5 million, an increase in investments available for sale of $14.8 million, or 11.5%, and an increase in FHLB capital stock of $2.0 million, or 107.0%. Average assets increased 9.0% during the year, and average interest-earning assets increased 9.1%. Total liabilities increased $89.0 million, or 10.8%, at December 31, 2004 over December 31, 2003, to a balance of $912.3 million. This increase resulted from an increase in traditional deposits of $55.7 million, or 7.2%, an increase in retail repurchase agreements totaling $2.9 million, or 21.2%, and an increase in commercial paper of $881 thousand, or 5.4%. In addition to these increases, other borrowings, comprised of federal funds purchased and FHLB borrowings, increased by $28.0 million over the same periods. Total deposits and other borrowings totaled $906.9 million at December 31, 2004, up from $819.4 million at December 31, 2003. Total shareholders equity at December 31, 2004 totaled $80.8 million, an increase of $8.8 million, or 12.2%, over December 31, 2003. FHLB Stock At December 31, 2005, the Banks investment in FHLB stock remained relatively unchanged from the investment at December 31, 2004. As a member of the FHLB System, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the FHLB. Under the FHLBs capital structure, a members stock requirement must total an amount equal to the sum of a membership requirement and an activity-based requirement as described in the FHLBs Capital Plan. The Banks investment at December 31, 2005 was in compliance with this requirement. No ready market exists for this stock, and it has no quoted market value. However, redemption of this stock has historically been at par value. Therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair market value. See Item 1. BusinessSupervision and RegulationSupervision and Regulation of the BankFederal Home Loan Bank System contained herein for further discussion regarding the Banks membership with the FHLB. Investment Securities Available for Sale The investment securities portfolio, all of which was classified as available for sale at December 31, 2005, is a component of the Companys asset-liability management strategy. Investment securities available for sale are accounted for at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Shareholders Equity. The Company employs a third party to determine the fair market value of the securities portfolio. Fair market value is determined as of the date of the end of the reporting period based on available quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar securities if a quoted market price is not available. The primary objective of the Companys management of the investment portfolio is to maintain a portfolio of high quality, highly liquid investments yielding competitive returns. The Company achieves these objectives by executing investment transactions that are approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company is required under federal regulations to maintain adequate liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. Investment decisions are made by authorized officers of the Company within policies established by the Companys Board of Directors. The Company maintains investment balances based on a continuing assessment of cash flows, the level of loan production, current interest rate risk strategies, and the assessment of the potential future direction of market interest rate changes. Investment securities differ in terms of default risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and expected rate of return. Default risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to make interest payments or to repay the principal amount on schedule. United States (U.S.) Government obligations are regarded as free of default risk as the issuances of most Government agencies are backed by the strength of the government agency itself. In addition, in the event of financial difficulty, there is a strong implication that the federal government would assist the agency. 28 Table of Contents Investment securities available for sale totaled $126.0 million at December 31, 2005, a decrease of $17.7 million, or 12.3%, when compared with December 31, 2004. Average balances of available for sale investment securities decreased to $132.7 million during fiscal year 2005 from $134.9 million during fiscal year 2004. The following table summarizes the composition of the Companys investment securities available for sale portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Total % of Total Total % of Total U.S. Government agencies $ 49,960 39.7 % 10,021 7.0 State and municipal 56,006 44.4 69,496 48.3 Mortgage-backed 20,022 15.9 64,216 44.7 Total investment securities available for sale $ 125,988 100.0 % 143,733 100.0 From December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005, the investment securities portfolio experienced a 69% decline in mortgage-backed securities, a 19% decline in state and municipal securities, and an increase of 399% in U.S. Government agency securities. The shift in composition within the portfolio resulted from the Companys goal of having an investment securities portfolio concentrated on total return as funds from the sale of mortgage-backed securities were reinvested into agency securities that the Company believes have a better total return profile at the time of execution. At December 31, 2005, the investment security portfolio represented 11.7% of total assets, a decline from 14.5% at December 31, 2004. The decline in the total investment securities portfolio of approximately 12% from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from mortgage-backed security prepayment and paydown funds being used to fund the Companys loan portfolio growth.

Loans represent the most significant component of the Companys interest-earning assets with average loans accounting for 85.2% and 83.7% of average interest-earning assets in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company strives to maintain a diversified loan portfolio in an effort to spread risk and reduce exposure to economic downturns that may occur within different segments of the economy, geographic locations, or in particular industries. Although the Company may originate loans outside of its market area, the Company originates the majority of its loans in its primary market area of Upstate, South Carolina.

While these types of loans provide benefits to the Companys assetliability management program and reduce exposure to interest rate changes, such loans may entail additional credit risks when compared with residential mortgage loans. Risk factors inherent in the Companys loan portfolio are described below and could have an impact on future delinquency and charge-off levels. Since lending activities comprise a significant source of the Companys revenues and because of the risks inherent in its loan portfolio, the Companys main objective with regard to its lending activities is to adhere to sound lending practices. Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than real estate lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with real estate lending. The Companys commercial business loans are generally made on a secured basis with terms that do not exceed five years. Such loans typically have interest rates that change at periods ranging from one day to one year based on the prime lending rate as the interest rate index or to a fixed-rate at the time of commitment for a period not usually exceeding five years. The Company generally obtains personal guarantees when arranging business financing. The Company makes commercial business loans to businesses within most industry sectors with no particular industry concentrations. Although commercial loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in some cases may not be a sufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors) while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment. Real estate acquisition and development lending is generally considered to be collateral-based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan-to-collateral values. For loans secured by real estate, liquidation of the underlying collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Commercial and installment real estate lending generally involves greater risk than single-family lending as such real estate lending typically involves larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers than does single-family lending. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrowers ability to repay the Companys loans may be impaired. These risks can be impacted significantly by supply and demand in the market for the type of property securing the loan and by general economic conditions. Thus, commercial and installment real estate loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the economy, to a 31 Table of Contents greater extent than single-family real estate loans. The Company makes commercial and installment real estate loans to businesses within most industry sectors with no particular industry concentrations. Interest rates charged on such real estate loans are determined by market conditions existing at the time of the loan commitment. Generally, loans have adjustable-rates, and the rate may be fixed for three to five years determined by market conditions, collateral, and the Companys relationship with the borrower. Amortization of commercial and installment real estate loans may vary but typically will not exceed 20 years. Installment loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted installment loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the likelihood of damage, loss, or depreciation. In addition, installment loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and are more likely to be adversely impacted by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. The application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that the Company can recover on such loans. The Companys indirect lending department establishes relationships with Upstate automobile dealers to provide customer financing on qualifying automobile purchases. Through these relationships, the Company purchases loans originated by unaffiliated automobile dealers in South Carolina. Loans purchased by this department are subject to the same underwriting standards as those used by the Company in its other lending portfolios, and such loans are only purchased after approval by the Companys underwriters. The Company makes both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with terms generally ranging from 10 to 30 years. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans currently offered by the Company have up to 30 year terms with interest rates that adjust annually or adjust annually after being fixed for a period of several years in accordance with a designated index. The Company could offer loans that have up to 30 year terms and interest rates that adjust annually or adjust annually after being fixed for a period of three or seven years in accordance with a designated index. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans may be originated with a limit on any increase or decrease in the interest rate per year further limited by the amount by which the interest rate can increase or decrease over the life of the loan. In order to encourage the origination of adjustable-rate mortgage loans with interest rates that adjust annually, the Company, like many of its competitors, may offer a more attractive rate of interest on such loans than on fixed-rate mortgage loans. Generally, on mortgage loans exceeding an 80% loan-to-value ratio, the Company requires private mortgage insurance that protects the Company against losses of at least 20% of the mortgage loan amount. It is the Companys policy to have collateral securing real estate loans appraised. A large percentage of single-family loans are made pursuant to guidelines that permit the sale of these loans in the secondary market to government or private agencies. The Company participates in secondary market activities by selling whole loans and participations in loans primarily to the FHLB under its Mortgage Partnership Program and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). This practice enables the Company to satisfy the demand for these loans in its local communities, to meet asset and liability objectives of management, and to develop a source of fee income through the servicing of loans. The Company may sell fixed-rate, adjustable-rate, and balloon-term loans. Based on the current level on market interest rates, as well as other factors, the Company presently intends to sell selected originations of conforming 30 year and 15 year fixed-rate mortgage loans. The Company originates residential construction loans to finance the construction of individual, owner-occupied houses. Such loans involve additional risks because loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction. Residential construction loans are generally originated with up to 80% loan-to-value ratios. The Company typically structures these construction loans to be converted to pre-approved permanent loans at the completion of the construction phase. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant. As part of its residential lending program, the Company also offers construction loans with 80% loan-to-value ratios to qualified builders although 90% loan-to-value ratios may be utilized at the discretion of 32 Table of Contents the Company. These construction loans are generally at a competitive fixed or adjustable-rate of interest for one or two year terms. The Company also offers lot loans intended for residential use that may be on a fixed or adjustable-rate basis. At December 31, 2005, the Companys total loan portfolio approximated $871.0 million, or 81.0% of the Companys total assets. Mortgage loans held for sale decreased $1.0 million from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. The remaining loans within the portfolio (those originated for retention in the portfolio) increased $92.9 million at December 31, 2005 over December 31, 2004. A large portion of the increase in the loan portfolio during fiscal year 2005 was experienced within the commercial real estate portfolio. This increase was due in part to managements emphasis on loans secured by real estate as loans secured by real estate typically include less risk than loans secured by collateral other than real estate or unsecured loans. Management believes that the Company has capitalized on commercial real estate opportunities in its market. From December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005, the commercial real estate portfolio grew by $82.6 million, or 17.3%. During fiscal year 2005, the Companys indirect lending portfolio increased by $14.1 million, or 86.1%. Management attributes this indirect loan growth to a new program offered by the Company that targets high credit scoring consumers at competitive rates. The goal of this program is to introduce the Company and its products to reputable automobile dealers. Once introduced, the Companys goal is to continue to build and maintain relationships with these dealers and their customers. The prime access lending portfolio increased approximately $8.6 million during 2005 primarily as a result of the Companys ongoing competitive closing cost marketing efforts. The residential mortgage loan portfolio decreased $18.2 million, or 34.6%, during 2005. Residential mortgage loan originations during this period were offset by prepayments and maturities. Also offsetting originations during 2005 was a loan securitization and sale transaction during June 2005 totaling approximately $14 million. Through this transaction, the Company securitized and sold approximately $10 million of its residential mortgage loans. The goal of this securitization was to provide enhanced liquidity, to improve capital ratios, and to provide growth in revenues from mortgage-servicing activities. In addition, approximately $4 million of residential mortgage loans were sold during June 2005 from the loans receivable portfolio. The following table summarizes the Companys loan portfolio outstanding, by collateral type, at December 31, 2005 that, based on maturity and repricing terms, are due during the periods noted. Loans having no stated maturity and no stated schedule of repayments are reported as due in one year or less.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4 also contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys loan portfolio. Credit Quality. A willingness to take credit risk is inherent in the decision to grant credit. Prudent risk taking requires a management system based on sound policies and control processes that ensure compliance with those policies. The Company believes that it maintains a conservative philosophy regarding its lending mix and adherence to underwriting standards is managed through a multi-layered credit approval process including, but not limited to, the review of loans approved by lenders. The Company monitors its compliance with lending policies through loan approval and documentation review, exception report reviews, and ongoing analysis of asset quality trends. The following table summarizes the loan classification system used by the Company with regard to its loan portfolio. The Company considers classified assets to be those classified as special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss. Grade Classification 1 Superior quality 2 High quality 3 Satisfactory 4 Marginal 5 Special Mention 6 Substandard 7 Doubtful 8 Loss Special mention assets are defined by the Company as assets that do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification as either substandard, doubtful, or loss. Such assets do, however, possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving managements close attention that, if not corrected, could weaken the asset and increase future risk. An asset is considered substandard if inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Classified assets are reserved at a higher percentage in accordance with the Allowance model than assets graded superior quality, high quality, satisfactory, or marginal (for all of which general reserves are provided). General allowances represent loss allowances, which have been established to recognize the inherent risks associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular classified assets. When the Company classifies assets as loss, it is required to either establish a specific allowance for loan losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. 34 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the composition of the Companys classified assets by collateral type at the dates indicated (in thousands). December 31, 2005 Specialmention Substandard Doubtful Loss Total Commercial and industrial $ 230 2,925 851  4,006 Real estate1 - 4 family 1,147 4,023 239  5,409 Real estateconstruction      Real estateother 82 11,400 58  11,540 General consumer 25 287 68  380 Credit line 6 54 1 1 62 Total classified assets $ 1,490 18,689 1,217 1 21,397 December 31, 2004 Specialmention Substandard Doubtful Loss Total Commercial and industrial $ 131 4,448 857  5,436 Real estate1 - 4 family 1,327 3,229 333  4,889 Real estateconstruction  22   22 Real estateother 1,635 2,342 214  4,191 General consumer 107 491 175  773 Credit line 9 37 3 1 50 Total classified assets $ 3,209 10,569 1,582 1 15,361 Overall, classified assets increased $6.0 million from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. From a portfolio perspective, an increase was experienced in classified assets secured by real estate offset by declines in classified assets secured by commercial, industrial, and general consumer collateral. From a classification perspective, an increase was experienced in substandard assets while declines were experienced in both the special mention and doubtful classification. Management believes that the increase in classified assets, from both the portfolio and classification perspectives, at December 31, 2005 over December 31, 2004 does not indicate a deterioration of asset quality as the increase can be attributed, for the most part, to isolated loan circumstances. During the fourth quarter of 2005, two loans, both of which were secured by other real estate, were placed in nonaccrual status. In accordance with the Banks Lending Policy, the loans were downgraded to substandard. At December 31, 2005, the principal balance of these loans totaled $7.2 million. Management believes the collateral securing these loans is sufficient to cover the Banks exposure. Payment was received in January 2006 on one of these loans (balance of $3.3 million at December 31, 2005) that warranted the removal of nonaccrual status at that time. Excluding the impact of these loans, virtually all other comparisons, whether from a portfolio or classification perspective, improved from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. Management believes that the general overall improvement of classified assets, after taking into account these circumstances, resulted from the continued improvement in economic conditions coupled with managements conservative approach to, and management of, loan quality. The Companys loan portfolio is periodically reviewed and loans are, in the opinion of management, appropriately classified. Allowances have been established against all assets requiring classification. 35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes trends in problem assets and other asset quality indicators at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Nonaccrual loans $ 9,913 2,323 3,828 2,500 3,399 Total nonperforming loans $ 9,913 2,323 3,828 2,500 3,399 Real estate acquired in settlement of loans 1,954 2,413 2,170 2,468 217 Repossessed automobiles 167 282 243 181 581 Total nonperforming assets $ 12,034 5,018 6,241 5,149 4,197 Loans past due 90 days and still accruing (1) $ 207 147 212 233 630 Ending loans (2) 866,181 773,254 693,213 625,542 553,821 Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans (2) 1.14 % 0.30 0.55 0.40 0.61 Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets 1.12 0.51 0.70 0.63 0.57 Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans 0.85 x 3.28 1.95 2.56 1.66 (1) Substantially all of these loans are bankcard loans (2) Calculated using loans excluding mortgage loans held for sale, net of unearned, excluding the Allowance Delinquent and problem loans are a normal part of any lending function. The Company determines past due and delinquency status based on contractual terms. When a borrower fails to make a scheduled loan payment, the Company attempts to cure the default through several methods including, but not limited to, collection contact and assessment of late fees. If these methods do not result in the borrower submitting the past due payment, further action may be taken. Interest on loans deemed past due continues to accrue until such time that the loan is placed in nonaccrual status (the Company places loans in nonaccrual status prior to any amount being charged-off). Nonaccrual loans are those loans that management, through a continuing evaluation of loans, has determined offer a more than normal risk of future collectibility. In most cases, loans are automatically placed in nonaccrual status by the loan system when the loan payment becomes 90 days delinquent and no acceptable arrangement has been made between the Company and the borrower. Loans may be manually placed in nonaccrual status on the loan system if management determines that some factor other than delinquency (such as bankruptcy proceedings) cause the Company to believe that more than a normal amount of risk exists with regard to collectibility. When the loan is placed in nonaccrual status, accrued interest income is reversed based on the effective date of nonaccrual status. Thereafter, interest income on the nonaccrual loans is recognized only as received. When the probability of future collectibility on a nonaccrual loan declines from probable to possible, the Company may proceed with measures to remedy the default, including commencing foreclosure action, if necessary. Mortgage instruments generally secure loans within the Companys mortgage loan portfolio and specific steps must be taken when commencing foreclosure action on such loans. Notice of default in conjunction with these loans is required to be recorded and mailed. If the default is not cured within a specified time period, a notice of sale is posted, mailed, and advertised, and a sale is then conducted. The Company typically excludes bankcard balances from the nonaccrual process noted above. Due to the nature of the portfolio, the Company does not believe that it is necessarily probable that collectibility of these loans is remote when delinquencies exceed 90 days. For this reason, these balances often continue to accrue income after they have become greater than 90 days delinquent. The increase in nonaccrual loans of $7.6 million from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of the two loans, secured by other real estate, which were placed in nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2005 as discussed previously in conjunction with the increase in classified loans over the same periods. Management believes that the loss risk with respect to nonaccrual loans was reduced from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 because 92.5% of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2005 were secured by real 36 Table of Contents estate as compared to 73.4% at December 31, 2004. In addition to such loans being reserved for in the Companys Allowance at December 31, 2005, in the event of foreclosure, losses would be offset by funds received through the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral. Additionally, nonaccrual loans secured by property other than real estate declined from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 from 26.6% to 7.5%. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLoan Portfolio, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4 all contained herein for further discussion regarding loans in nonaccrual status. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies with regard to loans in nonaccrual status. Real estate and personal property acquired by the Company in settlement of loans is classified within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until such time that it is sold. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair market value less cost to sell at the date of acquisition with any resulting writedowns being taken through the Allowance. Fair market values of such property are reviewed regularly, and writedowns are recorded when it is determined that the carrying value of the property exceeds the fair market value less estimated costs to sell. Gains and losses on the sale of property acquired in settlement of loans and writedowns resulting from periodic reevaluation are charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income. Costs relating to the development and improvement of such property are capitalized within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs relating to holding the property are charged to expense within Other Noninterest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Generally, any interest accrual on such loans would have ceased when the loan became 90 days delinquent. Real estate acquired in settlement of loans decreased to $2.0 million at December 31, 2005 from $2.4 million at December 31, 2004. During 2005, $1.1 million in real estate was added to the portfolio, 65% of which was added within four lending relationships. These additions were offset by sales and recoveries from the portfolio of $1.3 million. During 2004, $2.5 million in real estate was added to the portfolio, 65% of which was added within six lending relationships. These additions were offset by sales from the portfolio of $2.0 million. Fluctuations of these balances relate primarily to current economic conditions that directly impact the borrowers ability to service their debt. Management believes that the decrease in property added to the portfolio during 2005 was a direct reflection of continued general economic improvement gauged by factors including, but not limited to, consumer expectations, real money supply, a decline in initial unemployment claims, interest rate conditions, and manufacturing new orders. Likewise, sales and recoveries from the portfolio decreased from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 and relationships within the portfolio declined from 26 at December 31, 2004 to 20 at December 31, 2005. Based on the Companys policies and procedures regarding the regular review of fair market values of real estate acquired in settlement of loans and writedowns taken accordingly, management believes that the properties within the portfolio were properly valued at December 31, 2005. Additionally, management believes that the excess of sales from the portfolio during fiscal year 2005 over additions during the same timeframe indicate that the properties within the portfolio are marketable. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies with regard to real estate acquired in settlement of loans and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8 also contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys real estate acquired in settlement of loans portfolio. At December 31, 2005, impaired loans amounted to approximately $7.4 million for which $670 thousand was included in the Allowance. During 2005, the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $4.1 million. At December 31, 2004, impaired loans amounted to approximately $804 thousand for which $240 thousand was included in the Allowance. During 2004, the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $1.1 million. The increase in impaired loans from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from the addition of two impaired loans totaling $7.2 million at 37 Table of Contents December 31, 2005 as discussed above in conjunction with classified assets and nonaccrual loans. Management believes that the impaired loans at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were recorded at or below fair market value. Because impaired loans are generally classified as nonaccrual, no interest income is recognized on such loans subsequent to being placed in nonaccrual status. The Company reviewed impaired loans at December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended by SFAS No. 118, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-Income Recognition and Disclosuresan amendment of FASB Statement No. 114, and determined fair market values based on one, or a combination of, the following methods: the present value of expected cash flows, the market price of the loan, if available, and / or the value of the underlying collateral. Specific allowances, as noted above, were established on impaired loans for the difference between the loan amount and the fair market value less estimated selling costs. Two loans comprised $7.2 million of total impaired loans at December 31, 2005. In both of these instances, the value of the collateral underlying the loan, as well as the marketability of such collateral, supported specific allowances totaling $621 thousand. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies with regard to impaired loans and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4 also contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys impaired loans. As of December 31, 2005, management was aware of no potential problem loans that were not already categorized as nonaccrual, past due, or restructured, that had borrower credit problems causing management to have serious doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms. SFAS No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings, establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting by the debtor and by the creditor for a troubled debt restructuring. Additionally, it requires that adjustments in payment terms from a troubled debt restructuring generally be considered adjustments of the yield (effective interest rate) of the loan. So long as the aggregate payments (both principal and interest) to be received by the creditor are not less than the creditors carrying amount of the loan, the creditor recognizes no loss, but instead recognizes a lower yield over the term of the restructured debt. Similarly, the debtor recognizes no gain unless the aggregate future payments (including amounts contingently payable) are less than the debtors recorded liability. Troubled debt restructurings include loans with respect to which the Company has agreed to modifications of the terms of the loan such as changes in the interest rate charged and / or other concessions. Any troubled debt restructurings entered into by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 were immaterial when considered individually, or in the aggregate, with regard to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that recent economic conditions have had a short-term impact on consumer confidence, especially on consumer expectations. Though consumer confidence appears to be improved from levels in recent years, management believes that high fuel costs, though they have retreated in recent weeks, combined with a weaker job market outlook will likely continue to curb both consumer confidence and spending for the short-term. As rebuilding efforts take hold and job growth gains momentum, management believes that consumer confidence will continue to rebound during 2006. Management believes, however, that because the Companys loan portfolio is closely monitored, any changes within the Companys loan portfolio are promptly addressed in its Allowance model. Additionally, management believes that there will always remain a core level of delinquent loans and real estate and personal property acquired in settlement of loans from normal lending operations. Allowance for Loan Losses The Allowance is maintained at a level that management believes is sufficient to cover losses in the loan portfolio at a specific point in time. Assessing the adequacy of the Allowance requires considerable judgment. The adequacy of the Allowance is analyzed on a monthly basis using an internal analysis model. For purposes of this analysis, adequacy is defined as a level sufficient to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. An allowance model is used that takes into account factors such as the composition of the loan portfolio including 38 Table of Contents risk grade classifications, historical asset quality trends including, but not limited to, previous loss experience ratios, managements assessment of current economic conditions, and reviews of specific high risk sectors of the portfolio. Loans are graded at inception and are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that assigned risk grades are proper based on the classifications. The value of underlying collateral is also considered during such analysis. On a quarterly basis, the Companys Allowance model and conclusions are reviewed and approved by senior management. The Companys analysis of Allowance adequacy includes consideration for loan impairment. The methodology for assessing the adequacy of the Allowance establishes both an allocated and unallocated component of the contra asset balance. The allocated component is based principally on current loan grades and historical loss rates. Management is currently using a five year lookback period when computing historical loss rates to determine the allocated component of the Allowance. The unallocated component is the result of the portion of the assessment that estimates probable losses in the portfolio that are not fully captured in the allocated Allowance. This analysis includes, but is not limited to, emerging portfolio concentrations, recently entered markets, model imprecision, and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on historical loss rates. On a continual basis, management monitors trends within the portfolio, both quantitative and qualitative, and assesses the reasonableness of the unallocated component. The Allowance is subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies. Such regulatory agencies could require Allowance adjustments based on information available to them at the time of their examination. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies with regard to the Allowance. The Allowance totaled $8.4 million and $7.6 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively representing 0.97% and 0.99% of loans, calculated using loans excluding mortgage loans held for sale, net of unearned income, excluding allowance for loan losses. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value. The fair market value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on prices for outstanding commitments to sell these loans. Typically, the carrying amount approximates fair market value due to the Companys practice of selling these loans within 60 days of origination. Likewise, such instruments are not included in the assumptions related to the Allowance model. The following table summarizes the allocation of the Allowance and the percentage of loans to total loans, excluding net of unearned balances, both by collateral type, at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). Management believes that the Allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the Allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the Allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

The increase in allocation of the Allowance to the portfolio secured by other real estate was due, in large part, to two loans in nonaccrual status at December 31, 2005, as discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLoan Portfolio, both of which were secured by other real estate. As such, the loans were downgraded to substandard in accordance with the Banks Lending Policy. Such downgrades resulted in increased Allowance coverage. At December 31, 2005, the principal balance of these loans totaled $7.2 million. The increase in allocation of the Allowance to the loan portfolio secured by general consumer collateral was due, in part, to the increase in the indirect lending portfolio at December 31, 2005 over December 31, 2004 as well as an increase in the potential historical loss percentage with regard to this category. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEarnings ReviewProvision for Loan Losses contained herein for discussion regarding the increase in the provision for loan losses from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005. 40 Table of Contents Total net loans charged-off totaled $1.6 million in fiscal year 2005 down from $2.0 million in fiscal year 2004. When comparing net loans charged-off during fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2005, declines were experienced in all portfolios with the exception of the portfolio secured by residential real estate. Although management attributes the decline in net loans charged-off to the careful management of the Companys loan portfolio and the resulting impact such management has had on asset quality as well as overall economic improvements that generally increase the likelihood of consumer repayment of debt, management believes that the increase in net loans charged-off within the portfolio secured by residential real estate was caused by economic conditions that have been not as favorable since the third quarter of 2001. Although levels of both classified assets and nonaccrual loans increased from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005, management believes that these increases were not necessarily the result of deterioration in asset quality. Instead, management believes that such trends are the result of isolated events that are not necessarily indicative of historical or future credit trends. The level of the Allowance during fiscal year 2005 was also impacted by growth within the loan portfolio during the period. Management believes that the declining trend of the Allowance to ending loans results from several factors including, but not limited to, managements conservative philosophy regarding its lending mix which impact risk grades assigned at loan origination, the ongoing management of asset quality, and growth within the portfolio being primarily loans secured by real estate which generally involve less risk that other types of lending also impacting risk grades, all of which impact Allowance allocations. Based on the current economic environment and other factors that impact the assessment of the Companys Allowance as discussed above, management believes that the Allowance at December 31, 2005 was maintained at a level adequate to provide for estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLoan Portfolio contained herein for discussion regarding factors inherent in the loan portfolio impacting managements December 31, 2005 assessment of the Allowance. However, assessing the adequacy of the Allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment. Managements judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events believed to be reasonable but which may or may not be valid. Thus, there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current Allowance or that future increases in the Allowance will not be required. No assurance can be given that managements ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio, in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances, will not require future additions to the Allowance, thus adversely impacting the results of operations of the Company. Deposits Retail deposit accounts have traditionally been the primary source of funds for the Company and also provide a customer base for the sale of additional financial products and services. The Company sets targets for growth in traditional deposit accounts annually in an effort to cross sell and increase the number of products per banking relationship. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company emphasized the growth of traditional deposit accounts through internal and external referral programs and targeted promotions. The Company offers a number of traditional deposit accounts including noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, savings, money market, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and certificate of deposit accounts. The Companys deposits are obtained primarily from residents within its market area. The Company experiences fluctuations in deposit flows because of the influence of general interest rates, market conditions, and competitive factors. The AssetLiability Committee meets weekly and makes changes relative to the mix, maturity, and pricing of assets and liabilities in order to minimize the impact on operations from such external conditions. Deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and generally low cost, as compared to other funding sources, and their ability to provide fee income through service charges and cross sales of other services. 41 Table of Contents The Company provides customers with access to their funds using the convenience of an ATM network which incorporates regional and national ATM networks. At December 31, 2005, the Bank had 32 ATM locations (including four at nonbanking offices) and five limited service banking offices located in various Upstate retirement centers. The Company also provides account access through its Internet and telephone banking products and attracts deposit customers by offering a variety of services and accounts, competitive interest rates, and conveniences such as extended banking office hours, both early and late, all-day deposit credit, and Saturday banking hours. In addition, the Company uses traditional marketing techniques, such as direct mailings and advertising, to attract new customers. Management believes the Company enjoys an excellent reputation for providing products and services that meet the needs of all of the Companys market segments. For example, Seniority Club members benefit from a number of advantageous programs. The following table summarizes the Companys deposit composition at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Total % of Total Total % of Total Transaction deposit accounts $ 351,629 38.9 % 309,561 37.4 Money market deposit accounts 111,380 12.4 95,608 11.6 Savings deposit accounts 45,360 5.0 44,972 5.4 Time deposit accounts 395,014 43.7 377,306 45.6 Total deposit accounts $ 903,383 100.0 % 827,447 100.0 Total traditional deposit accounts increased $75.9 million from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005, up from growth of $55.7 million from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. Core traditional deposit accounts, which include checking, money market, and savings accounts, grew by $58.2 million during fiscal year 2005, or 12.9%. Such accounts grew by $34.3 million, or 8.3%, during fiscal year 2004. The increase in core traditional deposit accounts during both of these periods was primarily a result of the Companys continued ability to attract deposits through pricing adjustments, expansion of its geographic market area, level of quality customer service, and through the Companys reputation in the communities served. Additionally, the growth in core traditional deposit accounts from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 was enhanced by targeted deposit promotions offered during the year. Such promotions may increase the Companys overall cost of funds, which may negatively impact the Companys future results of operations. In addition to the continuation of programs and promotions developed in years prior to 2005, such as enhancements made to the existing Seniority Club checking product and the Banks new customer referral program, several new programs and promotions were introduced during 2005 in an effort to grow lower-cost, core traditional deposit accounts. Such programs and promotions included the introduction of a health savings account product, a new business investment money market account, and free Charter checking products offered in conjunction with the opening of the Easley banking office and the Travelers Rest banking office new manager introduction. Time deposit accounts increased by $17.7 million, or 4.7% during fiscal year 2005 compared with growth of $21.4 million, or 6.0% during fiscal year 2004. In addition to the factors noted above, the growth in time deposit accounts was also impacted during 2005 by specifically targeted programs. Promotional 36 month certificate of deposit accounts offered during 2002 matured during 2005. The Bank offered rollover specials to these customers and was able to retain a large portion of these maturing funds. Additionally, during 2005 certificate of deposit promotions were offered in conjunction with the opening of the Easley banking office, the Travelers Rest banking office new manager introduction, and a certificate of deposit promotion available to all Bank customers offered in December 2005. Although deposit growth is a top priority of the Company, such growth is not dependent on targeted programs, and management does not believe the Company will lose deposits if it does not continue to offer targeted programs. 42 Table of Contents The Companys increase in core traditional deposit accounts results from its efforts to enhance the deposit mix by working to attract lower-cost deposit accounts. As noted above, core traditional deposit accounts grew by $58.2 million during fiscal year 2005 while higher-cost time deposit accounts increased by $17.7 million during the same period. The Companys average cost of core deposits for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 0.94% compared with 0.36% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Companys average cost of time deposits for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 2.99% compared with 2.56% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Companys average cost of total traditional deposit accounts increased from 1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 1.98% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Management does not believe that its dependence on traditional deposit account funding changed materially from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, traditional deposit accounts as a percentage of liabilities were 91.7% compared with 90.7% at December 31, 2004. Jumbo Certificates of Deposits. The Company does not rely significantly on large denomination certificate of deposit accounts. Such accounts totaled 12.5% and 13.1% of total liabilities at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The following table summarizes the Companys jumbo certificate of deposit accounts by time remaining until contractual maturity at December 31, 2005 (in thousands). Jumbo certificate of deposit accounts include those accounts with year-end balances totaling $100,000 or greater. Three months or less $ 27,729 Three months to six months 9,045 Six months to twelve months 28,381 Twelve months or less 65,155 Over twelve months 57,799 Total jumbo certificate of deposit accounts $ 122,954 Total jumbo certificate of deposit accounts totaled $119.8 million at December 31, 2004. As noted above, specifically targeted programs are often offered to stimulate deposit account growth. Such promotions were offered during the 36-month period ended December 31, 2005. During both fiscal years 2002 and 2003, 36-month Step Up Certificate of Deposit products were offered. Although all of the deposits generated by these promotions are not jumbo in size, the deposits that do fall into the jumbo category impact the maturities noted above. Certificate of deposit accounts generated through the 2002 promotion matured in 2005. As a result of the specially targeted deposit programs implemented to retain these funds, jumbo certificate of deposit accounts remained relatively unchanged from the levels at December 31, 2004. The certificate of deposit accounts obtained through the 2003 Step Up Certificate of Deposit promotion will mature in 2006 and are included within the applicable twelve months or less category. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys deposit accounts. Borrowings In addition to traditional deposit accounts, the Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowing to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to assist in meeting deposit withdrawal requirements, and to fund growth of interest-earning assets in excess of traditional deposit growth. Retail repurchase agreements, commercial paper, federal funds purchased, and FHLB borrowings serve as the Companys primary sources of such funds. 43 Table of Contents Borrowings decreased $3.9 million at the end of 2005 when compared with the end of 2004. Borrowings as a percentage of total liabilities were approximately 7.7% and 8.7% at the end of fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2004, respectively. The following table summarizes the Companys borrowings composition at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Total % of Total Total % of Total Retail repurchase agreements $ 16,728 22.1 % 16,397 20.6 Commercial paper 17,915 23.7 17,051 21.5 Federal funds purchased 1,000 1.3   FHLB borrowingsshort-term 16,900 22.4 16,000 20.1 FHLB borrowingslong-term 23,000 30.5 30,000 37.8 Total borrowings $ 75,543 100.0 % 79,448 100.0 Short-term and long-term borrowings are a source of funding that the Company utilizes depending on the current level of deposits, the desirability of raising deposits through market promotions, the Companys unused FHLB borrowing capacity, and the availability of collateral to secure FHLB borrowings. Long-term borrowings have maturities greater than one year when made. The Company offers commercial paper as an alternative investment tool for its commercial customers. Through a master note arrangement between the holding company and the Bank, Palmetto Master Notes are issued as an alternative investment for commercial sweep accounts. These master notes are unsecured but are backed by the full faith and credit of the holding company. The commercial paper is issued only in conjunction with the automated sweep account customer agreement on deposits at the Bank level. Federal funds purchased represent unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions. These borrowings are an important source of funding to the Company. Access to such short-term funding sources allows the Company to meet funding needs without relying on increasing deposits on a short-term basis. Interest rates on such borrowings vary from time to time in response to general economic conditions. FHLB borrowings are an alternative to other funding sources with similar maturities. The FHLB has established an overall credit limit for each member. This limit is designed to mitigate the FHLBs credit exposure to an individual member while encouraging members to diversify their funding sources. Generally, this credit limit is 40 percent of the members total assets. However, a members eligibility to borrow in excess of 30 percent of assets is subject to its meeting eligibility criteria. Under certain circumstances, a member approved for a 40 percent credit limit may request approval to exceed the credit limit. A member may exceed the 40 percent limit for a period not to exceed 12 months. This policy serves to define an upper limit for FHLB advances based on its current approved limit. Qualifying collateral to be pledged to secure advances from the FHLB may include qualifying securities, loans, deposits, and stock of the FHLB owned by the Company. The member has certain obligations to the FHLB for its pledged collateral. These obligations include periodic reporting on eligible, pledged collateral and adherence to the FHLBs collateral verification review procedures. At December 31, 2005, of its approximately $173 million available credit based on qualifying loans available to serve as collateral against borrowings from the FHLB, the Company employed $39.9 million in both short-term and long-term borrowings. 44 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Companys borrowings from the FHLB at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).

The FHLB publishes a schedule of such fees and charges on its website. In addition, the FHLB may assess fees to cover collateral verification reviews performed by, or on behalf of, the FHLB. The Company has not yet been charged any such fees and does not anticipate such fees, if assessed, will be significant. Any FHLB advance with a fixed interest rate is subject to a prepayment fee in the event of full or partial repayment prior to maturity or the expiration of any interim interest rate period. Management was not aware of any circumstances at December 31, 2005 that would require prepayment of any of the Companys FHLB advances. 45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes short-term borrowing information at and for the years indicated (dollars in thousands).

Rate presented represents the average rate for all tiers offered at year-end. Borrowing rates paid for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased from those paid for the year ended December 31, 2004. The primary reason for the changes in the yields paid on interest-bearing liabilities has been the action of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee. Since the second quarter of 2004, the federal funds rate has increased from 1.0% to 4.5% in a series of fourteen moves. The increases in the Companys borrowings costs from the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31, 2005 is attributed to these increasing rate trends. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys significant accounting policies with regard to FHLB borrowings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10 and Note 11 also contained herein for further discussion regarding the Companys borrowings. Capital Resources Average shareholders equity was $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, or 8.2% of average assets. Average shareholders equity was $76.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, or 8.2% of average assets. Total shareholders equity increased from $80.8 million at December 31, 2004 to $88.9 million at December 31, 2005. The Companys capital ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets was 8.3% at 46 Table of Contents December 31, 2005 compared with 8.1% at December 31, 2004. During 2005, shareholders equity was increased through the retention of earnings and stock option activity. These increases were offset by an increase in cash dividends and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income when comparing the year ended December 31, 2005 with the year ended December 31, 2004. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders Equity and Comprehensive Income contained herein for further discussion regarding the changes in stockholders equity during the years presented. During the third quarter of 2003, the Board of Directors approved the purchase of 100,000 shares of $5.00 par value common stock made available for purchase to the Company through an arms length transaction by a third party. The Company may make additional purchases of shares from time to time in the open market or in private transactions as such opportunities arise, however, no such purchases were transacted during 2005 or 2004. The Company and the Bank are required to meet regulatory capital requirements that currently include several measures of capital. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company and the Bank were each categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. See Item 1. BusinessSupervision and RegulationSupervision and Regulation of the Holding CompanyCapital Adequacy, Item 1. BusinessSupervision and RegulationSupervision and Regulation of the BankCapital Adequacy, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19 all contained herein for further discussion regarding the Banks and the Companys capital regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2005, there were no conditions or events of which management was aware that would materially change the Companys or the Banks status. During fiscal year 2005, the Companys cash dividend payout ratio was 30.27% compared with a payout ratio of 30.07% in 2004. Cash dividends per common share in 2005 totaled $0.66, an increase of 13.8% over dividends per common share in 2004 of $0.58. The amount of the dividends declared is dependent upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, capital position, and such other factors the Board deems relevant. South Carolina regulations restrict the amount of dividends that the Bank can pay to the holding company and may require prior approval before declaration and payment of any excess dividend.

In conjunction with the 2006 budgeting process, and in addition to approved capital expenditures relating to the Boiling Springs banking office and upgrades of existing banking offices described below, $1.6 million of capital expenditures were approved that management anticipates will be expended during 2006. Management does anticipate that requests will be made during 2006 that could not have been expected and, therefore, were not approved in the budgeting process. Funds to fulfill both budgeted and nonbudgeted commitments will come from operational cash flows of the Company. Management continually reviews opportunities for Upstate expansion that are believed to be in the best interest of the Company, its customers, and its shareholders. The Bank anticipates the opening of a new banking office in Boiling Springs, South Carolina during the fourth quarter of 2006. In conjunction with the 2006 budgeting process, $1.3 million of capital expenditures were approved relating to the opening of this banking office. Of this total budgeted amount, management anticipates spending approximately $900 thousand on construction, $400 thousand on furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and $15 thousand on software specific to this banking office. At December 31, 2005, the Bank had entered into an agreement with an independent contractor relative to the construction of this banking office for approximately the same amount budgeted in conjunction with the 2006 budgeting process. Management does anticipate that change orders will be entered into once 47 Table of Contents construction has commenced, however, it is not believed that such orders will result in construction costs materially higher than those budgeted. Additionally, an agreement has been entered into by the Company relative to vault, drive thru, security, and teller line equipment. Expense related to this agreement was budgeted within the furniture, fixtures, and equipment category discussed above. Expansion opportunities are currently being evaluated in the market areas in which the Company serves. Additionally, the Company has plans to upgrade facilities at existing locations. The Company has risk management policies and systems which attempt to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. Specifically, the Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its AssetLiability Committee and approved by its Board of Directors. The primary goal of the AssetLiability Committee is to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk through implementation of various strategies. While the AssetLiability Committee considers these strategies to ultimately position the Companys financial conditions in such a way to minimize fluctuations in income associated with interest rate risk, it also monitors the Companys capital positions to ensure that its strategies result in adequate positions of such other measures. The Banks total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio declined from 10.31% at December 31, 2004 to 10.18% at December 31, 2005 primarily due to the growth of 100% risk-weighed assets at a rate faster than that of risk-based capital. The Companys 2006 Profit Plan projected that total loans would grow by $55.9 million during 2005, however, total loans grew by $91.9 million during this period. Risk-based capital did not experience the same percentage of growth during the period thereby negatively impacting the total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio. The Company manages its financial condition in such a way to maximize earnings potential. As a component of its assetliability management, the Company continually explores options for adjustments to ensure such management does not prohibit the Bank from being in a well-capitalized position. Disclosures Regarding Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. The Companys market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure. The Company does not have any market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes. Interest rate sensitivity is managed by matching the repricing opportunities on interest-earning assets to those on interest-bearing liabilities. Management uses various assetliability strategies to manage the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within the Companys guidelines of acceptable levels of risk taking. Interest rate risk is addressed by the Companys AssetLiability Committee, which is comprised of certain members of senior management and a holding company board member. This committee monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact on net interest income from potential changes in interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure. The committee also manages the Companys balance sheet, in part, to maintain the potential impact on net interest income within acceptable ranges despite changes in interest rate. The Companys exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the Companys AssetLiability Committee and Board of Directors. Interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates. If potential changes to net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the Companys guidelines, the Board may direct management to adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within such guidelines. Current guidelines of the Companys AssetLiability Committee include maintaining the projected negative impact on the Companys net interest income for the coming twelve month period at an amount not to exceed 20%. Management adjusts the Companys interest rate risk exposure position primarily through decisions on the pricing, maturity, and marketing of particular deposit and loan products and through decisions regarding the structure and maturities of FHLB advances and other borrowings. 48 Table of Contents Market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as derivatives and other financial instruments. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company had not used any derivatives to alter its interest rate risk profile. The Companys financial instruments include loans, federal funds sold, FHLB stock, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings. At December 31, 2005, the Companys interest-sensitive assets totaled approximately $977.7 million while interest-sensitive liabilities totaled approximately $822.5 million. At December 31, 2004, the Companys interest-sensitive assets totaled approximately $872.3 million while interest-sensitive liabilities totaled approximately $730.4 million. The yield on interest-sensitive assets and the cost of interest-sensitive liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 6.42% and 2.10%, respectively, compared to 5.85% and 1.53%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in the yield on interest-sensitive assets and the cost of interest-sensitive liabilities resulted from the rising interest rate environment. The Companys interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities estimated $998 million and $849 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. The Company evaluated the results of its net interest income simulation prepared as of December 31, 2005 for interest rate risk management purposes. Overall, the model results indicate that the Companys interest rate risk sensitivity is within limits set by the Companys guidelines and the Companys balance sheet is liability sensitive. A liability sensitive balance sheet suggests that in falling interest rate environment, net interest margin would increase and during an increasing interest rate environment, net interest margin would decrease. Net Interest Income Simulation In order to measure interest rate risk, the Company uses a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecasted changes in interest rates. This analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario and a net interest income forecast using a base market interest rate derived from the current treasury yield curve. The income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the repricing relationships for each of the Companys products. Many of the Companys assets are floating rate loans, which are assumed to reprice immediately, and to the same extent as the change in market rates according to contracted indexes. Some loans and investment securities include the opportunity of prepayment, and, accordingly, the simulation model uses national indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields. The Companys nonterm deposit products reprice more slowly, usually changing less than the change in market rates and at the Companys discretion. This analysis summarizes the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions. It assumes growth in the balance sheet. It does not account for all factors that impact this analysis, including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to the Companys credit risk profile as interest rates change. Furthermore, loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly. Interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis. Changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on net interest income. As of December 31, 2005, the following table summarizes forecasted net interest income and net interest margin using a base market rate and the estimated change to the base scenario given upward and downward movement in interest rates of 100 basis points and 200 basis points (dollars in thousands). Interest rate scenario Adjusted netinterestincome Percentagechangefrom base Net interestmargin Net interestmarginchange (inbasis points) Up 200 basis points $ 47,122 (6.57 )% 4.51 % (0.32 ) Up 100 basis points 48,841 (3.16 ) 4.68 (0.15 ) BASE CASE 50,434  4.83  Down 100 basis points 51,680 2.47 4.95 0.12 Down 200 basis points 51,257 1.63 4.91 0.08 49 Table of Contents The simulation results as of December 31, 2005 indicate the Companys interest rate risk position was liability sensitive as the simulated impact of an downward movement in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in a 2.47% increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12 month period while an upward movement in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in a 3.16% decrease in net interest income over the next 12 months. The simulation results indicate that a 100 basis point downward shift in interest rates would result in a 12 basis point increase in net interest margin, assuming all other variables remained unchanged. Conversely, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would cause a 15 basis point decrease in net interest margin. The projected negative impact on the Companys net interest income for the twelve month period does not exceed the 20% threshold prescribed by the AssetLiability Committees policy. Liquidity General The term liquidity refers to the ability of the Company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its operating needs. Management determines the desired level of liquidity for the Company in conjunction with the Companys Asset-Liability Committee. The level of liquidity is based on managements strategy for the Company, commitments to make loans, and the Committees assessment of the Companys ability to generate funds. Proper liquidity management is crucial to ensure that the Company is able to take advantage of new business opportunities and meet the demands of its customers. In this process, the Company focuses on assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet the Companys needs. The Companys liquidity is impacted by its ability to attract and retain deposit accounts, activity within and sales from its investment securities and loan portfolios, alternative sources of funds, and current earnings. Competition for deposits is intense in the markets served by the Company. However, the Company has been able to attract deposits through pricing adjustments, expansion of its geographic market area, level of quality customer service, and through the Companys reputation in the communities served. The Companys deposit base is diversified with no one deposit or type of customer accounting for a significant portion of the portfolio. As such, the Company does not expect that withdrawals will fluctuate significantly from historical levels in the near term. The loan portfolio of the Company is a source of liquidity through maturities and repayments by borrowers. Loan demand has been constant, and loan originations can be controlled through pricing decisions. The investment securities portfolio is also an avenue for liquidity through scheduled maturities, sales of investment securities, and prepayment of principal on mortgage-backed securities. Approximately 83% of the investment securities portfolio was pledged to secure public deposits as of December 31, 2005 as compared with 65% at December 31, 2004. Each of the Companys sources of liquidity is subject to various uncertainties beyond the control of the Company. As a measure of protection, additional funding sources have been arranged through federal funds lines at correspondent banks and through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. At December 31, 2005, the Company had additional funding sources totaling of $39 million that were accessible at the Companys option. FHLB borrowings are an alternative to other funding sources with similar maturities. At December 31, 2005, of its approximately $173 million available credit based on qualifying loans available to serve as collateral against borrowings from the FHLB, the Company employed $39.9 million in both short-term and long-term borrowings.

Retail repurchase agreements, commercial paper, federal funds purchased, and FHLB borrowings serve as the Companys primary sources of such funds.

Lease Agreements Obligations under noncancelable real property operating lease agreements are payable over several years with the longest obligation expiring in 2029. Management does not feel that any existing noncancelable operating lease agreements are likely to materially impact the Companys financial condition or results of operations in an adverse way. Contractual obligations relative to these agreements are noted in the table above. Option periods that the Company has not yet exercised are not included in this analysis as they do not represent contractual obligations of the Company until exercised. See
