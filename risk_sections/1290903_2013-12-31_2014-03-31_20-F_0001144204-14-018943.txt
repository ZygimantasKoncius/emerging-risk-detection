Board Practices Between January 1, 2013 and February 28, 2014, we have not entered into any service contracts or other arrangements providing for benefits upon termination with our directors, provided, however, that any non-vested performance units granted to our independent directors shall vest in full in the event that Expedia effects a going private transaction of us and, provided further, that if, during the one-year period following a change in control, an independent director incurs a termination other than by reason of death, disability or cause, the independent director is entitled to an additional 12 months of vesting of their unvested options or performance units. In addition, in 2013, we entered into performance unit agreements with our CEO and Director, Guangfu Cui, which are discussed below. - 54 - A company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by a single entity is considered a “controlled company” under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and is not required to comply with Nasdaq corporate governance rules requiring its board of directors to have a majority of independent directors and independent compensation and corporate governance and nominating committees. Because more than 50% of our voting power is held by Expedia through its indirect subsidiary, Expedia Asia Pacific, we qualify as a “controlled company” under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and we avail ourselves of the controlled company exception provided under those rules. If in the future we were no longer a controlled company or able to use the home-country exemption from certain Nasdaq corporate governance rules, then a majority of our board of directors would need to be independent directors, and it would be necessary for us to have compensation and corporate governance and nominating committees that were composed entirely of independent directors, subject to a phase-in period. See also “Item 16G: Corporate Governance.” Committees of the Board of Directors Audit Committee Thomas Gurnee (who serves as chairman), Fernando Gil de Bernabé and Michael Scown are currently the members of our audit committee. We have adopted a written audit committee charter pursuant to which the audit committee is responsible for the appointment of our independent public accountants and reports to our board of directors regarding the scope and results of our annual audits, compliance with our accounting and financial policies and internal accounting controls. Audit committee pre-approval is required for all non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditors. For additional information on our Audit Committee, see “Item 16A: Audit Committee Financial Expert,” and “Item 16C: Principal Accountant Fees and Services.” Compensation Committee Henrik Kjellberg (who serves as chairman), Thomas Gurnee and Johan Svanstrom are currently the members of our compensation committee. The compensation committee determines compensation to be provided to our executive officers and directors. In addition, the compensation committee approves bonus and stock compensation arrangements for all of our employees. Under an Investors Agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific and certain other shareholders dated July 23, 2004, Expedia has the right to appoint two directors to the compensation committee, and the compensation committee does not have the authority to approve the issuance of equity compensation unless two directors nominated by Expedia are on the compensation committee. Executive Committee In August 2011, our board of directors established an Executive Committee which is currently comprised of Guangfu Cui, Thomas Gurnee and Henrik Kjellberg. Acting on behalf of our board of directors, the Executive Committee has all power and authority of the board of directors, except for (i) powers reserved for the Audit Committee or the Compensation Committee under applicable law or contract or (ii) matters requiring consent of TCH Sapphire under the Investor Rights Agreement entered into among TCH Sapphire, Expedia Asia Pacific and eLong in May 2011. Actions of the Executive Committee require unanimous approval by its members. Duties of Directors Under Cayman Islands law, each of our directors has a duty of loyalty to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to the best interests of our company and for a proper purpose. Our directors also have a duty to exercise the skills that they actually possess and such care and diligence that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. Our directors must ensure compliance with our company’s memorandum of association and articles of association. A shareholder may have the right to seek damages on behalf of our company if a duty owed by our directors to our company is breached. - 55 - Limitation on Liability and Other Indemnification Matters Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our articles of association provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such, but the indemnity does not extend to any matter in respect of any willful neglect or intentional malfeasance which may be attached to such person. Compensation of Senior Management and Directors We paid aggregate cash compensation of US$0.3 million to our independent directors in 2013. Pursuant to our independent director compensation policy, an annual grant of performance units is made to each of our independent directors. Grants made prior to 2013 are settled in cash. On June 1, 2013, we granted each of our independent directors 10,668 performance units which will vest over a three-year period at one-third each year on the anniversary of the grant date, and which may be settled in either cash or ordinary shares at the discretion of each independent director. Our independent directors also receive an annual retainer and meeting fees as well as reimbursement of travel expenses incurred in connection with board and board committee service. We do not compensate our directors currently employed by us, Expedia, Tencent or affiliates of Expedia or Tencent for service on our board of directors or board committees. Our CEO, Mr. Guangfu Cui, became a member of our board of directors in February 2011, and his compensation is discussed below. Compensation arrangements with our senior executive officers consist of (i) cash compensation, which includes an annual salary and the opportunity to earn an annual bonus based on the performance of the company or department, (ii) equity compensation in the form of stock options and/or performance units, and (iii) other benefits in the form of vacation days and health insurance. We paid aggregate cash compensation of RMB11.2 million (US$1.9 million) to our current senior executive officers in 2013. Between January 1, 2013 and February 28, 2014, we also granted equity compensation in the form of stock options and/or performance units to our current senior executive officers, as described below. Our senior executive officers and directors are not eligible to participate in the Company’s interest-free loan program. Employment Agreements with Executive Officers Employment agreement with Guangfu Cui. We entered into an employment agreement with Guangfu Cui, our Chief Executive Officer and Director, effective October 8, 2007. The employment agreement, as amended, provides an annual base salary of RMB2.3 million (US$0.4 million), and an annual bonus of up to RMB2.5 million (US$0.4 million). Pursuant to the employment agreement, in October 2007 Mr. Cui was granted 111,112 performance units and an option to purchase 111,112 of our ordinary shares, with an exercise price of US$4.50 per share; both the option and performance units are now fully-vested. For information on subsequent equity grants made to Mr. Cui, see “Equity Compensation Plan and Grants” below. We have entered into standard form employment agreements and non-competition and confidentiality agreements with our other senior executive officers. Share Ownership For information on our major shareholders, please see “Item 7: Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions.” Equity Compensation Plans and Grants We have adopted three equity compensation plans: the eLong, Inc. Stock Option Plan, adopted in April 2001 (the “2001 Plan”), the eLong, Inc. Stock and Annual Incentive Plan, adopted in July 2004 (the “2004 Plan”), and the eLong, Inc. 2009 Share and Annual Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”). There are no options or performance units outstanding, and we do not intend to issue any new equity grants, under the 2001 Plan. The 2004 and 2009 Plans are discussed in more detail below. - 56 - Under the 2004 Plan, we have granted performance units and options to purchase our ordinary shares, of which 251,112 options and 9,956 performance units granted to our employees or directors were outstanding as of February 28, 2014. Stock options granted under the 2004 Plan generally expire ten years after the grant date. We currently do not intend to issue any additional equity grants under the 2004 Plan. Under the 2009 Plan, as amended, we have authorized a total of 17,000,000 of our ordinary shares for issuance. As of February 28, 2014, 1,732,356 stock options and 7,412,530 performance units issued to our employees and directors were outstanding and had not been exercised under the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan was adopted by our board of directors on May 13, 2009, was amended to allow grants to our Directors and approved by our shareholders on December 30, 2009, was amended by our board of directors on March 17, 2011 to increase the total number of authorized shares from 3,000,000 to 6,000,000, was amended by our board of directors on April 24, 2012 to increase the total number of authorized shares to 12,000,000, and was amended by our board of directors on September 18, 2013 to increase the total number of authorized shares to 17,000,000 and to allow subsequent amendments to be made by either our board of directors or the Executive Committee of our board of directors. Under the 2009 Plan, the Compensation Committee or the board of directors may grant stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares or performance units to our employees, directors, officers or consultants. The terms of the 2009 Plan differ from those of the 2004 Plan in some respects, including but not limited to, the following: •Upon the occurrence of a “change in control,” the 2009 Plan provides for immediate vesting of the then outstanding options or other equity grants under the 2009 Plan to employees with the rank of Vice President or above; and •Within two years following the date of a change of control, if the employment of a recipient of an award under the 2009 Plan is terminated or resigns for “good reason” (as defined under the 2009 Plan), such employee’s options and other equity grants would vest. Change of control is defined in the 2009 Plan to include (i) the acquisition or control of the majority of our voting power by a person or group other than Barry Diller, Liberty Media, Expedia and their respective affiliates; (ii) announcement by a person of a going private transaction or other transaction which will result in our ordinary shares or ADSs no longer being publicly listed; and (iii) certain other types of business combinations or sales or dispositions of the majority of our assets. Under the terms of the relevant stock option or performance unit agreements, the grants we made to our employees on March 9, 2010, March 7, 2011, February 27, 2012 and September 18, 2013 do not immediately vest upon the announcement by a person of a going private transaction or other transaction which will result in our ordinary shares or ADSs no longer being publicly listed. The following table summarizes, as of February 28, 2014, the unvested and outstanding stock options granted under our equity compensation plans. Unless otherwise noted below, the stock options are fully vested and exercisable.

(2)Vests over a three-year period with one-third vesting on each of the second, third and fourth anniversary of the grant date. (3)Vests over a four-year period with one-half vesting on each of the third and fourth anniversary of the grant date. (4)Vests over a two-year period with one-half vesting on each of the first and second anniversary of June 8, 2013. Performance units are awards in the form of units that are denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of our ordinary shares, which number of units are determined based on the fair market value of our ordinary shares. At the time of grant, our board of directors or the compensation committee determines if we will settle the performance units in cash, stock or both. Performance units granted to our employees are settled in ordinary shares; certain performance units granted to our independent directors are settled upon vesting in cash in an amount equal to the number of the vested performance units multiplied by the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the applicable vesting date. The fair market value of the performance units is determined based upon the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the trading date immediately preceding the grant date for awards made under the 2004 Plan, and the grant date (or if the grant date is not a trading day then the immediately preceding trading date) for awards made under the 2009 Plan. Our performance units are subject to service-based vesting where a specific period of continued employment must pass before the performance units are vested. On December 3, 2012, we enacted a voluntary program which allowed certain employees to exchange certain stock options which were previously vested or expected to vest in 2012, 2013 or 2014, for new performance units at a ratio of 1 option to 0.8 performance units. The new performance units were granted under the 2009 Plan, and vest semi-annually over 2 years from the grant date (25% every six-months). Under this program employees cancelled 1,461,746 ordinary share options (including 302,762 stock options granted under the 2004 Plan and 1,158,984 options granted under the 2009 Plan) in exchange for 1,169,406 performance units. On September 18, 2013, we granted 6,341,346 performance units to our chief executive officer and other members of senior management.
