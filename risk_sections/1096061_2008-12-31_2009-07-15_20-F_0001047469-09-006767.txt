D. Risk Factors If you are considering purchasing our ordinary shares, preference shares or American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), you should carefully read and think about all the information contained in this document, including the risk factors set out below, prior to making any investment decision. Risks Relating to the Current Financial Crisis We are vulnerable to the current disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets. Since September 2007, the global financial system has experienced difficult credit and liquidity conditions and disruptions resulting in reduced liquidity and greater volatility and widening of credit spreads, both generally and with respect to Greek issuers in particular. In September 2008, global financial markets deteriorated sharply following the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc. ("Lehman Brothers"). In the days that followed, it became apparent that a number of other major financial institutions, including some of the largest global commercial banks, investment banks, mortgage lenders, mortgage guarantors and insurance companies, were experiencing significant funding and capitalization difficulties. The resulting lack of credit, lack of confidence in the financial sector, increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity have adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, continued or worsening disruption and lack of liquidity in the global financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access capital and liquidity on financial terms acceptable to us, or at all. 11 The financial problems faced by our customers generally could adversely affect us. Market turmoil and deteriorating macro-economic conditions, especially in Greece, Turkey and SEE, could materially adversely affect the liquidity, businesses and/or financial conditions of our borrowers, which could in turn further increase our non-performing loan ratios, impair our loan and other financial assets and result in decreased demand for borrowings in general. In the context of continued market turmoil, worsening macro-economic conditions, declining consumer spending and increasing unemployment, the value of assets collateralizing our secured loans, including homes and other real estate, could decline significantly, which could result in impairment of the value of our loan assets and as well as be accompanied by an increase in our non-performing loan ratios. In addition, our customers may further significantly decrease their risk tolerance to non-deposit investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds, which would adversely affect our fee and commission income. Any of the conditions described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, many nations' economies, both advanced and less developed, are widely considered to be in the midst of, or about to enter, economic recession. Further economic deterioration, especially in Greece, Turkey and SEE or their significant trading partners would adversely affect our income, results of operations, business and prospects. Government interventions aimed at alleviating the financial crisis are subject to uncertainty and carry additional risks. In an attempt to restore stability in the financial system, the United States, European and other governments have intervened on an unprecedented scale by making funds available and taking other measures designed to facilitate access to capital and support financial institutions and other industries that have been affected by the market turmoil. In November 2008, the Greek Parliament approved the Hellenic Republic bank support plan, with the objective, among others, of strengthening Greek banks' capital and liquidity positions. See Item 4.B, "Business OverviewRegulation and Supervision of Banks in GreecePlan for the Support of the Liquidity of the Greek Economy" for a detailed description of the current plan. There is no assurance that these measures will improve liquidity conditions or otherwise achieve their intended effects, and a failure of these measures could prolong or exacerbate global and local adverse market conditions and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of these measures could lead to increased ownership and control by the Hellenic Republic over financial institutions and further consolidation in the financial industry. With respect to the Hellenic Republic bank support plan, our participation has resulted in the Hellenic Republic's direct representation on the board of directors of the Bank ("Board of Directors" or "Board") and its possession of certain veto rights over shareholders' resolutions. See also Item 4.B, "Business OverviewRegulation and Supervision of Banks in GreecePlan for the Support of the Liquidity of the Greek Economy". Furthermore, our preference shares issued to the Hellenic Republic under this plan may become convertible into ordinary shares in certain circumstances, and could therefore have a significant dilutive effect on the value of our ordinary shares, as well as result in direct government voting representation at our annual and extraordinary shareholder meetings. We are exposed to risks potentially faced by other financial institutions. We routinely transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Defaults by, and even rumors or questions about the solvency of, certain financial institutions and counterparties generally have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults 12 by other institutions. These liquidity concerns have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, inter-institutional financial transactions in general. Many of the routine transactions we enter into expose us to significant credit risk in the event of default by one of our significant counterparties. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient for us to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. Despite the risk control measures we have in place, recent events, including the collapse of Lehman Brothers, illustrate the difficulties in predicting counterparty risk. A default by a significant financial counterparty, or liquidity problems in the financial services industry in general, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our wholesale borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings. On December 11, 2008 Moody's Investors Services Limited ("Moody's") confirmed the Bank's "negative outlook" status, while its long-term credit rating remains Aa3. Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies ("Standard & Poor's"), confirmed the Bank's "negative outlook" status on May 4, 2009 although it confirmed BBB+ for the Bank's long-term credit rating. Fitch Ratings Ltd. ("Fitch") confirmed the Bank's "negative outlook" status on March 13, 2009 although it confirmed the Bank's A- long-term credit rating. Any reduction in the long-term credit ratings of the Bank, could increase our wholesale borrowing costs. Any reductions may also limit our access to the debt capital markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivative contracts and other secured-funding arrangements. As a result, any reduction in the Bank's credit ratings could adversely affect our access to liquidity and competitive position or have a negative impact on our earnings and financial condition. Through its holding of preference shares in the Bank, the Hellenic Republic is in a position to exert influence over the Group. The Hellenic Republic directly owns all 70 million non-transferable redeemable preference shares issued under the capital facility of the Hellenic Republic bank support plan. This direct stake in the Bank endows the Hellenic Republic with voting rights at the general meeting of preferred shareholders and requires the inclusion of a government-appointed representative, on our Board, who attends the general meeting of ordinary shareholders of the Bank (the "General Meeting"). This representative has the ability to veto actions relating to the distribution of dividends and the remuneration of certain of the Bank's directors and senior management as well as influence the strategic decisions of the Group. See also Item 4.B, "Business OverviewRegulation and Supervision of Banks in GreecePlan for the Support of the Liquidity of the Greek Economy". In addition, the Hellenic Republic will have a preemptive right to subscribe for new ordinary shares that are not subscribed for by holders of rights pursuant to the rights issue currently undertaken by the Bank, which may result in an increase in the Hellenic Republic's shareholding. There is a risk that the Hellenic Republic might seek to exert influence over the Group and may disagree with certain decisions of the Bank and the Group relating to dividend distributions, benefits policies and other commercial decisions which may ultimately limit the operational flexibility of the Group. Furthermore, the Hellenic Republic also has interests in other Greek financial institutions and an interest in the health of the Greek banking industry and other industries generally, and those interests may not always be aligned with the commercial interests of the Group or its shareholders. Shareholders may disagree as to whether an action opposed or supported by the Hellenic Republic is in the best interests of the Group generally. 13 There can be no assurance that, if economic conditions do not improve or continue to deteriorate and/or if the financial position of the Group deteriorates, further government intervention will not take place. The Bank may not pay dividends to its ordinary shareholders. As a result of our participation in the Hellenic Republic bank support plan, our dividends are subject to a maximum of 35% of the Bank's distributable profits (on an unconsolidated basis) for as long as the Bank participates in the Hellenic Republic bank support plan, and any decisions regarding distribution of dividends can be vetoed by the Hellenic Republic representative who sits on our Board and attends the General Meeting. Our participation has also resulted in the issuance of fixed return preference shares to the Hellenic Republic. In addition, in June 2008, we issued 25 million non-cumulative, non-voting redeemable preference shares. Payments of dividend on these existing preference shares and payments of the fixed return for the preference shares issued pursuant to the Hellenic Republic bank support plan take preference over distributable profits otherwise available to our ordinary shareholders. Pursuant to Greek Law 3756/2009, we did not pay any cash dividends to our ordinary shareholders in 2009 in respect of the 2008 financial year. There can be no assurance that subsequent legislation will not prohibit us from paying cash dividends in subsequent years. Furthermore, as a result of the global financial crisis and deteriorating macro-economic conditions, our net profits may decline. Consequently, we may not be able to pay dividends to our ordinary shareholders in 2010, and if current market conditions persist or if we continue to participate in the Hellenic Republic bank support plan, in the near-to medium-term. See also Item 8.A, "Consolidated Statements and Other Financial InformationPolicy on Dividend Distributions". Risks Relating to Our Business The state of the economic and political environments in Greece, Turkey and SEE significantly affect our performance. For the financial year ended December 31, 2008, 55.1% of our total income, and as of December 31, 2008, 70.2% of our gross loans were derived from our operations in Greece. As a result, the state of the Greek economy significantly affects our financial performance as well as the market price and liquidity of the Bank's shares. To an increasing extent, our performance is affected by the economic conditions and levels of economic activity in other countries in which we operate, especially Turkey (see this Item 3.D, "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessOperating in Turkey carries specific macroeconomic and political risks"), from which 14.5% of our gross loan portfolio and 30.4% of our total income were derived in 2008, and SEE countries (see this Item 3.D, "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessWe conduct significant international activities and are expanding in emerging markets"), from which 12.8% of our gross loan portfolio and 12.0% of our total income were derived in 2008. Consequently, an economic slowdown, a deterioration of economic or political conditions in Greece, or other adverse changes affecting the Greek economy or the economies of other countries in which we operate, could result in, among other things, higher rates of credit defaults on loans or declines in new borrowing, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Moreover, the economic and political environment both in Greece and in other countries in which we operate may be adversely affected by events outside our control, such as changes in government policies, EU directives in the banking sector and other areas, political instability or military action affecting Europe and/or other areas abroad and taxation and other political, economic or social developments in or affecting Greece and the countries in which we operate or may plan to expand. Finally, further changes in macro-economic conditions such as the level and liquidity of the global financial and other asset markets, investor sentiment and the availability and cost of credit may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 14 Operating in Turkey carries specific macroeconomic and political risks. As a result of the Group's acquisition of Finansbank A.S. ("Finansbank") in August 2006, the Group is subject to operating risks in Turkey, including the following: Turkey is a parliamentary democracy and, although stable, is not free from political uncertainty. Turkey has many characteristics of a developing economy. Over the past two decades, the Turkish economy has undergone a transformation from a highly protected and regulated system to a free market economy. The Turkish economy has, in general, responded well to this transformation, showing an overall pattern of growth from 1992 to 2008. However, the Turkish economy experienced a succession of financial crises in 2000 and 2001 as well as macroeconomic imbalances, including substantial budget deficits, significant balance of payments deficits, high inflation rates and high real interest rates. Furthermore, Turkey remains dependent on external financing, and its economy is exposed to the effects of the global credit crisis. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Turkey's economic growth was negative for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2001, bringing full-year 2008 growth to 1.1%. In December 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that Turkey may require assistance from the IMF in order to meet its financial requirements for 2009. If Turkey's economy contracts this year, such a contraction would have a negative impact on Finansbank's operations in Turkey. Military operations in the Middle East and political instability in Iraq have increased the political and economic risks in the region. The current situation in the area may contribute to further tension and may result in terrorist activities in Turkey. These risks may have an impact on the Turkish economy and the Bank's operations there. Historically, the Turkish currency has been subject to significant volatility against the euro and other currencies. For example, the Turkish lira depreciated by 20.3% against the euro and by 24.3% against the US dollar between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008. From the Group's acquisition of Finansbank on August 18, 2006 to December 31, 2008, the Turkish lira has depreciated by 13% against the euro and by 5.7% against the US dollar. These fluctuations could have an impact on the value of the Bank's investment in Finansbank and on the Group's overall profitability. The Group has taken steps in the past to reduce its exposure to Turkish lira exchange rate fluctuations, and intends to continue to implement such programs; however, such protection may not be available on as favorable terms as have been available in the past or at all. The Group believes the general level of macroeconomic and political risk to be higher in Turkey than in other countries whose economies and banking markets are more developed and that are already members of the EU. While the Group believes there is potential for substantial growth in the Turkish banking market, there is no guarantee that such growth will occur or that Finansbank will be able to benefit from that growth. Adverse macroeconomic and political events, which limit economic growth in Turkey or restrict the growth of the banking market, may adversely affect Finansbank's business and could adversely affect the Bank's business, results of operations or financial condition. Relations between Greece and Turkey have gone through periods of tension. If, as a result of these tensions, certain customers of Finansbank hold a negative perception of Greece, Finansbank may be adversely affected. A significant loss of customers could have a material adverse effect on the development of the Group's business in Turkey and on the Group's overall profitability. 15 Changes in the competitive environment in Turkey may adversely affect Finansbank's business. Increased competition from existing competitors or from new entrants to the Turkish market could limit Finansbank's ability to grow or to maintain its market share and could cause downward pressure on margins, which could adversely affect the Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives in Turkey. We conduct significant international activities and are expanding in emerging markets. Apart from our operations in Greece and Turkey, we have built up substantial operations in Bulgaria, Romania, FYROM, Serbia and other developing economies. Our international operations are exposed to the risk of adverse political, governmental or economic developments in the countries in which we operate. In addition, most of the countries outside Greece in which we operate are emerging markets where we face particular operating risks. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our international operations also expose us to foreign currency risk. A decline in the value of the currencies in which our international subsidiaries receive their income or hold their assets relative to the value of the euro may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we pursue expansion of our international market position through acquisitions and organic growth in SEE, and the Southeastern Mediterranean region. Volatility in interest rates may negatively affect our net interest income before provisions for loan losses and have other adverse consequences. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. The period since September 2007 has been a period of volatile interbank lending rates. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, central banks have sharply decreased interest rates. There can be no guarantee that further events will not alter the interest rate environment again. As with any bank, changes in market interest rates affect the interest rates we charge on our interest-earning assets differently than the interest rates we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. This difference could reduce our net interest income before provisions for loan losses and net interest margins. Since the majority of our loan portfolio effectively reprices in five years or less, rising interest rates may also result in an increase in our allowance for loan losses if customers cannot refinance in a higher interest rate environment. Further, an increase in interest rates may reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect us through, among other things, lower net interest margins, increased pre-payments on our loan and mortgage portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Non-performing loans have had a negative impact on our operations and may continue to do so. Non-performing loans represented approximately 2.8% of our total customer loans portfolio as at December 31, 2008. Since then, this percentage has increased. See Item 4.E, "Selected Statistical DataCredit Quality and Risk ManagementNon-Performing Loans, Allowance for Loan Losses, and Loan Loss Experience" and Item 5.A, "Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsKey Factors Affecting our Results of OperationsNon-Performing Loans". The effect of the continuing deterioration of global macroeconomic conditions on the regions in which we operate will lead to additional non-performing loan generation during the second quarter and for the remainder of 2009. Our current credit approval and monitoring procedures focus on the borrower's cash flow and ability to repay in an effort to improve the quality of our loan assets and mitigate future allowances for loan losses. However, we cannot assure you that these credit approval and monitoring procedures will reduce the amount of provisions for loans that become non-performing in the future. In addition, the outlook for the global economy in 2009 and 2010 remains unstable for the economies of Greece, Turkey and SEE. This may 16 result in adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers, with increasing delinquencies and defaults. Future provisions for non-performing loans could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. We face significant competition from Greek and foreign banks. The general scarcity of wholesale funding has led to a significant increase in competition for retail deposits. We also face competition from foreign banks, some of which may have resources greater than our own. We may not be able to continue to compete successfully with domestic and international banks in the future. Our ability to reduce staff in Greece is limited. Part of our strategy is to increase profitability by making our operations more efficient. Our ability to realize one component of this, reducing staff, is limited by Greek labor laws, our collective agreement, current employment regulation and our desire to maintain good relations with our employees. As a result, we will continue to depend on voluntary redundancies and attrition to achieve staff reductions. We will continue to assess whether we will be able to reduce our staff. However, we may not always be successful in achieving such reductions. The loss of senior management may adversely affect our ability to implement our strategy. Our current senior management team includes a number of executives that we believe contribute significant experience and expertise to our management in the banking sectors in which we operate. The continued success of our business and our ability to execute our business strategy will depend, in large part, on the efforts of our senior management. For instance, a change of government in Greece could lead to the departure of certain senior managers. If a substantial portion of our senior management leaves us, our business may be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to recruit or retain experienced and/or qualified personnel. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified and experienced banking and management personnel. Competition in the Greek and other SEE banking industries for personnel with relevant expertise is intense, due to the relatively limited availability of qualified individuals. To recruit qualified and experienced employees and to minimize the possibility of their departure, we provide compensation packages consistent with evolving standards in the relevant labor markets. However, inability to recruit and retain qualified and experienced personnel in Greece, Turkey and SEE, or manage our current personnel successfully, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. We could be exposed to significant future pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities. In common with other large companies in Greece that are, or were, in the public sector, the employees of the Bank and certain of our subsidiaries participate in employee-managed pension schemes. The Bank and certain of our subsidiaries make significant contributions to these schemes. In addition, the Bank and several of our subsidiaries offer other post-retirement benefit plans, including medical benefit plans. Our consolidated net liability under these plans as at December 31, 2008 was €414.1 million, determined by reference to a number of critical assumptions that are subject to potential variation. Such variation may cause us to incur significantly increased liability in respect of these obligations. For more information on our current obligations under pension plans and the assumptions by reference to which they are determined, please refer to Note 38 to the U.S. GAAP financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, included in this Annual Report. 17 Following legislation passed in April 2008, the Bank's main pension plan and the main pension branch of Ethniki Hellenic General Insurance S.A.'s ("EH") post-retirement and health plan, both of which are defined-contribution plans, have been incorporated into the main pension branch of the state-sponsored social security fund ("IKAETAM") as of August 1, 2008. Pursuant to this legislation, the Bank will contribute into IKAETAM €25.5 million per year for 15 years starting from December 2009. In addition, in 2005 and 2006, the Hellenic Republic passed legislation permitting bank employee auxiliary pension schemes to merge with the new Insurance Fund of Bank Employees ("ETAT"). The relevant legislation provides that, in connection with the merger of auxiliary schemes with ETAT, the relevant employer shall make a payment to ETAT solely in an amount to be determined by an independent financial report commissioned by the Ministry of Finance pursuant to this legislation. Subsequently, in April 2006 the Bank applied under Greek Law 3371/2005, as amended, to merge its Auxiliary Pension Fund into ETAT. It is possible that we may have a future requirement to make a significant cash payment to ETAT in connection with the merger of the Bank's employee pension schemes with ETAT. The foregoing developments, as well as future interpretations of existing laws and any future legislation regarding pensions and pension liabilities or other post-retirement benefit obligations, may increase the liability of the Bank or its subsidiaries with respect to pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions to cover actuarial or operating deficits of those plans. The Greek banking sector is subject to strikes. Most of the Bank's employees belong to a union and the Greek banking industry has been subject to strikes over the issues of pensions and wages. Bank employees throughout Greece went on strike for twelve days in 2008 and two days in 2009 (up to June 30, 2009), largely to further their demands for wage increases and in opposition to pension reforms proposed by the Hellenic Republic in March 2008. Prolonged labor unrest could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's operations in Greece. We are exposed to credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and insurance risk. As a result of our activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks. Among the most significant of these risks are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and insurance risk. Failure to control these risks could result in material adverse effects on our financial performance and reputation. Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss relating to the failure of a borrower to honor its contractual obligations. Credit risk arises in lending activities and also in various other activities where we are exposed to the risk of counterparty default, such as our trading, capital markets and settlement activities. Counterparty default can be caused by a number of reasons, which we may not be able to accurately assess at the time it undertakes the relevant activity. Credit risk has increased in the period since September 2007. Furthermore, the database that monitors defaulting customers across the banking system in Greece, commonly known as "Teiresias", does not monitor aggregate amounts of non-defaulted loans outstanding to a debtor. The Credit Bureau services of Teiresias are expanding and a database for non-defaulted loans is being set up but is still incomplete. Consequently, the Bank is subject to the risk that its customers may have borrowed unsustainably large amounts from other banks and cannot confirm if and when the database will be completed. Market Risk. Market risk includes, but is not limited to, interest rate, foreign exchange rate, bond price and equity price risks. Changes in interest rate levels, yield curves and spreads may affect our net interest margin. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and may affect income from foreign exchange dealing. The performance of financial markets or financial conditions generally may cause 18 changes in the value of our investment and trading portfolios. This has been the case during 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, with market volatility resulting in significant reductions in the value of such portfolios. We have implemented risk management methods to mitigate and control these and other market risks to which our portfolios are also exposed. However, it is difficult to predict with accuracy changes in economic or market conditions and to anticipate the effects that such changes could have on our financial performance and business operations. Liquidity Risk. The inability of any bank, including the Bank, to anticipate and provide for unforeseen decreases or changes in funding sources could have consequences on such bank's ability to meet its obligations when they fall due. As a result of the increasingly turbulent conditions in the global financial markets in the second half of 2008, there has been a significant deterioration in the interbank and term funding markets and a consequent material reduction in the availability of longer-term funding. Operational Risk. Operational risk corresponds to the risk of loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, or due to external events, whether deliberate, accidental or natural occurrences. Internal events include, but are not limited to, fraud by employees, clerical and record keeping errors and information systems malfunctions or manipulations. External events include floods, fires, earthquakes, riots or terrorist attacks, fraud by outsiders and equipment failures. Finally, we may also fail to comply with regulatory requirements or conduct of business rules. Insurance Risk. Insurance risk is the risk to earnings due to mismatches between expected and actual claims. Depending on the insurance product, this risk is influenced by macroeconomic changes, changes in customer behavior, changes in public health, pandemics and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, industrial disasters, fires, riots or terrorism. Deteriorating asset valuations resulting from poor market conditions may adversely affect our future earnings. In recent years, Greece and SEE have experienced rapid expansion in the retail and residential mortgage credit markets. An economic slowdown or increase in real interest rates in these countries could result in an increase in non-performing loans and significant changes in the fair values of our exposures. Severe market events, as exemplified by recent events affecting the market for asset-backed CDOs, the US sub-prime residential mortgage market and the leveraged finance sector, are difficult to foresee and, if they occur in markets in which we operate, could result in us incurring significant losses. Moreover, an increase in market volatility or adverse changes in the liquidity of our assets could impair our ability to value certain of our assets and exposures. Valuations in future periods, reflecting then-prevailing market conditions, may result in significant changes in the fair values of these assets and exposures. In addition, the value ultimately realized by us will depend on the fair value as determined at that time and may be materially different from the current or estimated fair value. Any of these factors could require us to recognize write-downs or realize impairment charges, any of which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may incur significant losses on our trading and investment activities due to market fluctuations and volatility. We maintain trading and investment positions in debt, currency, equity and other markets. These positions could be adversely affected by volatility in financial and other markets, creating a risk of substantial losses. Volatility can also lead to losses relating to a broad range of other trading and hedging products we use, including swaps, futures, options and structured products. For further information on market risk exposures in those portfolios, you should refer to Item 11, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk". 19 Our hedging may not prevent losses. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies that we use to hedge economically our exposure to various types of risk in our businesses is not effective, we may incur losses. Many of our strategies are based on historical trading patterns and correlations. Unexpected market developments therefore may adversely affect the effectiveness of our hedging strategies. Moreover, we do not hedge all of our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. In addition, the methodology by which gains and losses resulting from certain ineffective hedges are recorded may result in additional volatility in our reported earnings. An interruption in or a breach of security in our information systems may result in business disruptions and other losses. We rely on communications and information systems provided by third parties to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, and servicing and/or loan organization systems. We cannot provide assurances that such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions could result in a loss of customer data and an inability to service our customers, which could result in a loss of customers or have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. State-related entities may have an important influence on the Bank. In addition to representation on the Board of Directors as a result of our participation in the Hellenic Republic bank support plan, and any direct holding of our ordinary shares it may acquire in the Rights Offering, the Hellenic Republic may exercise a degree of indirect influence on us, through certain state-related entities (primarily pension funds, most of whose boards of directors are appointed by the Hellenic Republic). As of June 2, 2009, domestic pension funds owned approximately 17.3% of our share capital, and other domestic public sector related legal entities and the Church of Greece owned approximately 7.6%. If there is not a full voting participation by all of our shareholders at a given shareholders' meeting, these state-related entities, despite holding a minority of our total shares, may have a voting majority at such meeting. See Item 7.A, "Major ShareholdersState Interests". Future acquisitions may result in unexpected losses. Our strategy includes expansion by acquisition, and acquisitions may lead to unexpected losses or integration difficulties. Typically, when we acquire a banking business, we acquire all of its liabilities as well as its assets. Our acquisition procedures may fail to identify all actual or potential liabilities of a company prior to its acquisition, and we may be unable to obtain sufficient indemnities to protect ourselves against such acquired liabilities. Furthermore, our acquisition procedures may fail to identify that the values of certain assets are impaired. For example, the failure to identify and accurately determine the level of credit risk or market risk to which an acquired bank is exposed prior to its acquisition may lead to unexpected losses following the acquisition, which may have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we may not realize expected synergies which may impact our results, and management may be distracted. Regulation of the banking industry may change. Regulations governing the banking and financial services industries are subject to change, particularly in the current market environment, where there have been unprecedented levels of government intervention and changes to the regulations governing financial institutions. As a result of 20 these and other ongoing and possible future changes in the financial services regulatory landscape (including requirements imposed by virtue of our participation in any government or regulator-led initiatives, such as the Hellenic Republic bank support plan), we may face greater regulation in Greece, Turkey and SEE. Compliance with such changes may increase our capital requirements and costs, heighten disclosure requirements, restrict certain types of transactions, affect our strategy and limit or require the modification of rates or fees that we charge on certain loan and other products, any of which could lower the return on its investments, assets and equity. We may also face increased compliance costs and limitations on our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. Risks Relating to the Markets Exchange rate fluctuations could have a significant impact on the value of our shares. The market price of our shares traded on the Athens Exchange ("ATHEX") is denominated in euro. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and other currencies may affect the value of the Bank's shares in the local currency of investors in the United States and other countries that have not adopted the euro as their currency. Additionally, cash dividends on our ordinary shares are paid in euro and, therefore, are subject to exchange rate fluctuations when converted to an investor's local currency, including US dollars. The ATHEX is less liquid than other major exchanges. The principal trading market for our ordinary shares is the ATHEX. The ATHEX is less liquid than major stock markets in Western Europe and the United States. As a result, shareholders may have difficulty assessing the past performance of the shares based on our prior trading record on the ATHEX. In 2008, the average daily trading value on the ATHEX was approximately €315.9 million, while in the first six months of 2009 it was approximately €171.1 million. In comparison, the average daily trading value on the London Stock Exchange was approximately €7,423 million in 2008. As at December 31, 2008, the aggregate market value of all shares listed on the ATHEX was approximately €68.2 billion, while as at June 30, 2009 it was approximately €82.4 billion. The market value of our ordinary shares listed on the ATHEX on December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2009 was €6,556 million and €7,917 million, representing approximately 9.6% and 11.9%, respectively, of the capitalization of all companies listed on the ATHEX. We cannot make assurances about the future liquidity of the market for our shares. Our share price has been, and may continue to be, volatile. The market price of our shares has been subject to significant volatility in the past, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following: Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; Results of operations of our competitors; The condition of the Greek economy and other economies in which we do business; Potential changes in banking regulatory regimes; Potential or actual sales of large amounts of the Bank's shares into the market; Our competitors' positions in the market; Changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; Conditions and trends in the banking sector in Greece and elsewhere in Europe; and The general state of the securities markets (with particular emphasis on the Greek, SEE and financial services sectors). 21 The exercise of pre-emptive rights may not be available to US holders of the Bank's ordinary shares and American Depositary Receipts. Under Greek law and our Articles of Association, prior to the issuance of any new ordinary shares, we must offer holders of our existing ordinary shares pre-emptive rights to subscribe and pay for a sufficient number of ordinary shares to maintain their existing ownership percentages. These pre-emptive rights are generally transferable during the rights trading period for the related offering and may be traded on the ATHEX. US holders of the Bank's ordinary shares and American Depositary Shares evidenced by American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs") may not be able to receive, trade or exercise pre-emptive rights for any such offering of shares unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is effective with respect to such rights or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. Our decision to file a registration statement with respect to any future offering will depend on the costs and potential liabilities associated with any such registration statement, as well as the perceived benefits of enabling US holders of ordinary shares and ADRs to exercise their pre-emptive rights and any other factors we may consider appropriate at the time. If US holders of the Bank's ordinary shares and ADRs are not able to receive (and trade) or exercise pre-emptive rights granted in respect of their shares in any rights offering by us then they might not receive the economic benefit of such rights. In addition, their proportional ownership interests in the Bank will be diluted.
