Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained or incorporated by reference in this report. See Forward-Looking Statements set forth above. We may not be able to anticipate or react to changes in merchandise trends and consumer demands and our failure to do so may lead to loss of sales and reduced profitability. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in merchandise trends in a timely manner. Any delay or failure by us in identifying and accurately responding to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our product offerings, which could lead to significant markdowns and reduced sales and profitability. In addition, we make decisions for a portion of our merchandise well in advance of each of the seasons in which such merchandise will be sold. Significant deviations from projected demand for merchandise could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales due to insufficient inventory or lower margins due to the need to mark down excess inventory. We may not be able to attract or retain a sufficient number of customers in an extremely competitive retail business market, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The female teen specialty apparel business is highly competitive. We compete against a large number of multi-store specialty apparel companies as well as department store and mass merchant operators, many of whom are larger and have more substantial financial and operational resources. All of our existing locations face competition from one or more of our competitors. This competitive marketplace may adversely affect our future performance and we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively in the future. If we are unable to implement our growth strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability and cash flow could be significantly impaired. An increase in our sales, profitability and cash flow will depend on our ability to execute the following components of our growth strategy: • Increase the number of stores we operate; • Increase the productivity and profitability of our existing stores; • Increase the number of plus-sized departments in existing stores; • Continue our program of selectively remodeling existing stores; and • Continue to selectively close those locations that we believe cannot become profitable or maintain profitability. Accomplishing our store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including locating suitable sites, negotiating favorable lease terms and hiring and training qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level. If we are unable to effectively implement our growth strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability and cash flow could be significantly impaired by, among other things: • The costs of opening and operating new stores may offset the increased sales generated by the additional stores; • The opening of additional stores in an existing market could reduce net sales from existing stores in that market; • The opening of stores in new geographic markets may present competitive challenges that are different than those we face in our existing geographic markets; and • The costs associated with increasing the number of plus-sized departments in existing stores may not be recouped by increases in sales volumes in those locations. 5 Back to Contents Our levels of sales and earnings growth have fluctuated, and any decline in our future growth or performance could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. A variety of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our rate of growth and performance. These factors include, among other things, customer trends and preferences, competition, economic conditions, managing inventory effectively and new store openings. There can be no assurance that we will achieve positive levels of sales and earnings growth and any decline in our future growth or performance could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Our business could be significantly disrupted if we cannot retain or replace members of our management team. Our success depends to a significant extent both upon the continued services of our current executive and senior management team, as well as our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel in the future. Our operations could be adversely affected if, for any reason, one or more key executive officers ceased to be active in our management. We rely on foreign sources of production. We purchase a significant portion of our apparel directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources. We face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, including: • Political instability; • Increased security requirements applicable to imported goods; • Imposition or increases of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; • Imposition of quotas on imported merchandise; • Currency and exchange risks; • Delays in shipping; and • Increased costs of transportation. New initiatives may be proposed that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that, if enacted, could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries. The future performance of our business will depend on foreign suppliers and may be adversely affected by the factors listed above, all of which are beyond our control. This may result in our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise or increase our cost, thereby negatively impacting sales, gross profit and net earnings. We depend on mall and strip shopping center customer traffic. Our sales are dependent in part on a high volume of mall and strip shopping center customer traffic. Mall and strip shopping center customer traffic may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic downturns, gasoline prices, the closing of anchor stores or changes in customer shopping preferences. A decline in the popularity of mall and strip shopping centers among our target customers could have a material adverse effect on customer traffic and reduce our sales and net earnings. A weak fourth quarter would have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the year. Our business is affected by the seasonality pattern that is common to most retailers. Due to the importance of our peak selling season, which includes the Christmas holiday, the fourth quarter has historically contributed, and is expected to continue to contribute, a significant portion of our net income for the entire year. In anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth quarter, we incur significant additional costs both prior to and during the fourth quarter. Those costs include, among other things, the acquisition of inventory and the hiring of seasonal employees. Any factors negatively affecting our sales during this period of the year, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the entire year. 6 Back to Contents We depend on a single distribution center, a disruption in the operation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We process 100% of the merchandise sold in our stores through our automated distribution center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Our distribution operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from events such as fire, flood, power interruption, technological difficulties and similar events. An extended disruption in our ability to process merchandise through our distribution center could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our management information systems may prove inadequate. We depend heavily on our management information systems for many aspects of our business. A significant portion of our key software applications have been developed internally. Additionally, we operate our management information systems with an informal business continuity plan. Our business could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted for an extended period of time. Fluctuations in the cost of fuel oil could impact our earnings and margins. Prices for oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have risen substantially in fiscal 2006. These fluctuations impact our distribution costs, transportation costs for our field management and utility costs for our stores, corporate office and distribution center. Continuing fluctuation of the cost of fuel oil could impact our earnings and margins. Weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. Because a significant portion of our business is apparel and subject to weather conditions in our markets, our operating results may be unexpectedly and adversely affected by inclement weather. Extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets, potentially during our peak seasons, could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect our business. Additionally, frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Labor conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. Our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and growing number of quality sales associates. Many of those sales associates are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. Changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality sales associates could adversely affect our performance. Our principal shareholders may effectively exercise control over matters requiring shareholder approval. Marvin Rounick and Warren Weiner, together with their affiliates, own, directly or indirectly, a substantial amount of our common stock. To the extent they and their affiliates vote their shares in the same manner, their combined stock ownership may effectively give them power to elect all of the directors and control the management, operations and affairs of Deb Shops, Inc. Their ownership may discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in Deb Shops, Inc. even if we needed the investment to operate our business. The size of their combined stock holdings could be a significant factor in delaying or preventing a change of control transaction that other shareholders may deem to be in their best interests, such as a transaction in which the other shareholders would receive a premium for their shares over their current trading prices. 7 Back to Contents Terrorist attacks and threats or actual war may impact all aspects of our operations, revenues, costs and stock price in unpredictable ways. Terrorist attacks in the United States, as well as future events occurring in response or in connection with them, may impact our operations, including among other things, causing delays or losses in the delivery of merchandise to us and decreased sales. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. This also could result in a deepening of any economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results, revenues and costs and may result in the volatility of the market price for our common stock and on the future price of our common stock.
