ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Factors Affecting the Future Operations On April 9, 2006, LMK Global Resources and its wholly owned subsidiary, Larscom Inc., filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the Court). On June 15, 2006, we completed the sale of substantially all of our assets to SCS Fund L.P. for (i) $5,250,000 in cash paid at closing, (ii) the assumption of certain assumed liabilities and (iii) the payment of certain Cure Costs as defined in the Agreement. In January 2007, the Court approved the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) of LMK and Larscom, which included (i) the sale of the LMK shell to an outside investor group, and (ii) the creation of a Liquidating Trust that will be responsible for, among other things, payments to the unsecured creditors pursuant to the Plan. Following the sale of substantially all assets, we ceased operations. On January 17, 2008, the Court issued the Order Granting Motion of Liquidating Trustee to Extend Certain Deadlines Established in the Debtors Plan of Reorganization. On January 31, 2007, the Court approved the Second Amended Plan. Under the Plan, the Company was required to reorganize as a business by February 13, 2009, to receive a discharge of debts under Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to the requirement, the Company entered into an Option Agreement with Osage Land Company to acquire 90% of oil and gas leases owned by Osage Land Company in a certain tract in the state of Colorado. On February 10, 2009, the Company mailed copies to all creditors. No objections were filed with the Bankruptcy Court regarding the Plan to enter into an Option Agreement with Osage Land for the purpose of becoming an exploration stage company focused on the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties. On January 10, 2009, the Company entered into an Option Agreement with Osage Land Company to acquire certain oil and gas leases covering approximately 3,912 of oil and gas leases located in the State of Colorado. 5 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: A) ANY FUTURE JOINT VENTURE, NEW BUSINESS COMBINATION OR SALE OF COMMON SHARES MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE OF CONTROL AND/OR MANAGEMENT OF THE REORGANIZED COMPANY; B) THE TERMS OF ANY FUTURE JOINT VENTURE, BUSINESS COMBINATION, LOAN OR SALE OF COMMON SHARES ARE UNCERTAIN AND, THEREFORE, THE POTENTIAL EFFECT ON INVESTORS IS UNCERTAIN; C) EVEN IF COMPANY MERGES WITH A PRIVATE ENTITY, THE COMBINED ENTITY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO QUALIFY TO TRADE ON A PUBLIC MARKET; D) EVEN IF THE COMPANY MERGES WITH A PRIVATE ENTITY, THE COMBINED ENTITY FACES A MYRIAD OF PROBLEMS THAT ANY COMPANY MAY FACE IN TODAYS ECONOMIC CLIMATE, AND MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL. E) ANY BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY RESULT IN THE EQUITY INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PLAN, BEING FURTHER DILUTED AND, THEREFORE, BEING OF LITTLE OR NO VALUE; F) A MARKET MAY NOT EXIST FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK; G) THE COMPANY IS CONTROLLED BY IACE INVESTMENTS TWO, INC. AS SUCH, THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS HAVE NO MEANINGFUL INPUT INTO THE DIRECTION OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS INVESTING IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY MATERIALIZES, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD SUFFER. The Companys business is subject to numerous risk factors, including the following: 1. The Company is an exploration and/or development stage company that has had no operating history since June 2006, nor any revenues or earnings from operations and it is insolvent. The Company has no assets or financial resources. It will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until additional funding is sustained or the consummation of a joint venture or future business combination. This may result in the Company incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until it can secure additional funding or can consummate a joint venture or business combination with a profitable oil and gas company. There is no assurance that the Company can identify such a future business opportunity and consummate such a joint venture or business combination. 2. As an exploration and/or development stage company, the Company faces substantial additional adverse business and legal consequences. The Company may enter into a joint venture or business combination with an entity that shares a similar venture as the Company. A joint venture or business opportunity may attempt to avoid what it deems to be adverse consequences of undertaking its own public offering by seeking a joint venture or business combination with us. Such consequences may include, but are not limited to, time delays of the registration process, significant expenses to be incurred in such an offering, loss of voting control to public shareholders and the inability or unwillingness to comply with various federal and state laws enacted for the protection of investors. 6 On June 29, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules amending the Form S-8 and the Form 8-K for shell companies. The amendments expand the definition of a shell company to be broader than a company with no or nominal operations/assets or assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents. The amendments prohibit the use of a Form S-8 (a form used by a corporation to register securities issued to an employee, director, officer, consultant or advisor), under certain circumstances, and revised the Form 8-K to require a shell company to include current Form 10 information, including audited financial statements, in the filing on Form 8-K that the shell company files to report the acquisition of the business opportunity. This initial filing must be made within four days of the acquisition. The Form 8-K filing may be reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the prospects of certain disclosures or review or the lack of the ability to issue securities using a Form S-8 may delay the consummation of a business combination because of the target entity's inability to comply with various federal and state laws enacted for the protection of investors or the unwillingness to assume the significant costs of compliance. 3. The Companys Common Stock may never be widely traded and any shareholder may have no ability to sell the shares. While the Companys stock has a trading symbol to facilitate trades on the OTC Bulletin Board there is no significant public trading market for the shares of Common Stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that a liquid market for the Common Stock will be established or that, if established, a market will be sustained. Therefore, the investor may be unable to sell the shares. Accordingly, the investor should be able to bear the financial risk of losing the entire investment. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None
