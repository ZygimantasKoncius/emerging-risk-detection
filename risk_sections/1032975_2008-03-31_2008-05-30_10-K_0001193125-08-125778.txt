ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operating results are difficult to predict and fluctuations in results may cause volatility in the price of our shares. Our revenues and profitability are difficult to predict due to the nature of the markets in which we compete and for many other reasons, including the following:  Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Customers generally order on an as-needed basis and we typically do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. As a result, our revenues in any quarter depend primarily on orders booked and shipped in that quarter.  A significant portion of our quarterly retail sales typically occurs in the last month of each quarter, further increasing the difficulty in predicting quarterly revenues and profitability.  We must incur a large portion of our costs in advance of sales orders, because we must plan research and production, order components, buy tooling equipment, and enter into development, sales and marketing, and other operating commitments prior to obtaining firm commitments from our customers. This makes it difficult for us to adjust our costs during the quarter in response to a revenue shortfall, which could adversely affect our operating results.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can impact our revenues, expenses and profitability because we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars, whereas a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are in other currencies. We seek to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations and currency-driven competitive pricing actions by lowering or raising selling prices in a currency in order to avoid disparity with U.S. dollar prices and to respond to such actions. These efforts may not be successful. Fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results in a given quarter to be below the expectations of financial analysts and investors, which could cause the price of our shares to decline. If we fail to successfully innovate in our current and emerging product categories, our business and operating results could suffer. The personal peripherals industry is characterized by short product life cycles, frequent new product introductions, rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. As a result, we must continually innovate in our current and emerging product categories, introduce new products and technologies, and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. The success of our products depends on several factors, including our ability to:  identify new feature or product opportunities;  anticipate technology, market trends and consumer demands;  develop innovative and reliable new products and enhancements in a cost-effective and timely manner; and  distinguish our products from those of our competitors. If we do not execute on these factors successfully, products that we introduce or technologies or standards that we adopt may not gain widespread commercial acceptance, and our business and operating results could suffer. In addition, if we do not continue to distinguish our products, particularly our retail products, through distinctive, technologically advanced features, designs, and services, as well as continue to build and strengthen our brand recognition and our access to distribution channels, our business could be harmed. 18 Table of Contents Our gross margins can vary significantly depending on multiple factors, which can result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results. Our gross margins can vary due to consumer demand, competition, product life cycle, new product introductions, unit volumes, commodity and supply chain costs, geographic sales mix, and the complexity and functionality of new product innovations. In particular, if we are not able to introduce new products in a timely manner at the product cost we expect, or if consumer demand for our products is less than we anticipate, or if there are product pricing, marketing and other initiatives by our competitors to which we need to react that lower our margins, then our overall gross margin will be less than we project. In addition, our gross margins may vary significantly by product line, sales geography and customer type, as well as within product lines. When the mix of products sold shifts from higher margin product lines to lower margin product lines, to lower margin sales geographies, or to lower-margin products within product lines, our overall gross margins and our profitability may be adversely affected. The impact of these factors on gross margins can create unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results, which may cause volatility in the price of our shares. If we do not compete effectively, demand for our products could decline and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our industry is intensely competitive. It is characterized by short product life cycles, continual performance enhancements, and rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors in our retail market, and price sensitivity in the OEM market. We continue to experience aggressive price competition and other promotional activities from our primary competitors and from less-established brands. From time to time we adjust prices or increase other promotional activities to improve our competitive position. We may also encounter more competition if any of our competitors decide to enter other markets in which we currently operate. In addition, we have been expanding the categories of products we sell, and entering new markets, such as the market for programmable remote controls, streaming media devices and home or small business video security. As we do so, we are confronting new competitors, many of which have more experience in the categories or markets and have greater marketing resources and brand name recognition than we have. In addition, because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics, we expect greater competition in the future from well-established consumer electronics companies in our developing categories, as well as future ones we might enter. Many of these companies have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we have. We expect continued competitive pressure in both our retail and OEM business, including in the terms and conditions that our competitors offer customers, which may be more favorable than our terms and conditions and may require us to take actions to increase our customer incentive programs, which could impact our revenues and operating margins. Pointing Devices, Keyboards and Desktops. Microsoft is our main competitor in the mice, keyboard and desktop product lines. Microsoft has significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base. We are also experiencing competition and pricing pressure for corded and cordless mice and desktops from less-established brands, in the lower-price bands, which could potentially impact our market share. The notebook peripheral category is also an area where we face aggressive pricing and promotions, as well as new competitors that have broader notebook product offerings than we do. Video. Our competitors for PC Web cameras include Microsoft, Creative Labs and Philips. We are encountering aggressive pricing practices and promotions on a worldwide basis, which have impacted our 19 Table of Contents revenues and margins. The worldwide market for PC webcams has also slowed significantly in the last fifteen months, and as a result, pricing practices and promotions by our competitors have become more aggressive. Microsoft is a leading producer of operating systems and applications with which our mice, keyboards and webcams are designed to operate. As a result, Microsoft may be able to improve the functionality of its own peripherals to correspond with ongoing enhancements to its operating systems and software applications before we are able to make such improvements. This ability could provide Microsoft with significant lead-time advantages. In addition, Microsoft may be able to offer pricing advantages on bundled hardware and software products that we may not be able to offer. Audio. Competitors in audio devices vary by product line. In the PC, mobile entertainment and communication platform speaker business, competitors include Plantronics and its Altec Lansing subsidiary, Creative Labs, and Bose Corporation. In the PC headset and microphone business, our main competitors include Plantronics and its Altec Lansing subsidiary. We have expanded our audio product portfolio to include network-based audio systems for digital music, an emerging market with several small competitors as well as larger established consumer electronics companies, like Sony and Philips. Gaming. Competitors for our interactive entertainment products include Intec, Pelican Accessories, Mad Catz and its Saitek subsidiary. Our controllers for PlayStation also compete against controllers offered by Sony. Remotes. Our competitors for remotes include, among others, Philips, Universal Remote, Universal Electronics, RCA and Sony. We expect that the growth in recent years in consumer demand for personal peripheral devices for home entertainment systems will likely result in increased competition. If we do not compete effectively, demand for our products could decline, our gross margin could decrease, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. If we do not successfully continue to innovate and market products for notebook PCs, our business and results of operations may suffer. We have historically targeted peripherals for the PC platform, a market that is dynamically changing as a result of the increasing popularity of notebook and mobile products over desktop PCs. In our OEM channel, this shift has adversely affected our sales of OEM mice, which are sold with name-brand desktop PCs. Our OEM mice sales have historically made up the bulk of our OEM sales, and our OEM sales accounted for 13% and 11% of total revenues during fiscal years 2008 and 2007. If the desktop PC market continues to experience slower growth or decline, and if we do not continue to successfully diversify our OEM business, our OEM revenues could be adversely affected. In our retail channels, the growing popularity of notebook PCs, which are sold by retailers without peripherals, creates opportunities to sell products to consumers to help make their notebook more productive and comfortable. If we do not continue to innovate and successfully market products designed for notebook PCs and other mobile devices, our business and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, the increasing popularity of notebook PCs may result in a decreased demand by consumers for keyboards and desktops, which could negatively affect our sales of these products. If we do not continue to improve our product demand forecasting, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We use our forecasts of product demand to make decisions regarding investments of our resources and production levels of our products. Although we receive forecasts from our customers, many are not obligated to purchase the forecasted demand. Also, actual sales volumes for individual products in our retail distribution channel can be volatile due to changes in consumer preferences and other reasons. In addition, our retail products 20 Table of Contents have short product life cycles, so a failure to accurately predict high demand for a product can result in lost sales that we may not recover in subsequent periods, or higher product costs if we meet demand by paying higher costs for materials, production and delivery. We could also frustrate our customers and lose shelf space. Our failure to predict low demand for a product can result in excess inventory, lower cash flows and lower margins if we are required to reduce product prices in order to reduce inventories. Over the past few years, we have rapidly and significantly expanded the number and types of products we sell, and the geographic markets in which we sell them, and we will endeavor to further expand our product portfolio and sales reach. The growth of our product portfolio and our sales markets has increased the difficulty of accurately forecasting product demand. We have experienced large differences between our forecasts and actual demand for our products and expect differences to arise in the future. If we do not continue to improve the accuracy of our forecasts, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our business depends in part on access to third-party platforms or technologies, and if the access is withdrawn, denied, or is not available on terms acceptable to us, or if the platforms or technologies change without notice to us, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In recent years we have expanded our product portfolio to include products designed for use with third-party platforms such as the Apple iPod, Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation, and Nintendo Wii. The growth of our business is in part due to sales of these products. However, our business in these categories relies on our access to the platforms of third parties, which can be withdrawn, denied or not be available on terms acceptable to us. Our access to third-party platforms may require paying a royalty, which lowers our product margins, or may otherwise be on terms that are not acceptable to us. In addition, the third-party platforms or technologies used to interact with our product portfolio can change without prior notice to us, which can result in our having excess inventory or lower margins. If we are unable to access third-party platforms or technologies, or if our access is withdrawn, denied, or is not available on terms acceptable to us, or if the platforms or technologies change without notice to us, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our principal manufacturing operations and third-party contract manufacturers are located in China, which exposes us to risks associated with doing business in that country. Our principal manufacturing operations and third-party contract manufacturers are located in China. Our manufacturing operations in Suzhou, China could be severely impacted by changes in the interpretation and enforcement of legal standards, by strains on Chinas energy, transportation, communications, trade, public health and other infrastructures, by conflicts, embargoes, increased tensions or escalation of hostilities between China and Taiwan, and by other trade customs and practices that are dissimilar to those in the United States and Europe. Interpretation and enforcement of Chinas laws and regulations continue to evolve and we expect differences in interpretation and enforcement to continue in the foreseeable future. Our Suzhou facilities are managed by several of our key Taiwanese expatriate employees. The loss of these employees, either voluntarily or as a consequence of deterioration in relations between China and Taiwan, could diminish the productivity and effectiveness of our Suzhou manufacturing operations. Further, we may be exposed to fluctuations in the value of the Chinese renminbi (CNY), the local currency of China. Significant future appreciation of the CNY could increase our component and other raw material costs, as well as our labor costs, and could adversely affect our financial results. 21 Table of Contents We purchase key components and products from a limited number of sources, and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply were delayed or constrained or if there were shortages of required components. We purchase certain products and key components from a limited number of sources. If the supply of these products or key components, such as micro-controllers and optical sensors, were to be delayed or constrained, we may be unable to find a new supplier on acceptable terms, or at all, or our product shipments to our customers could be delayed, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Lead times for materials, components and products ordered by us or by our contract manufacturers can vary significantly and depend on factors such as contract terms, demand for a component, and supplier capacity. From time to time, we have experienced component shortages. We continue to experience extended lead times on semiconductors, such as micro-controllers and optical sensors, and base metals used in our products. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of components or subcontracted products, or our inability to procure these components or products from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could delay shipment of our products or increase our production costs, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we do not successfully coordinate the worldwide manufacturing and distribution of our products, we could lose sales. Our business requires us to coordinate the manufacture and distribution of our products over much of the world. We increasingly rely on third parties to manufacture our products, manage centralized distribution centers, and transport our products. If we do not successfully coordinate the timely manufacturing and distribution of our products, we may have insufficient supply of products to meet customer demand and we could lose sales, or we may experience a build-up in inventory. We rely on commercial air freight carriers, ocean freight carriers, trucking companies and other transportation companies for the movement of our products. Consequently, our ability to ship products to our distribution centers could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity. The logistics and supply chain infrastructure in China, where our products are manufactured, has not kept pace with the rapid expansion of Chinas economy, resulting in periodic capacity constraints in the transportation of goods. If we are unable to secure cost-effective freight resources in a timely manner, we could incur incremental costs to expedite delivery, which could adversely affect our gross margins, and we could experience delays in bringing our products to market, resulting in lost product sales or the accumulation of excess inventory. Air and ground transportation costs remain under upward pressure primarily due to high fuel costs. Continued increases in the worldwide cost of fuel could result in higher transportation costs, which could adversely affect gross margins. A significant portion of our quarterly retail orders and product deliveries generally occur in the last month of the fiscal quarter. This places pressure on our supply chain and could adversely impact our revenues and profitability if we are unable to successfully fulfill customer orders in the quarter. We conduct operations in a number of countries and the effect of business, legal and political risks associated with international operations could significantly harm us. We conduct operations in a number of countries. There are risks inherent in doing business in international markets, including:  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;  compliance with laws and regulations, including environmental and tax laws, which vary from country to country and over time, increasing the costs of compliance and potential risks of non-compliance;  exposure to political and financial instability, leading to currency exchange losses and collection difficulties or other losses; 22 Table of Contents  exposure to fluctuations in the value of local currencies;  difficulties or increased costs in establishing sales and distribution channels in unfamiliar markets, with their own market characteristics and competition, particularly in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia;  changes in value-added tax (VAT) or VAT reimbursement;  imposition of currency exchange controls; and  delays from customs brokers or government agencies. Any of these risks could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of our technology may result in the development of products that compete with our products. Our future success depends in part on our proprietary technology, technical know-how and other intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws, and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions such as nondisclosure terms and licenses, to protect our intellectual property. We hold various United States patents and pending applications, together with corresponding patents and pending applications from other countries. It is possible that any patent owned by us will be invalidated, deemed unenforceable, circumvented or challenged, that the patent rights granted will not provide competitive advantages to us, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will not be issued. In addition, other intellectual property laws or our confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Also, others may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around our patents or other intellectual property rights. Unauthorized parties have copied and may in the future attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Product quality issues could adversely affect our reputation and could impact our operating results. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. To remain competitive, we must continually introduce new products and technologies. The products that we sell could contain defects in design or manufacture. Defects could also occur in the products or components that are supplied to us. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and remedy all defects in the hardware and software we sell. Failure to do so could result in product recalls, product redesign efforts, lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses to remedy. Our effective tax rates may increase in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. We operate in multiple jurisdictions and our profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate may be affected by changes in or interpretations of tax laws in any given jurisdiction, utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, changes in geographical allocation of income and expense, and changes in managements assessment of matters such as the realizability of deferred tax assets. In the past, we have experienced fluctuations in our effective income tax rate. Our effective income tax rate in a given fiscal year reflects a variety of factors that may not be present in the succeeding fiscal year or years. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, the recording of a discrete event related to the other-than-temporary decline in the estimated fair value of short-term investments caused the effective income tax rate to be 40.1%, as compared with 10.9% in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. There is no assurance that our effective income tax rate will not change in future periods. The amount of income taxes we pay could be subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. If our effective tax rate increases in future periods, our net income could be adversely affected. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
