Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this report, investors should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating the Company’s business. Revlon, Inc. is a holding company with no business operations of its own and is dependent on its subsidiaries to pay certain expenses and dividends. In addition, shares of the capital stock of Products Corporation, Revlon, Inc.'s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, are pledged by Revlon, Inc. to secure its obligations under the Amended Credit Agreements.Revlon, Inc. is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Revlon, Inc.’s only material asset is all of the outstanding capital stock of Products Corporation, Revlon, Inc.’s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, through which Revlon, Inc. conducts its business operations. As such, Revlon, Inc.’s net (loss) income has historically consisted predominantly of its equity in the net income of Products Corporation, which for 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $1.6 million, $71.2 million and $64.0 million, respectively (which excluded $8.1 million, $19.3 million and $7.4 million, respectively, in expenses primarily related to Revlon, Inc. being a public holding company). Revlon, Inc. is dependent on the earnings and cash flow of, and dividends and distributions from, Products Corporation to pay Revlon, Inc.’s expenses incidental to being a public holding company and to pay any cash dividend or distribution on its Class A Common Stock in each case that may be authorized by Revlon, Inc.’s Board of Directors. Products Corporation may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends or distribute funds to Revlon, Inc. because, for example, Products Corporation may not generate sufficient cash or net income; state laws may restrict or prohibit Products Corporation from issuing dividends or making distributions unless Products Corporation has sufficient surplus or net profits, which Products Corporation may not have; or because contractual restrictions, including negative covenants contained in Products Corporation’s various debt instruments, may prohibit or limit such dividends or distributions.The terms of the Amended Term Loan Agreement and the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement (together, the "Amended Credit Agreements"), the indenture governing the 5¾% Senior Notes (the "5¾% Senior Notes Indenture") and the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement generally restrict Products Corporation from paying dividends or advancing or making distributions to Revlon, Inc. except in limited circumstances (including, without limitation, that Products Corporation is permitted to pay dividends and advance and make distributions to Revlon, Inc. to enable Revlon, Inc., among other things, to pay expenses incidental to being a public holding company, including, among other things, professional fees such as legal, accounting and insurance fees, regulatory fees, such as SEC filing fees, NYSE listing fees and other expenses related to being a public holding company and, subject to certain limitations, to pay dividends, if any, on Revlon, Inc.’s outstanding securities or make distributions in certain circumstances to finance the purchase by Revlon, Inc. of its Class A Common Stock in connection with the delivery of such Class A Common Stock to grantees under the Third Amended and Restated Revlon, Inc. Stock Plan). This limitation therefore restricts Revlon, Inc.'s ability to pay dividends on its Class A Common Stock. All of the shares of the capital stock of Products Corporation held by Revlon, Inc. are pledged to secure Revlon, Inc.’s guarantee of Products Corporation's obligations under the Amended Credit Agreements. A foreclosure upon the shares of Products Corporation's common stock would result in Revlon, Inc. no longer holding its only material asset and would have a material adverse effect on the holders of Revlon, Inc.’s Common Stock and would be a change of control under Products Corporation’s other debt instruments. (See also “Risk Factors - Shares of Revlon, Inc. Class A Common Stock and Products Corporation’s capital stock are pledged to secure various of Revlon, Inc.’s and/or other of the Company’s affiliates’ obligations and foreclosure upon these shares or dispositions of shares could result in the acceleration of debt under the Amended Credit Agreements and the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture and could have other consequences.”)10Products Corporation’s substantial indebtedness, including the additional Acquisition Term Loan which it used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition, could adversely affect the Company’s operations and flexibility and Products Corporation’s ability to service its debt.Products Corporation has a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. In connection with closing the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation incurred an additional $700.0 million Acquisition Term Loan under the Amended Term Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2013, the Company’s total indebtedness was $1,942.2 million (or $1,935.6 million net of discounts), primarily including $700.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan, $675.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan, $500.0 million in aggregate principal face amount outstanding of Products Corporation's 5¾% Senior Notes and $58.4 million under the Non-Contributed Loan (as hereinafter defined). Incurring the Acquisition Term Loan increased the Company’s leverage and the ratio of the Company’s net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. While Revlon, Inc. achieved net income of $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 (which included non-cash benefits of $15.8 million related to reductions of the Company’s deferred tax valuation allowance at December 31, 2012), it recorded a net loss of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and if the Company is unable to achieve sustained profitability and free cash flow in future periods, it could adversely affect the Company's operations and Products Corporation's ability to service its debt and/or comply with the financial and/or operating covenants under its various debt instruments.The Company is subject to the risks normally associated with substantial indebtedness, including the risk that the Company’s operating revenues will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that Products Corporation will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness when it becomes due or, if it is unable to comply with the financial or operating covenants under its debt instruments, to obtain any necessary consents, waivers or amendments or that the terms of any such refinancing and/or consents, waivers or amendments will be less favorable than the current terms of such indebtedness. Products Corporation’s substantial indebtedness could also have the effect of:•limiting the Company’s ability to fund (including by obtaining additional financing) the costs and expenses of the execution of the Company’s business strategy (including activities related to the integration of the Colomer business into the Company’s business), future working capital, capital expenditures, advertising, promotional or marketing expenses, new product development costs, purchases and reconfigurations of wall displays, acquisitions, acquisition integration costs, investments, restructuring programs and other general corporate requirements;•requiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on Products Corporation’s indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow for the execution of the Company’s business strategy and for other general corporate purposes;•placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;•exposing the Company to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under the financial and operating covenants contained in Products Corporation’s debt instruments; •limiting the Company’s flexibility in responding to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and•making the Company more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions or a downturn in its business.Although agreements governing Products Corporation’s indebtedness, including the Amended Credit Agreements, the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture and the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement, limit Products Corporation’s ability to borrow additional money, under certain circumstances Products Corporation is allowed to borrow a significant amount of additional money, some of which, in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations, could be secured indebtedness. To the extent that more debt is added to the Company's current debt levels, the risks described above would increase further.Products Corporation’s ability to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness depends on many factors.The 2011 Term Loan under the Amended Term Loan Facility, with $675.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding, matures in November 2017, the Acquisition Term Loan under the Amended Term Loan Facility, with $700.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding, matures on the sixth anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition Term Loan (or October 8, 2019), the Amended Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of August 14, 2018 and 90 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any term loans then outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility, but not earlier than June 16, 2016, the Non-Contributed Loan matures in October 2014, and the 5¾% Senior Notes mature in February 2021. Products Corporation currently anticipates that, in order to pay the principal amount of its outstanding indebtedness upon the occurrence of any event of default, to repurchase its 5¾% Senior Notes if a change of control occurs, or in the event that Products Corporation’s cash flows from operations are insufficient to allow it to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness at maturity, the Company may be required to refinance Products Corporation’s indebtedness, seek to sell assets or operations, seek to sell additional Revlon, Inc. equity, seek to sell Revlon, Inc. debt securities or Products Corporation debt securities or seek additional capital contributions or loans from MacAndrews & Forbes or from the Company’s other affiliates and/or third parties. The Company may be unable to take any of 11these actions, because of a variety of commercial or market factors or constraints in Products Corporation’s debt instruments, including, for example, market conditions being unfavorable for an equity or debt issuance, additional capital contributions or loans not being available from affiliates and/or third parties, or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of the various debt instruments then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and/or related party transactions. Such actions, if ever taken, may not enable the Company to satisfy its cash requirements or enable Products Corporation to comply with the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements if the actions do not result in sufficient savings or generate a sufficient amount of additional capital, as the case may be.None of the Company’s affiliates are required to make any capital contributions, loans or other payments to Products Corporation regarding its obligations on its indebtedness. Products Corporation may not be able to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness using any of the above actions because, under certain circumstances, the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture or any of its other debt instruments (including the Amended Credit Agreements and the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement) or the debt instruments of Products Corporation’s subsidiaries then in effect may not permit the Company to take such actions. (See "Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation’s debt agreements limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply").The future state of the credit markets, including any volatility and/or tightening of the credit markets and reduction in credit availability, could adversely impact the Company’s ability to refinance or replace Products Corporation’s outstanding indebtedness at or prior to their respective maturity dates, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation’s debt agreements limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply.Agreements governing Products Corporation’s outstanding indebtedness, including the Amended Credit Agreements, the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture and the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement, contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit Products Corporation’s ability (subject in each case to limited exceptions) to, among other things:•borrow money;•use assets as security in other borrowings or transactions;•pay dividends on stock or purchase stock;•sell assets and use the proceeds from such sales;•enter into certain transactions with affiliates;•make certain investments; •prepay, redeem or repurchase specified indebtedness; and•permit restrictions on the payment of dividends to Products Corporation by its subsidiaries.In addition, the Amended Credit Agreements contain financial covenants limiting Products Corporation’s first-lien senior secured debt-to-EBITDA ratio (in the case of the Amended Term Loan Agreement) and, under certain circumstances, requiring Products Corporation to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (in the case of the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement). These covenants affect Products Corporation’s operating flexibility by, among other things, restricting its ability to incur expenses and indebtedness that could otherwise be used to fund the costs of executing the Company’s business strategy (including activities related to the integration of the Colomer business into the Company’s business) and to grow the Company’s business, as well as to fund general corporate purposes.A breach of the Amended Credit Agreements would permit Products Corporation’s lenders to accelerate amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreements, which would in turn constitute an event of default under the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement and the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture, if the amount accelerated exceeds $25.0 million and such default remains uncured for 10 days following notice from (i) the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan (provided that if Revlon, Inc. or Products Corporation held such majority, notice would be required from the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan not held by Revlon, Inc. or Products Corporation at the time of any such decision) or (ii) the trustee or the holders of at least 30% of the outstanding principal amount of the notes under the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture. In addition, holders of Products Corporation’s outstanding 5¾% Senior Notes may require Products Corporation to repurchase their respective notes in the event of a change of control under the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture. Upon a change of control, Products Corporation would be required, after fulfilling its repayment obligations under the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture, to repay in full the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan. (See "Products Corporation’s ability to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness depends on many factors.") Products Corporation may not have sufficient funds at the time of any such breach of 12any such covenant or change of control to repay in full the borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreements or the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement or to repurchase or redeem its outstanding 5¾% Senior Notes.Events beyond the Company’s control could impair the Company’s operating performance, which could affect Products Corporation’s ability to comply with the terms of Products Corporation’s debt instruments. Such events may include decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products; adverse changes in currency exchange rates, currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company’s competitors; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to shopping channels; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional and/or marketing plans; or if the Company’s expenses, including, without limitation, for pension expense under its benefit plans, acquisition-related integration costs, advertising, promotional and/or marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses.Under such circumstances, Products Corporation may be unable to comply with the provisions of its debt instruments, including the financial covenants in the Amended Credit Agreements. If Products Corporation is unable to satisfy such covenants or other provisions at any future time, Products Corporation would need to seek an amendment or waiver of such financial covenants or other provisions. The respective lenders under the Amended Credit Agreements may not consent to any amendment or waiver requests that Products Corporation may make in the future, and, if they do consent, they may only do so on terms that are unfavorable to Products Corporation and/or Revlon, Inc.In the event that Products Corporation is unable to obtain any such waiver or amendment, Products Corporation's inability to meet the financial covenants or other provisions of the Amended Credit Agreements would constitute an event of default under its Amended Credit Agreements, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the Amended Credit Agreements, which in turn would constitute an event of default under the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement, if the amount accelerated exceeds $25.0 million and such default remains uncured for 10 days following notice from the requisite number of lenders under the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan and would constitute an event of default under the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture, if the amount accelerated exceeds $25.0 million and such default remains uncured for 10 days following notice from (i) in the case of the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement, the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan (provided that if Revlon, Inc. or Products Corporation held such majority, notice would be required from the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan not held by Revlon, Inc. or Products Corporation at the time of any such decision) or (ii) in the case of the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture, the trustee or the holders of at least 30% of the outstanding principal amount of such outstanding notes.Products Corporation’s assets and/or cash flow and/or that of Products Corporation’s subsidiaries may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under its outstanding debt instruments, either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default, and if Products Corporation is required to repurchase its outstanding 5¾% Senior Notes or repay the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan or repay the Amended Credit Agreements upon a change of control, Products Corporation may be unable to refinance or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, if Products Corporation is unable to repay, refinance or restructure its indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreements the lenders, subject to certain conditions and limitations as set forth in the third amended and restated intercreditor agreement, could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness.Limits on Products Corporation's borrowing capacity under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility may affect the Company's ability to finance its operations.While the Amended Revolving Credit Facility currently provides for up to $175.0 million of commitments, Products Corporation's ability to borrow funds under such facility is limited by a borrowing base determined relative to the value, from time to time, of eligible trade receivables and eligible inventory in the U.S. and the U.K. and eligible real property and equipment in the U.S. In January 2014, the Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors under Products Corporation’s Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture for the 5¾% Senior Notes. In connection with becoming guarantors, substantially all of the assets of the Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries were pledged as collateral under Products Corporation’s Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, thereby increasing the value of the assets supporting the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.If the value of these eligible assets is not sufficient to support the full $175.0 million borrowing base, Products Corporation will not have full access to the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, but rather could have access to a lesser amount determined by the borrowing base. As Products Corporation continues to manage its working capital, this could reduce the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Further, if Products Corporation borrows funds under such facility, subsequent changes in the value or eligibility of the assets within the borrowing base could cause Products Corporation to be required to pay down the amounts outstanding under such facility so that there is no amount outstanding in excess of the then-existing borrowing base.13Products Corporation's ability to borrow under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is also conditioned upon its compliance with other covenants in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement governing such facility, including a fixed charge coverage ratio that applies when the difference between (1) the borrowing base under such facility and (2) the amounts outstanding under such facility is less than $20.0 million. Because of these limitations, Products Corporation may not always be able to meet its cash requirements with funds borrowed under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.At December 31, 2013, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan and the 2011 Term Loan was $700.0 million and $675.0 million, respectively, with the Company having a liquidity position of $384.7 million, consisting of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (net of any outstanding checks) of $234.5 million, as well as $150.2 million in available borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the calculated borrowing base less $9.8 million of undrawn outstanding letters of credit and nil then drawn under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility at such date. As a result of the Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries becoming additional guarantors under Products Corporation’s Amended Revolving Credit Facility in January 2014, substantially all of their assets were pledged as collateral under Products Corporation’s Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, thereby increasing the value of the assets supporting the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.The Amended Revolving Credit Facility is syndicated to a group of banks and financial institutions. Each bank is responsible to lend its portion of the $175.0 million commitment if and when Products Corporation seeks to draw under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The lenders may assign their commitments to other banks and financial institutions in certain cases without prior notice to Products Corporation. If a lender is unable to meet its lending commitment, then the other lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility have the right, but not the obligation, to lend additional funds to make up for the defaulting lender’s commitment, if any. Products Corporation has never had any of its lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility fail to fulfill their lending commitment. Based on information available to the Company, the Company has no reason to believe that any of the lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility would be unable to fulfill their commitments to lend under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2013. However, it is possible that economic conditions and potential volatility in the financial markets, among other factors, could impact the liquidity and financial condition of certain banks and financial institutions. If one or more lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility were unable to fulfill their commitment to lend, such inability would impact the Company's liquidity and, depending upon the amount involved and the Company's liquidity requirements, could have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to fund its operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.A substantial portion of Products Corporation's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates.A substantial portion of Products Corporation's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes the Company more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates or a downturn in the Company's business. As of December 31, 2013, $1,439.3 million of Products Corporation's total indebtedness (or $1,432.7 million net of discounts), or approximately 74% of Products Corporation's total indebtedness, was subject to floating interest rates. Under the Amended Term Loan Agreement, as of December 31, 2013 the $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan and the $675.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan bear interest, at Products Corporation's option, at either the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement) plus 3.00% per annum (provided that in no event shall the Eurodollar Rate (which is based upon LIBOR) be less than 1.00% per annum), or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement) plus 2.00% per annum, which Alternate Base Rate is based on the greater of Citibank, N.A.’s announced base rate and the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.5% (provided that in no event shall the Alternative Base Rate be less than 2.00% per annum). Pursuant to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment, the interest rates applicable to the $675 million Amended Tranche were reduced such that Eurodollar Loans under the Amended Tranche bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus 2.5% per annum, with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 0.75% (compared to 3.0% and 1.0%, respectively, prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment), while Alternate Base Rate Loans under the Amended Tranche bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 1.5%, with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 1.75% (compared to 2.0% in each case prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment). In November 2013, Products Corporation entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap in a single derivative with a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under the Acquisition Term Loan for a three-year period beginning in May 2015 (the "2013 Interest Rate Swap"). Under the terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, Products Corporation will be required to pay to the counterparty a quarterly fixed interest rate of 2.0709% on the $400 million notional amount, while receiving variable interest rate payments from the counterparty equal to the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00% (which effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at 5.0709% over the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap). While Products Corporation may enter into other interest hedging contracts, it may not be able to do so on a cost-effective basis, and any hedging transactions that Products Corporation enters into may not achieve their intended purpose and shifts in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and/or results of operations. 14At December 31, 2013, the Eurodollar Rate, LIBOR and the Alternate Base Rate were 1.0% (as a result of the Eurodollar Rate floor referred to above), 0.25% and 3.25%, respectively. Pursuant to the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on $400 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Acquisition Term Loan is effectively fixed at 5.0709% beginning in May 2015 through May 2018. Borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility (other than loans in foreign currencies) bear interest at a rate equal to, at Products Corporation's option, either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below, or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below:Excess Availability Alternate Base Rate Loans Eurodollar Loans, Eurocurrency Loan or Local Rate LoansGreater than or equal to $92,000,000 0.50% 1.50%Less than $92,000,000 but greater than or equal to $46,000,000 0.75% 1.75%Less than $46,000,000 1.00% 2.00%Local Loans (as defined in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement) bear interest, if mutually acceptable to Products Corporation and the relevant foreign lenders, at the Local Rate, and otherwise (i) if in foreign currencies or in U.S. Dollars, at the Eurodollar Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above or (ii) if in U.S. Dollars, at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above.Under the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement, the Non-Contributed Loan bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 7%, with a 1.5% LIBOR floor.If any of LIBOR, the base rate, the U.S. federal funds rate or such equivalent local currency rate increases, Product Corporation's debt service costs will increase to the extent that Products Corporation has elected such rates for its outstanding loans. Based on the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreements, the Non-Contributed Loan under the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan and other short-term borrowings (which, in the aggregate, are Products Corporation’s only debt currently subject to floating interest rates) as of December 31, 2013, an increase in LIBOR of 1% would increase the Company’s annual interest expense by $14.6 million. Increased debt service costs would adversely affect the Company's cash flow. The Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of its products within the Consumer segment. Disruptions at this facility, and/or at other Company or third party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured for both its Consumer and Professional segments, could affect the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The Company produces a substantial portion of its products at its Oxford, North Carolina facility. Significant unscheduled downtime at this facility, or at other Company facilities, including those that the Company recently acquired within the Professional segment, and/or third party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured, whether due to equipment breakdowns, power failures, natural disasters, weather conditions hampering delivery schedules or other disruptions, including those caused by transitioning manufacturing across these facilities, or any other cause could adversely affect the Company's ability to provide products to its customers, could affect the Company's sales, business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Additionally, if product sales exceed forecasts or production, the Company could, from time to time, not have an adequate supply of products to meet customer demands, which could cause the Company to lose sales.The Company's new product introductions may not be as successful as the Company anticipates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The Company has a rigorous process for the continuous development and evaluation of new product concepts, led by executives in marketing, sales, research and development, product development, operations, law and finance. Each new product launch, including those resulting from this new product development process, carries risks, as well as the possibility of unexpected consequences, including:• the acceptance of the new product launches by, and sales of such new products to, the Company's customers may not be as high as the Company anticipates;•the Company's advertising, promotional and marketing strategies for its new products may be less effective than planned and may fail to effectively reach the targeted consumer base or engender the desired consumption•the rate of purchases by the Company's consumers may not be as high as the Company anticipates;•the Company's wall displays to showcase its new products may fail to achieve their intended effects;15•the Company may experience out-of-stocks and/or product returns exceeding its expectations as a result of its new product launches or space reconfigurations or reductions in retail display space by its customers or the Company's net sales may be impacted by inventory management by its customers or changes in pricing or promotional strategies by its customers;•the Company may incur costs exceeding its expectations as a result of the continued development and launch of new products, including, for example, advertising, promotional and marketing expenses, sales return expenses or other costs related to launching new products;•the Company may experience a decrease in sales of certain of the Company's existing products as a result of newly-launched products, the impact of which could be exacerbated by shelf space limitations and/or any shelf space loss. (See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-"Competition in the cosmetics, hair and beauty care products business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.")•the Company's product pricing strategies for new product launches may not be accepted by its customers and/or its consumers, which may result in the Company's sales being less than it anticipates; and•any delays or difficulties impacting the Company's ability, or the ability of the Company's suppliers, to timely manufacture, distribute and ship products, displays or display walls in connection with launching new products, such as due to inclement weather conditions or those delays or difficulties discussed under “- The Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of the Company's products within the Consumer segment. Disruptions at this facility, and/or at other Company or third party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured for both its Consumer and Professional segments, could affect the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations,” could affect the Company's ability to ship and deliver products to meet its customers’ reset deadlines.Each of the risks referred to above could delay or impede the Company's ability to achieve its sales objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The Company currently expects that operating revenues, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and other permitted lines of credit will be sufficient to enable the Company to cover its operating expenses for 2014, including cash requirements for the payment of expenses in connection with the execution of the Company's business strategy, integration costs related to the Colomer Acquisition, purchases of permanent wall displays, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments and costs, tax payments, pension and post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs, severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs and debt and/or equity repurchases, if any.If the Company's anticipated level of revenue is not achieved, however, because of, for example, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products; adverse changes in currency exchange rates, currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to shopping channels; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, for pension expense under its benefit plans, integration costs related to the Colomer Acquisition, advertising, promotional or marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company's current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet its cash requirements. In addition, such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company's revenues and could adversely affect Products Corporation's ability to comply with certain financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements.If operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing are insufficient to cover the Company's expenses or are insufficient to enable Products Corporation to comply with the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements, the Company could be required to adopt one or more of the alternatives listed below:•delaying the implementation of or revising certain aspects of the Company's business strategy (including activities related to the integration of the Colomer business into the Company’s business);•reducing or delaying purchases of wall displays or advertising, promotional or marketing expenses;•reducing or delaying capital spending;16•implementing new restructuring programs;•refinancing Products Corporation's indebtedness;•selling assets or operations;•seeking additional capital contributions and/or loans from MacAndrews & Forbes, the Company's other affiliates and/or third parties;•selling additional Revlon, Inc. equity or debt securities or Products Corporation's debt securities; or•reducing other discretionary spending.There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to take any of these actions, because of a variety of commercial or market factors or constraints in Products Corporation's debt instruments, including, for example, market conditions being unfavorable for an equity or a debt issuance, additional capital contributions or loans not being available from affiliates and/or third parties, or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of Products Corporation's various debt instruments then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and/or related party transactions. If the Company is required to take any of these actions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Such actions, if ever taken, may not enable the Company to satisfy its cash requirements or enable Products Corporation to comply with the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements if the actions do not result in sufficient savings or generate a sufficient amount of additional capital, as the case may be. (See “- Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation's debt agreements limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply,” which discusses, among other things, the consequences of noncompliance with Products Corporation's credit agreement covenants).Economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations or on the financial condition of its customers and suppliers.Economic conditions, in the U.S. and/or other countries where the Company operates, have contributed and may continue to contribute to high unemployment levels, lower consumer spending and reduced credit availability, and have impacted and could in the future impact business and consumer confidence. Such conditions could have an impact on consumer purchases and/or customer purchases of the Company's products, which could result in a reduction of net sales, operating income and/or cash flows. Additionally, disruptions in the credit and other financial markets and economic conditions could, among other things, impair the financial condition of one or more of the Company's customers or suppliers, thereby increasing the risk of customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The Company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales, and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce the Company's net sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Walmart and its affiliates worldwide accounted for approximately 21% of the Company’s worldwide net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 22% for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Company expects that, for future periods, Walmart and a small number of other customers in the Consumer and Professional segments will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of the Company's net sales. These customers have demanded, and may continue to demand, increased service and other accommodations. The Company may be affected by changes in the policies and demands of its customers relating to service levels, inventory de-stocking, pricing and promotional strategies or limitations on access to wall display space. As is customary in the consumer products industry, none of the Company's customers is under an obligation to continue purchasing products from the Company in the future.The loss of Walmart or one or more of the Company's other customers that may account for a significant portion of the Company's net sales, or any significant decrease in sales to these customers, including as a result of consolidation among the Company's customers, inventory management by the Company's customers, changes in pricing or promotional strategies by the Company's customers or space reconfigurations by the Company's customers or any significant decrease in the Company's display space, could reduce the Company's net sales and/or operating income and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Declines in the financial markets may result in increased pension expense and increased cash contributions to the Company's pension plans.Declines in the U.S. and global financial markets could result in significant declines in the Company's pension plan assets and result in increased pension expense and cash contributions to the Company's pension plans. Interest rate levels will affect the discount rate used to value the Company's year-end pension benefit obligations. One or more of these factors, individually or taken 17together, could impact future required cash contributions to the Company's pension plans and pension expense. Any one or more of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The Company may be unable to maintain or increase its sales through the Company's primary distribution channels, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.A decrease in consumer demand in the U.S. and internationally for beauty care products, inventory management by the Company's customers, changes in pricing or promotional strategies by the Company's customers, a reduction in display space by the Company's customers and/or a change in consumers’ purchasing habits, such as by buying more cosmetics and beauty care products in channels in which the Company does not currently compete (such as prestige and department stores, television shopping, door-to-door, specialty stores, the internet, perfumeries and other distribution outlets, which combine to account for a significant amount of beauty care sales), could impact sales of the Company's products, which could reduce the Company's net sales and which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Competition in the cosmetics, hair and beauty care products business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations. The cosmetics, hair and beauty care products business is highly competitive. The Company competes primarily by:•developing quality products with innovative performance features, shades, finishes and packaging;•educating consumers and salon professionals about the benefits of the Company’s products;•anticipating and responding to changing consumer and salon professional demands in a timely manner, including the timing of new product introductions and line extensions;•offering attractively priced products, relative to the product benefits provided;•maintaining favorable brand recognition;•generating competitive margins and inventory turns for the Company’s customers by providing relevant products and executing effective pricing, incentive and promotion programs;•ensuring product availability through effective planning and replenishment collaboration with the Company's customers;•providing strong and effective advertising, promotion, marketing and merchandising support;•maintaining an effective sales force and distribution network; and•obtaining and retaining sufficient display space, optimal in-store positioning and effective presentation of the Company’s products on-shelf.An increase in or change in the current level of competition that the Company faces could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.In addition, the Company competes against a number of multi-national manufacturers, some of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company, and which may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively than the Company on advertising, promotions and marketing and have more flexibility than the Company to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The Company's products also compete with similar products sold through channels other than those in which it competes, including prestige and department stores, television shopping, door-to-door, specialty stores, the internet, perfumeries and other distribution outlets.Additionally, the Company's major customers periodically assess the allocation of display space among competitors and in the course of doing so could elect to reduce the display space allocated to the Company's products, if, for example, the Company's marketing strategies for its new and/or existing products are less effective than planned, fail to effectively reach the targeted consumer base, fail to engender the desired consumption and/or fail to sustain productive levels of market share; and/or the rate of purchases by the Company's consumers are not as high as the Company anticipates. Within the Company’s Consumer segment, among the factors used by the Company’s major customers in assessing the allocation of display space is a brand’s share of the color cosmetics category in the U.S. mass retail channel. The Company’s color cosmetics brands have experienced, over time, year-over-year share declines in its color cosmetics brands in the U.S. mass retail channel and it is possible that the Company may continue to experience further share declines. Further declines in the Company’s share in the U.S. mass retail channel, including with respect to the Company’s Almay brand, could, among other things, contribute to a loss of display space and/or decreased revenues. Any significant loss of display space could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.18The Company's foreign operations are subject to a variety of social, political and economic risks and have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by foreign currency fluctuations, currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations and the value of its foreign assets.As of December 31, 2013, the Company had operations based in 24 foreign countries and its products were sold in more than 150 countries. The Company is exposed to risks associated with social, political and economic conditions, including inflation, inherent in operating in foreign countries, including those in Asia (including Japan), Australia, Eastern Europe, South America (including Venezuela and Argentina) and South Africa, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Such risks arise from laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where the Company has operations, hyperinflation, currency devaluation, currency controls, government-mandated pricing controls, currency remittance restrictions, changes in consumer purchasing habits (including as to shopping channels), as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.These risks and limitations could affect the ability of the Company's foreign subsidiaries to obtain sufficient capital to conduct their operations in the ordinary course of business. These limitations and the difficulties that certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries may experience on the free flow of funds to these foreign subsidiaries could restrict the Company's ability to respond timely to challenging market conditions or changes in operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government, which began in 2003, have impacted the ability of Revlon Venezuela to obtain U.S. Dollars in exchange for local currency at the official foreign exchange rates. Revlon Venezuela accounted for approximately 1% of the Company's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, and approximately 2% for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP and as a result of the hyperinflationary designation and devaluation of the local currency in Venezuela, the Company's results of operations in 2010 were adversely impacted. As a result, during 2011 and 2012, the Company used alternative foreign currency markets with less favorable exchange rates to access U.S. Dollars for Revlon Venezuela, which adversely impacted the Company's results of operations.On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of Bolivars relative to the U.S. Dollar, effective beginning February 13, 2013, changing the official rate to 6.30 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the “Official Rate”). The Venezuelan government also announced that the Sistema de Transacciones en Moneda Extranjera ("SITME") currency market, which the Company had been using through early February 2013, would be eliminated. During the second quarter of 2013, Revlon Venezuela received approval from the Venezuelan government to import certain products through Venezuela's foreign exchange commission, the Comisión de Administracion de Divisas (“CADIVI”), subject to certain restrictions. The Company began importing certain products in the third quarter of 2013 utilizing the CADIVI market at the Official Rate. The Company imported approximately $2 million of products using the CADIVI market in 2013. In addition, a new foreign currency exchange system, Sistema Complementario de Administración de Divisas (“SICAD”), was developed in Venezuela during 2013. The Company received approval to import certain products utilizing the SICAD market, however, the Company did not import any products through the SICAD market in 2013. In January 2014, the Venezuela government announced that CADIVI will be eliminated and be replaced by the National Center of Foreign Trade ("NCFT"), and indicated that the SICAD market will continue to be offered as an alternative exchange. Although it is unclear at this time when the changes announced in January 2014 will take effect, the Company will attempt to continue participating in exchanging Bolivars for U.S. Dollars to the extent permitted through the CADIVI, SICAD and/or NCFT markets to the extent reasonable for its business in the future. If the rate of exchange in any new currency market is higher than the Official Rate, it may have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations going forward.Volume restrictions on the conversion of the Bolivar to the U.S. Dollar limits Revlon Venezuela’s purchasing activity. Due to the current political and economic environment in Venezuela, there is also a risk that there could be a foreign currency devaluation which could cause the Company's cash and cash equivalents to decrease, and which could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2013, the impact to the Company of a 100% devaluation in the official exchange rate (to approximately 12.6 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar) would be a one-time foreign currency loss of approximately $0.5 million to reflect the re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet. Going forward, additional governmental restrictions, including further currency devaluations or continued worsening of import authorization controls, foreign exchange price controls or labor unrest in Venezuela, could have further adverse impacts on the Company’s business and results of operations.Additionally, while the Company is in the process of exiting its business operations in China, transfers of funds to the Company's subsidiary in China, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, are subject to registration with or approval by China’s governmental authorities, including the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or the relevant examination and approval authority. Also, Company loans to finance its China subsidiary cannot exceed certain statutory limits.19The Company's net sales outside of the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were approximately 44%, 43% and 44% of the Company's total consolidated net sales, respectively. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected and may continue to affect the Company's results of operations and the value of the Company's foreign assets in 2013 and 2014, respectively, which in turn may adversely affect the Company's reported net sales and earnings and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.Products Corporation enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain net cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are entered into primarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in foreign currencies and generally have maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2013, the notional amount of Products Corporation's foreign currency forward exchange contracts was $52.9 million. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts that Products Corporation enters into may not adequately protect against foreign currency fluctuations.Terrorist attacks, acts of war or military actions and/or other civil unrest may adversely affect the territories in which the Company operates and the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations. On September 11, 2001, the U.S. was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope. These attacks contributed to major instability in the U.S. and other financial markets and reduced consumer confidence. These terrorist attacks, as well as terrorist attacks such as those that have occurred in Benghazi, Libya, Madrid, Spain and London, England, attempted terrorist attacks, military responses to terrorist attacks, other military actions and/or civil unrest as recently occurring in the Ukraine and Venezuela, may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions, resulting in work stoppages, reduced consumer spending and/or reduced demand for the Company's products. These developments subject the Company's worldwide operations to increased risks and, depending on their magnitude, could reduce net sales and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The Company's products are subject to federal, state and international regulations that could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), in the U.S., as well as various other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities, including those in the European Union, or the EU, Canada and other countries in which the Company operates. The Company's Oxford, North Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida manufacturing facilities are registered with the FDA as drug manufacturing establishments, permitting the manufacture of cosmetics and other beauty-care products that contain over-the-counter drug ingredients, such as sunscreens and anti-perspirant deodorants in the case of the Oxford, North Carolina facility and anti-dandruff hair-care products in the case of the Jacksonville, Florida facility. Regulations in the U.S., the EU, Canada and other countries in which the Company operates that are designed to protect consumers or the environment have an increasing influence on the Company's product claims, ingredients and packaging. To the extent federal, state, local and/or foreign regulatory changes occur in the future, they could require the Company to reformulate or discontinue certain of its products or revise its product packaging or labeling, any of which could result in, among other things, increased costs to the Company, delays in product launches, product returns or recalls and lower net sales, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The failure of the Company's information technology systems and/or difficulties or delays in implementing new information technology systems could disrupt the Company's business operations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.The operation of the Company's business depends on the Company's information technology systems. The Company relies on its information technology systems to effectively manage, among other things, the Company's business data, communications, supply chain, inventory management, customer order entry and order fulfillment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, compliance with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and other processes and data necessary to manage the Company's business. The failure of the Company's information technology systems, including any failure of the Company's current systems and/or as a result of transitioning to additional or replacement information technology systems, as the case may be, to perform as the Company anticipates could disrupt the Company's business and could result in, among other things, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of data and the loss of sales and customers, which could cause the Company's business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, the Company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company's control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failure, system conversions, security breaches, cyber-attacks, viruses and/or human error. In any such event, the Company could be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace its information technology systems, and the Company could experience interruptions in its ability to service its customers. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.We are in the process of developing a plan to implement a company-wide SAP enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. Our anticipated SAP ERP system implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our 20operations. The system implementation subjects us to substantial costs, the majority of which are capital expenditures, and inherent risks associated with migrating from our legacy systems. These costs and risks could include, but are not limited to: •inability to fill customer orders accurately or on a timely basis, or at all; •inability to process payments to vendors accurately or in a timely manner;•disruption of our internal control structure; •inability to fulfill our SEC or other governmental reporting requirements in a timely or accurate manner;•inability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely or accurate manner; •increased demands on management and staff time to the detriment of other corporate initiatives; and •significant capital and operating expenditures. If we are unable to successfully plan, design or implement this new SAP ERP system, in whole or in part, or experience unanticipated difficulties or delays in doing so, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Shares of Revlon, Inc. Class A Common Stock and Products Corporation's capital stock are pledged to secure various of Revlon, Inc.'s and/or other of the Company's affiliates’ obligations and foreclosure upon these shares or dispositions of shares could result in the acceleration of debt under the Amended Credit Agreements, the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture and the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement and could have other consequences.All of Products Corporation's shares of common stock are pledged to secure Revlon, Inc.’s guarantee under the Amended Credit Agreements. MacAndrews & Forbes has advised the Company that it has pledged shares of Revlon, Inc.’s Class A Common Stock to secure certain obligations of MacAndrews & Forbes. Additional shares of Revlon, Inc. and shares of common stock of intermediate holding companies between Revlon, Inc. and MacAndrews & Forbes may from time to time be pledged to secure obligations of MacAndrews & Forbes. A default under any of these obligations that are secured by the pledged shares could cause a foreclosure with respect to such shares of Revlon, Inc.'s Class A Common Stock, Products Corporation's common stock or stock of intermediate holding companies between Revlon, Inc. and MacAndrews & Forbes.A foreclosure upon any such shares of common stock or dispositions of shares of Revlon, Inc.’s Class A Common Stock, Products Corporation's common stock or stock of intermediate holding companies between Revlon, Inc. and MacAndrews & Forbes which are beneficially owned by MacAndrews & Forbes could, in a sufficient amount, constitute a “change of control” under the Amended Credit Agreements, the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture and the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement. A change of control constitutes an event of default under the Amended Credit Agreements which would permit Products Corporation's lenders to accelerate amounts outstanding under such facilities. In addition, holders of the 5¾% Senior Notes may require Products Corporation to repurchase their respective 5¾% Senior Notes under those circumstances. Upon a change of control, Products Corporation would also be required, after fulfilling its repayment obligations under the 5¾% Senior Notes Indenture, to repay in full the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan.Products Corporation may not have sufficient funds at the time of any such change of control to repay in full the borrowings under the Amended Credit Facilities or to repurchase or redeem the 5¾% Senior Notes and/or repay the Non-Contributed Loan. (See “- The Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.”)MacAndrews & Forbes has the power to direct and control the Company's business.MacAndrews & Forbes is wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman. After giving effect to Revlon, Inc.’s mandatory redemption of its Series A Preferred Stock on October 8, 2013, as well as to MacAndrews & Forbes’ voluntary conversion on October 4, 2013 of all of its 3,125,000 shares of Revlon Class B Common Stock, which had 10 votes per share, on a one-for-one basis into 3,125,000 shares of Revlon Class A Common Stock, Mr. Perelman, through MacAndrews & Forbes, beneficially owned approximately 78% of Revlon’s outstanding Class A Common Stock on December 31, 2013. As a result, MacAndrews & Forbes is able to control the election of the entire Board of Directors of Revlon, Inc. and of Products Corporation's Board of Directors (as it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revlon, Inc.) and controls the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of Revlon, Inc.’s and Products Corporation's stockholders, including the approval of mergers, consolidations, sales of some, all or substantially all of the Company's assets, issuances of capital stock and similar transactions.21The Company may not be able to integrate Colomer into the Company’s ongoing business operations, which may result in the Company’s inability to fully realize the intended benefits of the Colomer Acquisition, or may disrupt the Company's current operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and/or results of operations.The Company plans to integrate the operations of Colomer into the Company’s business and expects to achieve approximately $30 million to $35 million of annualized cost reductions by the end of 2015, at a cost of approximately $45 million to $50 million in the aggregate over 2013 through 2015. The process of integrating Colomer into the Company's business involves complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges, which are time-consuming and expensive and may disrupt the Company's ongoing core business operations and involves a number of integration risks, including, but not limited to:•difficulties or complications in combining the companies' operations;•differences in controls, procedures and policies, regulatory standards and business cultures among the combined companies;•the diversion of management's attention from the Company's ongoing core business operations;•difficulties or delays in consolidating Colomer’s information technology platforms, including implementing systems designed to continue to ensure that the Company maintains effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the combined company and enable the Company to continue to comply with U.S. GAAP and applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations;•possible disruptions that could result from efforts to consolidate the combined Company’s manufacturing facilities or changes in the combined Company’s supply chain, including work stoppages;•unanticipated costs and other assumed contingent liabilities; and/or•possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company.These factors could cause the Company to not fully realize the anticipated financial and/or strategic benefits of the Colomer Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Item 1B.
