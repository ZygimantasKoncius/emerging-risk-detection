Item 1A. Risk Factors This report includes or incorporates forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties and fall within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by our use of the words believes, anticipates, plans, expects, may, will, would, should, intends, estimates, seeks and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. We cannot guarantee that we actually will achieve these plans, intentions or expectations. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included below important factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement we make. Our sole market is the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which causes a cyclical impact on our financial results. We sell capital equipment to companies that design, manufacture, assemble, and test semiconductor devices. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, causing a cyclical impact on our financial results. Industry order rates increased in fiscal 2010 and portions of fiscal 2011. However industry conditions weakened as we entered fiscal 2012. The timing and level of sustained industry recovery is uncertain at this time. The ability to forecast the business outlook for our industry is typically limited to three months. As a result, our expectations for our business for the full fiscal year ending July 31, 2013 (fiscal 2013) remain uncertain. Regardless of our outlook and forecasts, any failure to expand in cycle upturns to meet customer demand and delivery requirements or contract in cycle downturns at a pace consistent with the industry could have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant downturn in the markets for our customers semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and would negatively impact our business. Downturns in the semiconductor test equipment industry have been characterized by diminished product demand, excess production capacity, accelerated erosion of selling prices and excessive inventory levels. We believe the markets for newer generations of semiconductor devices will also experience similar characteristics. Our market is also characterized by rapid technological change and changes in customer demand. In the past, we have experienced delays in purchase commitments, delays in collecting accounts receivable and significant declines in demand for our products during these downturns, and we may not be able to maintain or exceed our current level of sales. Additionally, as a capital equipment provider, our revenue is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their businesses. Because a high portion of our costs are fixed, we are limited in our ability to reduce expenses and inventory purchases quickly in response to decreases in orders and revenues. In an economic contraction, we may not be able to reduce our significant fixed costs, such as continued investment in research and development and capital equipment requirements and materials purchases from our suppliers. The market for semiconductor test equipment is highly concentrated, and we have limited opportunities to sell our products. The semiconductor industry is highly concentrated, and a small number of semiconductor device manufacturers and contract assemblers account for a substantial portion of the purchases of semiconductor test equipment generally, including our test equipment. Our top customers in fiscal 2012 were Spirox and Texas Instruments which accounted for 22% and 21% of our net sales, respectively. In fiscal 2011, our top customers were Texas Instruments, Spirox, and Atmel, which accounted for 23%, 14%, and 13% of our net sales, respectively. Sales to the top ten customers were 68%, 80%, and 77%, of net sales in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Our customers may cancel orders with few or no penalties. If a major customer reduces orders for any reason, our revenues, operating results, and financial condition will be negatively affected. 8 Table of Contents Our ability to increase our sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from new customers. Semiconductor manufacturers typically select a particular vendors test system for testing its new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected a test system vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase test systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our revenue. Our sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period, including from one quarter to another, and they may continue to do so. Our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that have had and could continue to have material and adverse effects on our financial condition and stock price or lead to significant variability in our operating results or our stock price, including the following:  the fact that sales of a limited number of test systems may account for a substantial portion of our net sales in any particular fiscal quarter;  order cancellations by customers;  lower gross margins in any particular period due to changes in:  our product mix;  the configurations of test systems sold;  the customers to whom we sell our test systems; or  volume;  a long sales cycle due to the significant investment made by our customers in installing our test systems and the time required to incorporate our systems into our customers design or manufacturing process; and  changes in the timing of product orders due to:  unexpected delays in the introduction of products by our customers,  excess production capacity our customers,  shorter than expected lifecycles of our customers semiconductor devices,  uncertain market acceptance of products developed by our customers, or  our own research and development. We cannot predict the impact of these and other factors on our sales and operating results in any future period. Results of operations in any period, therefore, should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Because of this difficulty in predicting future performance, our operating results may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our failure to meet these expectations would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock. A substantial amount of the shipments of our test systems for a particular quarter may occur late in the quarter. Our shipment pattern may expose us to significant risks of not meeting our expected financial results for each quarter in the event of problems during the complex process of final integration, test and acceptance prior to shipment. If we were to experience problems of this type late in our quarter, shipments could be delayed and our operating results could fall below expectations. 9 Table of Contents Our dependence on subcontractors and sole source suppliers may prevent us from delivering an acceptable product on a timely basis. We rely on one subcontractor to manufacture our test systems and multiple other subcontractors for the manufacture of the components and subassemblies used to produce our test systems. Certain of the suppliers for certain components and subassemblies are sole source suppliers. We have no long term supply agreements with our contract manufacturers and purchase products through individual purchase orders. We may be required to qualify new or additional subcontractors and suppliers due to capacity constraints, competitive or quality concerns or other risks that may arise, including as a result of a change in control of, or deterioration in the financial condition of, a supplier or subcontractor. The process of qualifying subcontractors and suppliers is lengthy. Our reliance on subcontractors gives us less control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to significant risks, especially inadequate capacity, late delivery, substandard quality, and high costs. In addition, the manufacture of certain of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process. If a supplier became unable to provide parts in the volumes needed, at the required standards of quality or at an acceptable price, we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacement parts from alternative sources of supply, or manufacture such components or subassemblies internally. The failure to qualify acceptable replacement subcontractors or suppliers quickly would delay the manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could cause us to lose revenues and customers. We also may be unable to engage alternative sources for the production of our testing systems on a timely basis or upon terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are required for any reason to seek a new manufacturer of our test systems, an alternate manufacturer may not be available and, in any event, transitioning to a new manufacturer would require a significant lead time of nine months or more and would involve substantial expense and disruption of our business. Our test systems are highly sophisticated and complex capital equipment, with many custom components, and final assembly requires specific technical know-how and expertise. These factors could make it more difficult for us to find a new manufacturer of our test systems if our relationship with our outsource suppliers is terminated for any reason, which would cause us to lose revenues and customers. We are dependent on certain semiconductor device manufacturers as sole source suppliers of certain sub-assemblies and components used in our test systems which are manufactured in accordance with our proprietary design and specifications. We have no written supply agreement with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If one of our sole source suppliers were to fail to produce or provide the parts they agreed to build for us at the specifications, price or volume required, we would face a significant delay in the final production of our products because we do not have redundant capacity available and our revenue and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Compliance with current and future environmental regulations may be costly and disruptive to our operations. We may be subject to environmental and other regulations due to our production and marketing of products in certain states and countries that limit or restrict the amount of hazardous material in certain electronic components such as printed circuit boards. One such directive is Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. RoHS is short for restriction of hazardous substances. The RoHS Directive banned the placing on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), except where exemptions apply, from July 1, 2006. Manufacturers are required to ensure that their products, including their constituent materials and components, do not contain more than the minimum levels of the nine restricted materials in order to be allowed to export goods into the Single Market (i.e. of the European Communitys 27 Member States). Any interruption in supply due to the unavailability of restriction free products could have a significant impact on the manufacturing and delivery of our products. If a supplier became unable to provide parts in the volumes needed or at an acceptable price, we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements from alternative sources of supply or manufacture such components internally. 10 Table of Contents As previously discussed, the failure to qualify acceptable replacements quickly would delay the manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could cause us to lose revenues and customers. Future mergers and acquisitions may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention. We have in the past, and may in the future, seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses, products, technologies or engineers. For example, in August 2008 we completed our merger with Credence Systems Corporation and in June 2003, we completed our acquisition of StepTech, Inc. We may have to issue debt or equity securities to pay for future mergers or acquisitions, which could be dilutive to then current stockholders or subject us to the risk described below in We may need financing, which could be difficult to obtain. We have also incurred and may continue to incur certain liabilities or other expenses in connection with acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, and future mergers or acquisitions may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Our past and future mergers and acquisitions may involve many risks, including:  difficulties in managing our growth following mergers and acquisitions;  difficulties in the integration of the acquired personnel, operations, technologies, products and systems of the acquired companies;  uncertainties concerning the intellectual property rights we purport to acquire;  unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the mergers and acquisitions;  diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  adverse effects on our existing business relationships with our or our acquired companies customers;  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in-process research and development; and  inability to retain key employees of acquired companies. Any of the events described in the foregoing paragraphs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We may not be able to deliver custom hardware options and related applications to satisfy specific customer needs in a timely manner. The success of our business relies in substantial part on our ability to develop and deliver customized hardware and applications to meet our customers specific test requirements. Our test equipment may fail to meet our customers technical or cost requirements and may be replaced by competitive equipment or an alternative technology solution. Our inability to provide a test system that meets requested performance criteria when required by a device manufacturer would severely damage our reputation with that customer. This loss of reputation together with the risks discussed above under, The market for semiconductor test equipment is highly concentrated, and we have limited opportunities to sell our products may make it substantially more difficult for us to sell test systems to that manufacturer for a number of years. We have, in the past, experienced delays in introducing some of our products and enhancements. Our dependence on international sales and non-U.S. suppliers involves significant risk. International sales have constituted a significant portion of our revenues in recent years, and we expect that to continue. International sales accounted for 77% of our revenues for fiscal 2012 and 85% of our revenues for fiscal 2011. In addition, we rely on non-U.S. suppliers for several components of the equipment we sell. As a 11 Table of Contents result, a major part of our revenues and the ability to manufacture our products are subject to the risks associated with international commerce. These international relationships make us particularly sensitive to economic, political, regulatory and environmental changes in the countries from which we derive sales and obtain supplies. Our sole source final assembly manufacturing supplier in Malaysia increases our exposure to these types of international risks. International sales and our relationships with suppliers may be hurt by many factors, including:  changes in law or policy resulting in burdensome government controls, tariffs, restrictions, embargoes or export license requirements;  political and economic instability in our target international markets;  longer payment cycles common in foreign markets;  difficulties of staffing and managing our international operations;  less favorable foreign intellectual property laws making it harder to protect our technology from appropriation by competitors;  difficulties collecting our accounts receivable because of the distance and different laws;  the impact of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar laws; and  adverse weather and climate events. In the past, we have incurred expenses to meet new regulatory requirements in Europe, experienced periodic difficulties in obtaining timely payment from non-U.S. customers, and been affected by economic conditions in several Asian countries. Our foreign sales are typically invoiced and collected in U.S. dollars. A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies of those countries where we do business would increase the prices of our products as stated in those currencies and could hurt our sales in those countries. Significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could cause us to lower our prices and thus reduce our profitability. These fluctuations could also cause prospective customers to push out or delay orders because of the increased relative cost of our products. In the past, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the dollar and the currencies of countries in which we do business. From time to time we may enter into foreign currency hedging arrangements. Our market is highly competitive, and we have limited resources to compete. The semiconductor test equipment industry is highly competitive in all areas of the world. There are other domestic and foreign companies that participate in the markets for each of our products. Our main competitors in the industry are Advantest Corporation and Teradyne Inc. These competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer support capabilities than we have. We expect our competitors to enhance their current products and to introduce new products that may have comparable or better price and performance. The introduction of competing products could hurt sales of our current and future products. In addition, new competitors, including semiconductor manufacturers themselves, may offer new testing technologies, which may in turn reduce the value of our product lines. Increased competition could lead to intensified price-based competition, which would hurt our business and results of operations. Unless we are able to invest significant financial resources in developing products and maintaining customer support centers worldwide, we may not be able to compete effectively. We are exposed to the risks associated with the volatility of the U.S. and global economies. The lack of visibility regarding whether there will be sustained increases in business capital spending and growth periods for the sale of electronic goods and information technology equipment, and uncertainty regarding the amount of sales, underscores the need for caution in predicting growth in the semiconductor test equipment 12 Table of Contents industry in general and in our revenues and profits specifically. Slow or negative growth in the domestic economy may continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future. Our results of operations would be further adversely affected if we were to experience lower than anticipated order levels, cancellations of orders in backlog, extended customer delivery requirements or pricing pressure as a result of a slowdown. At lower levels of revenue, there is a higher likelihood that these types of changes in our customers requirements would adversely affect our results of operations because in any particular quarter a limited number of transactions accounts for an even greater portion of sales for the quarter. Development of our products requires significant lead-time, and we may fail to correctly anticipate the technical needs of our customers. Our test systems are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their new semiconductor devices. We therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers semiconductor devices, requiring us to make significant capital investments to develop new test equipment for our customers well before their devices are introduced. If our customers fail to introduce their devices in a timely manner or the market does not accept their devices, we may not recover our capital investment. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not generate revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction of products embodying new technologies or features by our competitors. Furthermore, if we were to make announcements of product delays, or if our competitors were to make announcements of new test systems, these announcements could cause our customers to defer or forego purchases of our test systems, which would also hurt our business. Our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel. Our success depends substantially upon the continued service of our executive officers and key personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment or non-competition agreement. Our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managers and technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for such specialized personnel is intense, and it may become more difficult for us to hire or retain them. Our volatile business cycles only aggravate this problem. Layoffs during an industry downturn could make it more difficult for us to hire or retain qualified personnel. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract additional skilled employees. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain intellectual property rights and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering our products and development and testing tools. To that end, we have obtained certain domestic and international patents and may continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate. We have also obtained certain trademark registrations. The process of seeking intellectual property protection can be time consuming and expensive. We cannot ensure that:  patents will issue from currently pending or future applications;  our existing patents or any new patents will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us;  foreign intellectual property laws will protect our intellectual property rights; or  others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our technology. 13 Table of Contents If we do not successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and confidentiality provisions in agreements with employees and consultants to protect our intellectual property. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to adequately enforce our rights against these people. Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could incur significant litigation costs and licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products. Intellectual property rights are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may be unknowingly infringing on the intellectual property rights of others and may be liable for that infringement, which could result in a significant liability for us. If we do infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we could be forced to either seek a license to intellectual property rights of others or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical. If we were to become involved in a dispute regarding intellectual property, whether ours or that of another company, we may have to participate in legal proceedings. These types of proceedings may be costly and time consuming for us, even if we eventually prevail. If we do not prevail, we might be forced to pay significant damages, obtain licenses, modify our products or processes, stop making products or stop using processes. We may need financing, which could be difficult to obtain. We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. In the event we need to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, if at all. Further, if we issue additional equity securities to obtain financing, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock and place restrictions on how we operate our business. If we incur substantial indebtedness in the future we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to our debt service obligations, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business and the industry in which we compete, make it more difficult for us to obtain any other necessary future financing and make us more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in our business. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, grow our business or respond to competitive pressures, which could seriously harm our business. Our stock price is volatile. In the twelve-month period ending on July 31, 2012, our stock price ranged from a low of $4.81 to a high of $7.78. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:  quarterly variations in operating results;  variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analysts estimates;  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;  announcements of technological innovations, new products, or strategic alliances; and  news reports relating to trends in our markets. 14 Table of Contents In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for semiconductor-related companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. We may record impairment charges which would adversely impact our results of operations. We review our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable, and we also review goodwill annually in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), Topic 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other. One potential indicator of goodwill impairment is whether our fair value, as measured by our market capitalization, has remained below our net book value for a significant period of time. Whether our market capitalization triggers an impairment charge in any future period will depend on the underlying reasons for the decline in stock price, the significance of the decline, and the length of time the stock price has been trading at such prices. In the event that we determine in a future period that impairment exists for any reason, we would record an impairment charge in the period such determination is made, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Internal control deficiencies or weaknesses that are not yet identified could emerge. Over time we may identify and correct deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal controls and, where and when appropriate, report on the identification and correction of these deficiencies or weaknesses. However, the internal control procedures can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that deficiencies or weaknesses are identified. Deficiencies or weaknesses that have not been identified by us could emerge and the identification and correction of these deficiencies or weaknesses could have a material impact on our results of operations. If our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate, we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.
