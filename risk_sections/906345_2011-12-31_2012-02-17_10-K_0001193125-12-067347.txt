Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, may also impair our business and operations. Risks Associated with Real Estate, Real Estate Capital, and Credit Markets Volatility in capital and credit markets, or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, could adversely impact us. The capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption, as particularly experienced in the latter half of 2008 through most of 2010, during which spreads on prospective debt financings fluctuated and made it more difficult to borrow money. In the event of renewed market disruption and volatility, we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all, which would adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to make distributions to shareholders, acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development pipeline. Other weakened economic conditions, including job losses and high unemployment rates, could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels. Unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results. Additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following:  local conditions, such as an oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent, or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area;  declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;  declines in market rental rates;  low mortgage interest rates and home pricing, making alternative housing more affordable;  government or builder incentives which enable home buyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive;  regional economic downturns which affect one or more of our geographical markets; and  increased operating costs, if these costs cannot be passed through to residents. 3 Table of Contents Short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents. Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of fifteen months or less. As these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. We face risks associated with land holdings and related activities. We hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings. The risks inherent in purchasing, owning, and developing land increase as demand for apartments, or rental rates, decrease. Real estate markets are highly uncertain and, as a result, the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate. In addition, carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability. As a result, we hold certain land, and may in the future acquire additional land, in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which precludes our developing a profitable multifamily community. If there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell, we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income. Difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility. We intend to continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets which may no longer meet our investment objectives. When we decide to sell an asset, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers in a timely manner as real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly, especially when market conditions are poor. These factors may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and may also limit our ability to utilize sales proceeds as a source of liquidity, which would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt. In addition, the provisions of the Code relating to REITs limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of property (unless we own the property through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale) if we have held the property less than two years, and this limitation may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to shareholders. We could be negatively impacted by the condition of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily real estate. We and other multifamily companies depend heavily on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. There have been discussions of reducing or eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a final decision by the government to eliminate Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or reduce their acquisitions or guarantees of apartment loans, may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, and the development of multifamily communities. Compliance or failure to comply with laws, including those requiring access to our properties by disabled persons, could result in substantial cost. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), and other federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, generally require public accommodations and apartment homes be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. These laws may require us to modify our existing properties. These laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features which increase our construction costs. Legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further costs and obligations or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons. We may incur unanticipated expenses which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations to comply with ADA, FHAA, and other federal, state, and local laws, or in connection with lawsuits brought by the government or private litigants. Competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income. There are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents. Our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located. This competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property, as well as on the rents realized. 4 Table of Contents Risks Associated with Our Operations Development and construction risks could impact our profitability. We intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio, and expect increased levels of development activity in 2012. Our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability, including the following:  inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required permits and authorizations;  increased materials and/or labor costs, problems with subcontractors, or other costs due to errors and omissions which occur in the design or construction process;  inability to obtain financing with favorable terms for the development of a community;  inability to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule;  the expected occupancy and rental rates may differ from the actual results; and  incurring costs related to the abandonment of development opportunities which we have pursued and subsequently deemed unfeasible. Our inability to successfully implement our development and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third-parties (including nonconsolidated subsidiaries). The terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project, and to assume the risk the time and costs associated with its performance may be greater than anticipated. As a result, profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors. The time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors, including those listed above, many of which are beyond this subsidiarys control. In addition, the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair, replace, or rebuild non-conforming work. Further, trailing liabilities, based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction, may result from such projects, and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statutes of repose in various jurisdictions. Our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected. We may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis. Our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks, including the following:  we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties into our existing operations;  our estimates of the costs, if any, of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate;  the expected occupancy and rental rates may differ from the actual results; and  we may not be able to obtain adequate financing. With respect to acquisitions of operating properties, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us and may not achieve expected returns or other benefits as a result of integration challenges, such as personnel and technology. 5 Table of Contents Competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. We expect other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private investors, and other multifamily REITs, will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties. This competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition. Losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage. We carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties, which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets by similar types of owners. We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future. However, some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes, or earthquakes, may be subject to coverage limitations. We exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits, and deductible provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. If we suffer a catastrophic loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. Investments through joint ventures involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor. We have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures. These investments involve risks, including the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours, possess the ability to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests, or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint ventures financial obligations. We and our joint venture partner may each have the right to initiate a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our joint venture partners interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate, finance, and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. We face risks associated with investments in and management of discretionary funds. We have formed the Funds which, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, we manage as the general partner and advisor. Each of the Funds has total capital commitments of $187.5 million or $375 million in the aggregate. We have committed to invest 20% of the total equity interest in each of the Funds, up to $75 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2011, one of the Funds was closed for future investments. We have contributed approximately $33.0 million to this Fund and it had a combined equity capital investment of $165.0 million at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, our capital contribution to the remaining open Fund was approximately $23.7 million and it had a combined equity capital investment of approximately $118.4 million. There are risks associated with the investment in and management of the Funds, including:  investors in the remaining open Fund may fail to make their capital contributions when due and, as a result, the Fund may be unable to execute its investment objectives;  the general partner of the Funds, our wholly-owned subsidiary, has unlimited liability for the third-party debts, obligations, and liabilities of the Funds pursuant to partnership law;  investors in the Funds (other than us), by majority vote, may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the Funds with or without cause and the Funds advisory boards, by a majority vote of their members, may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the Funds at any time for cause;  while we have broad discretion to manage the Funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the Funds, the investors or the advisory boards must approve certain matters, and as a result we may be unable to cause the Funds to make certain investments or implement certain decisions we consider beneficial; 6 Table of Contents  we are permitted to acquire land and develop communities outside of the remaining open Fund, but are generally prohibited from acquiring fully developed multifamily properties outside of this Fund until the earlier of (i) April 8, 2012, or (ii) such time as 90% of the remaining open Funds committed capital is invested, subject to certain exceptions;  our ability to dispose of all or a portion of our investments in the Funds is subject to significant restrictions; and  we may be liable if the Funds fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters. Tax matters, including failure to qualify as a REIT, could have adverse consequences. We may not continue to qualify as a REIT in the future. The Internal Revenue Service may challenge our qualification as a REIT for prior years and new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the federal tax consequences of such qualification. For any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions:  we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax;  we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify, thereby reducing our net income, including any distributions to shareholders, as we would be required to pay significant income taxes for the year or years involved; and  our ability to expand our business and raise capital would be impaired, which may adversely affect the value of our common shares. We may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow. These potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels. Any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders, perpetual preferred unit holders, and noncontrolling interest holders. We depend on our key personnel. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry, and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us. Changes in litigation risks could affect our business. As a large publicly-traded owner of multifamily properties, we may become involved in legal proceedings, including consumer, employment, tort, or commercial litigation, which if decided adversely to or settled by us, could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations. Risks Associated with Our Indebtedness and Financing Insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders. Substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities. As a result, our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents, which could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the following:  delay in resident lease commencements; 7 Table of Contents  decline in occupancy;  failure of residents to make rental payments when due;  the attractiveness of our properties to residents and potential residents;  our ability to adequately manage and maintain our communities;  competition from other available apartments and housing alternatives; and  changes in market rents. Cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing. In order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains. This requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt. We have significant debt, which could have important adverse consequences. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding debt of approximately $2.4 billion. This indebtedness could have important consequences, including:  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if we are unable to meet our mortgage obligations, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the mortgaged property;  our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions is increased; and  our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in business and industry conditions is limited. The mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt, our unsecured credit facility, and the indentures under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions, requirements, and other limitations, as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios. Maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility. A default in these provisions, if uncured, could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date, which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs. We may be unable to renew, repay, or refinance our outstanding debt. We are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed, repaid, or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt. Furthermore, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose on the property, appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases, or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value. Foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements of the Code. Variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. We have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes. In addition, we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates, which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders. 8 Table of Contents We may incur losses on interest rate hedging arrangements. Historically, we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with changes in interest rates, and we may continue to do so in the future. Although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates, they may also reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline. If a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness which is hedged, we may be exposed to losses to the extent which the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other. Additionally, nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks. Issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties, dividend payment rates to our shareholders, development and capital expenditures, costs of operations, and potential acquisitions. If our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated. If we issue more debt, we could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future. Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Moodys and Standard & Poors, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of Baa1 and BBB, respectively, with stable outlooks, on our senior unsecured debt. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Risks Associated with Our Shares Share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders. For us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals. As defined for federal income tax purposes, the term individuals includes a number of specified entities. To minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a REIT under this test, our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits. The ownership limits, as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities, may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control. These provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction. Our share price will fluctuate. The market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions, the risks discussed in this report and other matters, including the following:  operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;  investor interest in our property portfolio;  the reputation and performance of REITs;  the attractiveness of REITs as compared to other investment vehicles;  the results of our financial condition and operations; 9 Table of Contents  the perception of our growth and earnings potential;  dividend payment rates;  increases in market interest rates, which may lead purchasers of our common shares to demand a higher yield; and  changes in financial markets and national economic and general market conditions. The form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations. The form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Trust Managers and will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and other factors as the Board of Trust Managers may consider relevant. The Board of Trust Managers may modify the form, timing and/or amount of dividends from time to time. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Properties Our properties typically consist of mid-rise buildings or two and three story buildings in a landscaped setting and provide residents with a variety of amenities. Most of the properties have one or more swimming pools and a clubhouse and many have whirlpool spas, weight room facilities, and controlled-access gates. Many of the apartment homes offer additional amenities common to multifamily rental properties. Operating Properties (including properties held through unconsolidated joint ventures) The 196 operating properties in which we owned interests and operated at December 31, 2011 averaged 928 square feet of living area per apartment home. For the year ended December 31, 2011, no single operating property accounted for greater than 1.5% of our total revenues. Our operating properties had a weighted average occupancy rate of approximately 94.5% and 93.3% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and an average annual rental revenue per apartment home of $970 and $928 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Resident lease terms generally range from six to fifteen months. One hundred and seventy-one of our operating properties have over 200 apartment homes, with the largest having 904 apartment homes. Our operating properties have an average age of 12 years (calculated on the basis of investment dollars). Our operating properties were constructed and placed in service as follows: September 30, Year Placed in Service Number of Operating Properties 2006-2011 36 2001-2005 32 1996-2000 57 1991-1995 19 1986-1990 34 Prior to 1986 18 10 Table of Contents Property Table The following table sets forth information with respect to our 196 operating properties at December 31, 2011: September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, OPERATING PROPERTIES Property and Location Year PlacedIn Service Average ApartmentSize (Sq.

In March 2010, we announced the creation of an at-the-market (ATM) share offering program through which we could, but had no obligation to, sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $250 million (2010 ATM program), in amounts and at times as we determined, into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we issued approximately 4.9 million common shares at an average price of $48.37 per share for total net consideration of approximately $231.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we issued approximately 0.3 million common shares at an average price of $55.81 per share for total net consideration of approximately $13.8 million. The 2010 ATM program was terminated and no further common shares are available for sale under the 2010 ATM program. In May 2011, we created a second ATM share offering program through which we can sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $300 million (2011 ATM program) from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. We may, but have no obligation to, sell common shares through the 2011 ATM share offering program in amounts and at times as we determine. Actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, and determination of the appropriate sources of funding for us. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we issued approximately 1.5 million common shares at an average price of $62.98 per share for total net consideration of approximately $92.7 million. In January 2012, we issued approximately 0.1 million common shares at an average price of $62.41 per share for total net consideration of approximately $3.2 million. As of the date of this filing, we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $202.4 million remaining available for sale under the 2011 ATM program. In January 2012, we issued approximately 6.6 million common shares in a public equity offering and received approximately $391.6 million in net proceeds. We utilized these proceeds to fund the acquisition of the 80% interest not owned by us in twelve related joint ventures for approximately $99.5 million and the repayment of approximately $272.6 million in mortgage debt associated with these joint ventures. See Part III, Item 12, for a description of securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans. In January 2008, our Board of Trust Managers approved an increase of the April 2007 repurchase plan to allow for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common equity securities through open market purchases, block purchases, and privately negotiated transactions. Under this program, we have repurchased 4.3 million shares for a total of approximately $230.2 million from April 2007 through December 31, 2011. The remaining dollar value of our common equity securities authorized to be repurchased under the program was approximately $269.8 million as of December 31, 2011. There were no repurchases of our equity securities during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 17 Table of Contents Item 6.
