ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our three largest products, and our future success will depend on the continued acceptance of PROVIGIL and the growth of FENTORA. For the year ended December 31, 2007, 49% of our total consolidated net sales were derived from sales of PROVIGIL and 29% of our total consolidated net sales were derived from sales of our pain products, FENTORA and ACTIQ (including our generic OTFC product). Since September 2006, we have experienced meaningful erosion of branded ACTIQ sales in the United States and we expect this erosion will continue into 2008. In addition, sales of our own generic OTFC product could be significantly impacted by the entrance into the market of additional generic OTFC products, which could occur at any time. To counter this impact, we will need FENTORA, our next-generation pain product launched in October 2006, to achieve projected levels of growth. In September 2007, we issued a letter to healthcare professionals to clarify the appropriate patient selection, design and administration for FENTORA, following reports of serious adverse events in connection with the use of the product. With respect to PROVIGIL, we cannot be certain that it will continue to be accepted in its market. Specifically, the following factors, among others, could affect the level of market acceptance and/or growth of PROVIGIL and FENTORA: a change in the perception of the healthcare community of the safety and efficacy of the products, both in an absolute sense and relative to that of competing products; the level and effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and, with respect to PROVIGIL, those of our partner, Takeda; the extent to which the products are studied in clinical trials in the future and the results of any such studies; any unfavorable publicity regarding these or similar products; the price of the products relative to other competing drugs or treatments, including the impact of the availability of generic OTFC products on market acceptance of FENTORA; any changes in government and other third-party payer reimbursement policies and practices; and regulatory developments affecting the manufacture, marketing or use of these products, including, for example, the impact of any recent or future changes to the approved labels for these products. Any adverse developments with respect to the sale or use of PROVIGIL or FENTORA could significantly reduce our product revenues and have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate net income and positive net cash flow from operations. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for new products or for new formulations of our existing products, which would significantly hamper future sales and earnings growth. Our long-term prospects, particularly with respect to the growth of our future sales and earnings, depend to a large extent on our ability to obtain FDA approvals of new product candidates such as TREANDA or of expanded indications of our existing products such as FENTORA and NUVIGIL. There can be no assurance that our applications to market these and other product candidates will be 25 submitted or reviewed in a timely manner or that the FDA will approve the product candidates on the basis of the data contained in the applications. Even if approval is granted to market a product candidate, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize the product in the marketplace or achieve a profitable level of sales. We may not be able to maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property or market exclusivity for our key products and, therefore, competitors may develop competing products, which could result in a decrease in sales and market share, cause us to reduce prices to compete successfully and limit our commercial success. We place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection for new technologies, products and processes. To that end, we file applications for patents covering the compositions or uses of our drug candidates or our proprietary processes. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Accordingly, the patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technology. Patent disputes in our industry are frequent and can preclude commercialization of products. If we ultimately engage in and lose any such disputes, we could be subject to competition or significant liabilities, we could be required to enter into third party licenses or we could be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, even if such licenses are available, the terms of any license requested by a third party could be unacceptable to us. PROVIGIL / NUVIGIL The U.S. composition of matter patent for modafinil expired in 2001. We own U.S. and foreign patent rights that expire between 2014 and 2015 and cover pharmaceutical compositions and uses of modafinil, specifically, certain particle sizes of modafinil contained in the pharmaceutical composition of PROVIGIL. With respect to NUVIGIL, we successfully obtained issuance of a U.S. patent in November 2006 claiming the Form I polymorph of armodafinil, the active drug substance in NUVIGIL. This patent is currently set to expire in 2023. Foreign patent applications directed to the Form I polymorph of armodafinil and its use in treating sleep disorders are pending in Europe and elsewhere. Ultimately, these patents might be found invalid as the result of a challenge by a third party, or a potential competitor could develop a competing product or product formulation that avoids infringement of these patents. While we intend to vigorously defend the validity of these patents and prevent infringement, these efforts will be both expensive and time consuming and, ultimately, may not be successful. The loss of patent protection for our modafinil-based products would significantly and negatively impact future sales. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are aware of seven ANDAs on file with the FDA for pharmaceutical products containing modafinil. Each of these ANDAs contains a Paragraph IV certification in which the ANDA applicant certified that the U.S. particle-size modafinil patent covering PROVIGIL either is invalid or will not be infringed by the ANDA product. In March 2003, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against four companiesTeva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited and Barr Laboratories, Inc.based upon the ANDAs filed by each of these companies with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic form of modafinil. We believe that these four companies were the first to file ANDAs with Paragraph IV certifications and thus are eligible for the 180-day period of marketing exclusivity provided by the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. In early 2005, we also filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Carlsbad Technology, Inc. based upon the Paragraph IV ANDA related to modafinil that Carlsbad filed with the FDA. 26 In late 2005 and early 2006, we entered into settlement agreements with each of Teva, Mylan, Ranbaxy and Barr; in August 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with Carlsbad and its development partner, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which we understand has the right to commercialize the Carlsbad product if approved by the FDA. As part of these separate settlements, we agreed to grant to each of these parties a non-exclusive royalty-bearing license to market and sell a generic version of PROVIGIL in the United States, effective in April 2012, subject to applicable regulatory considerations. Under the agreements, the licenses could become effective prior to April 2012 only if a generic version of PROVIGIL is sold in the United States prior to this date. We filed each of the settlements with both the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ as required by the Medicare Modernization Act. The FTC conducted an investigation of each of the PROVIGIL settlements and, in February 2008, filed suit against us in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the validity of the settlements and related agreements entered into by us with each of Teva, Mylan, Ranbaxy and Barr. The complaint alleges a violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks to permanently enjoin us from maintaining or enforcing these agreements. We believe the FTC complaint is without merit. While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and the propriety of the settlement agreements, these efforts will be both expensive and time consuming and, ultimately, due to the nature of litigation, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. We also are aware of numerous private antitrust complaints filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, each naming Cephalon, Barr, Mylan, Teva and Ranbaxy as co-defendants and claiming, among other things, that the PROVIGIL settlements violate the antitrust laws of the United States and, in some cases, certain state laws. All but one of these actions have been consolidated into a complaint on behalf of a class of direct purchasers of PROVIGIL and a separate complaint on behalf of a class of consumers and other indirect purchasers of PROVIGIL. A separate complaint filed by an indirect purchaser of PROVIGIL was filed in September 2007. The plaintiffs in all of these actions are seeking monetary damages and/or equitable relief. We moved to dismiss the class action complaints in November 2006. Separately, in June 2006, Apotex, Inc., a subsequent ANDA filer seeking FDA approval of a generic form of modafinil, filed suit against us, also in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging similar violations of antitrust laws and state law. Apotex asserts that the PROVIGIL settlement agreements improperly prevent it from obtaining FDA approval of its ANDA, and seeks monetary and equitable remedies. Apotex also seeks a declaratory judgment that the '516 Patent is invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed by its proposed generic. In late 2006, we filed a motion to dismiss the Apotex case, which is pending. Separately, we are seeking a judicial order in Canada to prevent regulatory approval of Apotex's generic modafinil tablets in Canada. We expect a decision by the Federal Court of Canada in this matter in the third quarter of 2008. We believe that the private antitrust complaints described in the preceding paragraph and the Apotex antitrust complaint are without merit. While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and the propriety of the settlement agreements, these efforts will be both expensive and time consuming and, ultimately, due to the nature of litigation, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. In November 2005 and March 2006, we received notice that Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. and Apotex, Inc., respectively, also filed Paragraph IV ANDAs with the FDA in which each firm is seeking to market a generic form of PROVIGIL. We have not filed patent infringement lawsuits against either Caraco or Apotex as of the filing date of this report, although Apotex has filed suit against us, as described above. DURASOLV In the third quarter of 2007, the PTO notified us that, on re-examination, it has rejected the claims in the two U.S. patents for our DURASOLV ODT technology. We filed notices of appeal of the PTO's 27 decisions in the fourth quarter of 2007. While we intend to vigorously defend these patents, these efforts, ultimately, may not be successful. The invalidity of the DURASOLV patents could have a material adverse impact on revenues from our drug delivery business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancements to support our competitive position. Although we have entered into confidentiality and invention rights agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators, these parties could fail to honor such agreements or we could be unable to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, many of our scientific and management personnel have been recruited from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies where they were conducting research in areas similar to those that we now pursue. As a result, we could be subject to allegations of trade secret violations and other claims. Our activities and products are subject to significant government regulations and approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we fail to comply. We currently have a number of products that have been approved for sale in the United States, foreign countries or both. All of our approved products are subject to extensive continuing regulations relating to, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, and promotion. The failure to comply with any rules and regulations of the FDA or any foreign medical authority, or the post-approval discovery of previously unknown problems relating to our products, could result in, among other things: fines, recalls or seizures of products; total or partial suspension of manufacturing or commercial activities; non-approval of product license applications; restrictions on our ability to enter into strategic relationships; and criminal prosecution. Over the past few years, a significant number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities, including the DOJ and various U.S. Attorney's Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the FTC and various state Attorneys General offices. These investigations have alleged violations of various federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the False Claims Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with off-label promotion of products, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. Because of the broad scope and complexity of these laws and regulations, the high degree of prosecutorial resources and attention being devoted to the sales practices of pharmaceutical companies by law enforcement authorities, and the risk of potential exclusion from federal government reimbursement programs, numerous companies have determined that it is highly advisable that they enter into settlement agreements in these matters, particularly those brought by federal authorities. Companies that have chosen to settle these alleged violations have typically paid multi-million dollar fines to the government and agreed to abide by corporate integrity agreements. In early November 2007, we announced that we had reached an agreement in principle with the USAO in Philadelphia and the DOJ with respect to the USAO investigation that began in September 2004. The investigation was focused on our sales and promotional practices with respect to ACTIQ, GABITRIL and PROVIGIL. Under this agreement, we expect to pay $425.0 million as part of a comprehensive settlement of all Federal and related state Medicaid claims. In addition, we will agree to 28 a single federal misdemeanor violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The terms described above are subject to negotiation and the execution of the final settlement and corporate integrity agreements. There can be no assurance that the settlement will be finalized on the terms outlined above. In September 2004, we announced that we had received a voluntary request for information from the Office of the Connecticut Attorney General that also appears to be focused on our sales and promotional practices with respect to ACTIQ, GABITRIL and PROVIGIL. We are cooperating with this Office, are providing documents and other information in response to these and additional requests and are engaged in ongoing discussions with them. In late October 2007, we also received a civil demand for information from the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General that is focused on sales and promotional practices with respect to ACTIQ, FENTORA and certain of our other products. We intend to cooperate with this request. Both of these matters may involve civil penalties and/or fines. The payment of any settlement or judgment amount and/or fines could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Furthermore, it is reasonably likely that we will face future additional requests for information from other state attorneys general focused on historical sales and promotional practices for our U.S. products. If civil penalties and/or fines were to result from such investigations, it could materially and adversely effect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. In late 2007, we were served with a series of putative class action complaints filed on behalf of entities that claim to have purchased ACTIQ for use outside of the product's approved label. The complaints allege violations of various state consumer protection laws, as well as the violation of the common law of unjust enrichment, and seek an unspecified amount of money in actual, punitive and/or treble damages, with interest, and/or disgorgement of profits. We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these matters and in any similar actions that may be filed in the future. In March 2007, we received a letter requesting information related to ACTIQ and FENTORA from Congressman Henry A. Waxman in his capacity as Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The letter cites two articles concerning ACTIQ published in The Wall Street Journal in November 2006 and requests information concerning our sales and marketing practices for ACTIQ and FENTORA, among other things. We are cooperating with this request and are continuing to provide documents and other information to the Committee. It is both costly and time-consuming for us to comply with these inquiries and with the extensive regulations to which we are subject. Additionally, incidents of adverse drug reactions, unintended side effects or misuse relating to our products could result in additional regulatory controls or restrictions, or even lead to withdrawal of a product from the market. With respect to our product candidates, we conduct research, preclinical testing and clinical trials, each of which requires us to comply with extensive government regulations. We cannot market these product candidates or these new indications in the United States or other countries without receiving approval from the FDA or the appropriate foreign medical authority. The approval process is highly uncertain and requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Ultimately, we may never obtain approval in a timely manner, or at all. Without these required approvals, our ability to substantially grow revenues in the future could be adversely affected. In addition, because PROVIGIL, NUVIGIL, FENTORA, ACTIQ and generic OTFC contain active ingredients that are controlled substances, we are subject to regulation by the DEA and analogous foreign organizations relating to the manufacture, shipment, sale and use of the applicable products. These regulations also are imposed on prescribing physicians and other third parties, making the storage, transport and use of such products relatively complicated and expensive. With the 29 increased concern for safety by the FDA and the DEA with respect to products containing controlled substances and the heightened level of media attention given to this issue, it is possible that these regulatory agencies could impose additional restrictions on marketing or even withdraw regulatory approval for such products. In addition, adverse publicity may bring about a rejection of the product by the medical community. If the DEA, FDA or analogous foreign authorities withdrew the approval of, or placed additional significant restrictions on the marketing of any of our products, our ability to promote our products and product sales could be substantially affected. We rely on third parties for the timely supply of specified raw materials, equipment, contract manufacturing, formulation or packaging services, product distribution services, customer service activities and product returns processing. Although we actively manage these third party relationships to ensure continuity and quality, some events beyond our control could result in the complete or partial failure of these goods and services. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations. Manufacturing, supply and distribution problems may create supply disruptions that could result in a reduction of product sales revenue and an increase in costs of sales, and damage commercial prospects for our products. The manufacture, supply and distribution of pharmaceutical products, both inside and outside the United States, is highly regulated and complex. We, and the third parties we rely upon for the manufacturing and distribution of our products, must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA and foreign authorities, including current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. We also must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the DEA and analogous foreign authorities for certain of our products that contain controlled substances. The DEA also has authority to grant or deny requests for quota of controlled substances such as the fentanyl citrate that is the active ingredient in ACTIQ and generic OTFC. Under our license and supply agreement with Barr, we are obligated to sell generic OTFC to Barr for its resale in the United States. While we currently have available fentanyl quota to produce ACTIQ and generic OTFC, in the future we could face shortages of quota that could negatively impact our ability to supply product to Barr or to produce ACTIQ or our generic OTFC product. If we are unable to provide product to Barr, it is possible that either Barr or the FTC could claim that such a failure would constitute a breach of our agreements with these parties. The facilities used to manufacture, store and distribute our products also are subject to inspection by regulatory authorities at any time to determine compliance with regulations. These regulations are complex, and any failure to comply with them could lead to remedial action, civil and criminal penalties and delays in production or distribution of material. For certain of our products in the United States and abroad, we depend upon single sources for the manufacture of both the active drug substances contained in our products and for finished commercial supplies. The process of changing or adding a manufacturer or changing a formulation requires prior FDA and/or analogous foreign medical authority approval and is very time-consuming. If we are unable to manage this process effectively or if an unforeseen event occurs at any facility, we could face supply disruptions that would result in significant costs and delays, undermine goodwill established with physicians and patients, damage commercial prospects for our products and adversely affect operating results. 30 As our products are used commercially, unintended side effects, adverse reactions or incidents of misuse may occur that could result in additional regulatory controls, changes to product labeling, adverse publicity and reduced sales of our products. During research and development, the use of pharmaceutical products, such as ours, is limited principally to clinical trial patients under controlled conditions and under the care of expert physicians. The widespread commercial use of our products could identify undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in our clinical trials or the commercial use as of the filing date of this report. For example, in September 2007, we issued a letter to healthcare professionals to clarify the appropriate patient selection, design and administration for FENTORA, following reports of serious adverse events in connection with the use of the product. Likewise, in February 2005, working with the FDA, we updated our prescribing information for GABITRIL to include a bolded warning describing the risk of new onset seizures in patients without epilepsy. In addition, in patients who take multiple medications, drug interactions could occur that can be difficult to predict. Additionally, incidents of product misuse, product diversion or theft may occur, particularly with respect to products such as FENTORA, ACTIQ, generic OTFC and PROVIGIL, which contain controlled substances. These events, among others, could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products or lead to additional regulatory controls that could limit the circumstances under which the product is prescribed or even lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market. In particular, FENTORA and ACTIQ have been approved under regulations concerning drugs with certain safety profiles, under which the FDA has established special restrictions to ensure safe use. Any violation of these special restrictions could lead to the imposition of further restrictions or withdrawal of the product from the market. We face significant product liability risks, which may have a negative effect on our financial performance. The administration of drugs to humans, whether in clinical trials or commercially, can result in product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually at fault for causing an injury. Furthermore, our products may cause, or may appear to have caused, adverse side effects (including death) or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug has been administered to patients for some time. As our products are used more widely and in patients with varying medical conditions, the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction, unintended side effect or incidence of misuse may increase. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us, which could have a negative effect on our financial performance. The cost of product liability insurance has increased in recent years, and the availability of coverage has decreased. Nevertheless, we maintain product liability insurance in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable but which would be unlikely to cover the potential liability associated with a significant unforeseen safety issue. Any claims could easily exceed our current coverage limits. Even if a product liability claim is not successful, the adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may interfere with our business. Our product sales and related financial results will fluctuate, and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall, especially if investors do not anticipate them. A number of analysts and investors who follow our stock have developed models to attempt to forecast future product sales and expenses, and have established earnings expectations based upon those models. These models, in turn, are based in part on estimates of projected revenue and earnings that we disclose publicly. Forecasting future revenues is difficult, especially when we only have a few years of commercial history and when the level of market acceptance of our products is changing rapidly. As a result, it is reasonably likely that our product sales will fluctuate to an extent that may not 31 meet with market expectations and that also may adversely affect our stock price. There are a number of other factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate unexpectedly, including: cost of product sales; achievement and timing of research and development milestones; collaboration revenues; cost and timing of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product launches; marketing and other expenses; manufacturing or supply disruptions; and costs associated with the operations of recently-acquired businesses and technologies. We may be unable to repay our substantial indebtedness and other obligations. All of our convertible notes outstanding contain restricted conversion prices that are either below or close to our stock price as of December 31, 2007. As a result, our convertible notes have been classified as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007. Under the terms of the indentures governing the notes, we are obligated to repay in cash the aggregate principal balance of any such notes presented for conversion. As of the filing date of this report, we do not have available cash, cash equivalents and investments sufficient to repay all of the convertible notes, if presented. In addition, there are no restrictions on our use of this cash and the cash available to repay indebtedness may decline over time. If we do not have sufficient funds available to repay the principal balance of notes presented for conversion, we will be required to raise additional funds. Because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable, we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations, thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities. Our research and development and marketing efforts are often dependent on corporate collaborators and other third parties who may not devote sufficient time, resources and attention to our programs, which may limit our efforts to develop and market potential products. To maximize our growth opportunities, we have entered into a number of collaboration agreements with third parties. For example, in the United States, we have an agreement with Takeda under which it will co-promote PROVIGIL until mid-2009. If Takeda fails to meet its obligations under the co-promotion agreement, is ineffective in its efforts, or if we or they determine to terminate the agreement prior to the end of its term, the growth of PROVIGIL sales could be impacted. In certain countries outside the United States, we have entered into agreements with a number of partners with respect to the development, manufacturing and marketing of our products. In some cases, our collaboration agreements call for our partners to control: the supply of bulk or formulated drugs for use in clinical trials or for commercial use; the design and execution of clinical studies; the process of obtaining regulatory approval to market the product; and/or marketing and selling of an approved product. In each of these areas, our partners may not support fully our research and commercial interests because our program may compete for time, attention and resources with the internal programs of our corporate collaborators. As such, our program may not move forward as effectively, or advance as rapidly, as it might if we had retained complete control of all research, development, regulatory and commercialization decisions. We also rely on some of these collaborators and other third parties for the 32 production of compounds and the manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical products. Additionally, we may find it necessary from time to time to seek new or additional partners to assist us in commercializing our products, though we ultimately might not be successful in establishing any such new or additional relationships. The efforts of government entities and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care may adversely affect our sales and limit the commercial success of our products. In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of pharmaceutical products is subject to various forms of direct and indirect governmental control, including the control over the amount of reimbursements provided to the patient who is prescribed specific pharmaceutical products. For example, we are aware of governmental efforts in France to limit or eliminate reimbursement for some of our products, particularly FONZYLANE, FONLIPOL and OLMIFON, which could impact revenues from our French operations. In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, various proposals to implement similar controls. The commercial success of our products could be limited if federal or state governments adopt any such proposals. In addition, in the United States and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. These third party payers are increasingly utilizing their significant purchasing power to challenge the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and seek to limit reimbursement levels offered to consumers for such products. Moreover, many governments and private insurance plans have instituted reimbursement schemes that favor the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for more expensive brand-name pharmaceuticals. In the United States in particular, generic substitution statutes have been enacted in virtually all states and permit or require the dispensing pharmacist to substitute a less expensive generic drug instead of an original branded drug. These third party payers are focusing their cost control efforts on our products, especially with respect to prices of and reimbursement levels for products prescribed outside their labeled indications. In these cases, their efforts may negatively impact our product sales and profitability. We experience intense competition in our fields of interest, which may adversely affect our business. Large and small companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for product development in competition with us. Products developed by any of these entities may compete directly with those we develop or sell. The conditions that our products treat, and some of the other disorders for which we are conducting additional studies, are currently treated with many drugs, several of which have been available for a number of years or are available in inexpensive generic forms. With respect to PROVIGIL, and, when launched, NUVIGIL, there are several other products used for the treatment of excessive sleepiness or narcolepsy in the United States, including methylphenidate products, and in our other territories, many of which have been available for a number of years and are available in inexpensive generic forms. With respect to AMRIX, we face significant competition from SKELAXIN®, FLEXERIL® and other inexpensive generic forms of muscle relaxants. With respect to FENTORA, we face competition from numerous short-and long-acting opioid products, including three productsJohnson & Johnson's DURAGESIC® and Purdue Pharmaceutical's OXYCONTIN® and MS-CONTIN®that dominate the market. In addition, we are aware of numerous other companies developing other technologies for rapidly delivering opioids to treat breakthrough pain that will compete against FENTORA in the market for breakthrough cancer pain in opioid-tolerant patients. It also is possible that the existence of generic OTFC could negatively impact the growth of FENTORA. With respect to ACTIQ, generic competition from Barr has meaningfully eroded branded ACTIQ sales 33 and impacted sales of our own generic OTFC through Watson. Our generic sales also could be significantly impacted by the entrance into the market of additional generic OTFC products, which could occur at any time. With respect to VIVITROL, we face competition from CAMPRAL® and oral naltrexone. With respect to TRISENOX, the pharmaceutical market for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory APL is served by a number of available therapeutics, such as VESANOID® by Roche in combination with chemotherapy. For all of our products, we need to demonstrate to physicians, patients and third party payers that the cost of our products is reasonable and appropriate in the light of their safety and efficacy, the price of competing products and the related health care benefits to the patient. Many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs and facilities than we have, and substantially greater experience in conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. These entities represent significant competition for us. In addition, competitors who are developing products for the treatment of neurological or oncological disorders might succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that we develop or sell or that would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Competition and innovation from these or other sources, including advances in current treatment methods, could potentially affect sales of our products negatively or make our products obsolete. Furthermore, we may be at a competitive marketing disadvantage against companies that have broader product lines and whose sales personnel are able to offer more complementary products than we can. Any failure to maintain our competitive position could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We plan to consider and, as appropriate, make acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses, which may subject us to a number of risks and/or result in us experiencing significant charges to earnings that may adversely affect our stock price, operating results and financial condition. As part of our efforts to acquire businesses or to enter into other significant transactions, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction. Despite our efforts, we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and, as a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of the acquisition. If we fail to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions we have consummated or may consummate in the future, whether as a result of unidentified risks, integration difficulties, regulatory setbacks or other events, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In connection with an acquisition, we must estimate the value of the transaction by making certain assumptions about, among other things, likelihood of regulatory approval for unapproved products and the market potential for marketed products and/or product candidates. Ultimately, our assumptions may prove to be incorrect, which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. In addition, we have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, significant charges to earnings related to our efforts to consummate acquisitions. For transactions that ultimately are not consummated, these charges may include fees and expenses for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisers in connection with our efforts. Even if our efforts are successful, we may incur as part of a transaction substantial charges for closure costs associated with the elimination of duplicate operations and facilities and acquired in-process research and development charges. In either case, the incurrence of these charges could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods. 34 We may be unable to successfully consolidate and integrate the operations of businesses we acquire, which may adversely affect our stock price, operating results and financial condition. We must consolidate and integrate the operations of acquired businesses with our business. Integration efforts often take a significant amount of time, place a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult and expensive than we predicted. The diversion of our management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with these recent acquisitions, and any future acquisitions we may consummate, could result in the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could negatively affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and others with whom we have business dealings. The results and timing of our research and development activities, including future clinical trials, are difficult to predict, subject to potential future setbacks and, ultimately, may not result in viable pharmaceutical products, which may adversely affect our business. In order to sustain our business, we focus substantial resources on the search for new pharmaceutical products. These activities include engaging in discovery research and process development, conducting preclinical and clinical studies and seeking regulatory approval in the United States and abroad. In all of these areas, we have relatively limited resources and compete against larger, multinational pharmaceutical companies. Moreover, even if we undertake these activities in an effective and efficient manner, regulatory approval for the sale of new pharmaceutical products remains highly uncertain because the majority of compounds discovered do not enter clinical studies and the majority of therapeutic candidates fail to show the human safety and efficacy necessary for regulatory approval and successful commercialization. In the pharmaceutical business, the research and development process generally takes 12 years or longer, from discovery to commercial product launch. During each stage of this process, there is a substantial risk of failure. Preclinical testing and clinical trials must demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and efficacious. The results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in subsequent clinical trials, and these clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy necessary to obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates. A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials. For ethical reasons, certain clinical trials are conducted with patients having the most advanced stages of disease and who have failed treatment with alternative therapies. During the course of treatment, these patients often die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agent being tested. Such events can have a negative impact on the statistical analysis of clinical trial results. The completion of clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed by many factors, including the rate of enrollment of patients. Neither we nor our collaborators can control the rate at which patients present themselves for enrollment, and the rate of patient enrollment may not be consistent with our expectations or sufficient to enable clinical trials of our product candidates to be completed in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we may not be permitted by regulatory authorities to undertake additional clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates. Even if such trials are conducted, our product candidates may not prove to be safe and efficacious or receive regulatory approvals. Any significant delays in, or termination of, clinical trials of our product candidates could impact our ability to generate product sales from these product candidates in the future. 35 The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices. The market price of our common stock is highly volatile, and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. For example, from January 1, 2007 through February 15, 2008 our common stock traded at a high price of $84.83 and a low price of $56.20. Negative announcements, including, among others: adverse regulatory decisions; disappointing clinical trial results; legal challenges, disputes and/or other adverse developments impacting our patents or other proprietary products; or sales or operating results that fall below the market's expectations could trigger significant declines in the price of our common stock. In addition, external events, such as news concerning economic conditions, our competitors or our customers, changes in government regulations impacting the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries or the movement of capital into or out of our industry, also are likely to affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be considered effective, which could result in possible regulatory sanctions and a decline in our stock price. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to furnish annually a report on our internal controls over financial reporting and to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order for management to evaluate our internal controls, we must regularly review and document our internal control processes and procedures and test such controls. Ultimately, we or our independent auditors could conclude that our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective if, among others things: any material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting exist; or we fail to remediate assessed deficiencies. During 2008, we are expanding our SAP® implementation to include additional capabilities. This expansion will require changes to certain aspects of our existing system of internal controls over financial reporting. Due to the number of controls to be examined, both with respect to this phase of the implementation and our other internal controls over financial reporting, the complexity of our processes, and the subjectivity involved in determining the effectiveness of controls, we cannot be certain that, in the future, all of our controls will continue to be considered effective by management or, if considered effective by our management, that our auditors will agree with such assessment. If, in the future, we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, either of which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities. A portion of our revenues and expenses is subject to exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business, which could adversely affect our reported results of operations. Historically, a portion of our revenues and expenses has been earned and incurred, respectively, in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2007, 19% of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We translate revenues earned and expenses incurred into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate applicable during the relevant period. A weakening of the U.S. dollar would, therefore, increase both our revenues and expenses. Fluctuations 36 in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the euro and other currencies may affect period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. Historically, we have not hedged our exposure to these fluctuations in exchange rates. Our customer base is highly concentrated. Our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors. These customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the United States. Three large wholesale distributors, Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, control a significant share of this network. These three wholesaler customers, in the aggregate, accounted for 66% of our total consolidated gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. Fluctuations in the buying patterns of these customers, which may result from seasonality, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors outside of our control, could significantly affect the level of our net sales on a period to period basis. Because of this, the amounts purchased by these customers during any quarterly or annual period may not correlate to the level of underlying demand evidenced by the number of prescriptions written for such products, as reported by IMS Health Incorporated. We are involved, or may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially impact our financial condition. As a biopharmaceutical company, we are or may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging employment discrimination, product liability, patent or other intellectual property rights infringement, patent invalidity or breach of commercial contract. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition. We currently are vigorously defending ourselves against those matters specifically described in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as numerous other litigation matters. While we currently do not believe that the settlement or adverse adjudication of these other litigation matters would materially impact our results of operations or financial condition, the final resolution of these matters and the impact, if any, on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows is unknown but could be material. Our dependence on key executives and scientists could impact the development and management of our business. We are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development and management of our business. Although we do not believe the loss of one individual would materially harm our business, our business might be harmed by the loss of the services of multiple existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner. Much of the know-how we have developed resides in our scientific and technical personnel and is not readily transferable to other personnel. While we have employment agreements with our key executives, we do not ordinarily enter into employment agreements with our other key scientific, technical and managerial employees. We do not maintain "key man" life insurance on any of our employees. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and our related compliance may limit any future profitability. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous, infectious and radioactive materials that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We store these materials, and various wastes resulting from their use, at our facilities pending ultimate use and 37 disposal. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes, and we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with related existing and future environmental laws and regulations. While we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, which could include fines and remedial costs. These damages could require payment by us of significant amounts over a number of years, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Anti-takeover provisions may delay or prevent changes in control of our management or deter a third party from acquiring us, limiting our stockholders' ability to profit from such a transaction. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value, of which 1,000,000 have been reserved for issuance in connection with our stockholder rights plan, and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our stockholder rights plan could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of Cephalon. Section 203, the rights plan, and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware corporate law, may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices.
