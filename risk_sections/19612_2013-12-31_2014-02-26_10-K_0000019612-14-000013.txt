Risk factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in Item 1A of this report. These and other factors are representative of the risk factors that may emerge and could cause a difference between an ultimate actual outcome and a preceding forward-looking statement.3PART I.Item 1. Business.General BusinessChemical Financial Corporation (Corporation), headquartered in Midland, Michigan, is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and incorporated in the State of Michigan. At December 31, 2013, the Corporation's consolidated total assets, loans, deposits and shareholders' equity were $6.18 billion, $4.65 billion, $5.12 billion and $697 million, respectively, and the Corporation employed approximately 1,700 full-time equivalent employees. For more information about the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations, see the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The Corporation was incorporated in August 1973. On June 30, 1974, the Corporation acquired Chemical Bank and Trust Company (CBT) pursuant to a reorganization in which the former shareholders of CBT became shareholders of the Corporation. CBT's name was changed to Chemical Bank on December 31, 2005. In addition to the acquisition of CBT, the Corporation has acquired 20 community banks and 36 other branch bank offices through December 31, 2013, including the acquisition of 21 branch bank offices during 2012 and the acquisition of O.A.K. Financial Corporation (OAK) during 2010. During the first quarter of 2013, six branch office locations were closed. The 2013, 2012, and 2010 transactions are discussed in more detail under the subheading "Acquisitions" included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Corporation has consolidated its acquisitions into a single commercial subsidiary bank, Chemical Bank. Chemical Bank operated through an internal organizational structure of four regional banking units and 17 community banking units as of December 31, 2013. Chemical Bank directly owns three operating non-bank subsidiaries: CFC Financial Services, Inc., CFC Title Services, Inc. and CFC Capital, Inc. CFC Financial Services, Inc. is an insurance subsidiary that operates under the assumed name of "Chemical Financial Advisors" and provides annuity products to customers. Chemical Financial Advisors also provides customers with access to mutual funds and marketable securities. CFC Title Services, Inc. is an issuer of title insurance to buyers and sellers of residential and commercial mortgage properties, including properties subject to loan refinancing. CFC Capital, Inc. primarily manages the Corporation's municipal investment securities portfolio.The Corporation's business is concentrated in a single industry segment - commercial banking. Chemical Bank offers a full range of traditional banking and fiduciary products and services. These include business and personal checking accounts, savings and individual retirement accounts, time deposit instruments, electronically accessed banking products, residential and commercial real estate financing, commercial lending, consumer financing, debit cards, safe deposit box services, money transfer services, automated teller machines, access to insurance and investment products, corporate and personal wealth management services and other banking services. The principal markets for the Corporation's products and services are the communities in Michigan where Chemical Bank's branches are located and the areas surrounding these communities. As of December 31, 2013, the Corporation and Chemical Bank served these markets through 156 banking offices located in 38 counties, all in the lower peninsula of Michigan. In addition to the banking offices, Chemical Bank operated two loan production offices and 173 automated teller machines, both on- and off-bank premises, as of December 31, 2013. The Corporation did not have banking offices or provide commercial banking services in the southeast portion of Michigan as of December 31, 2013. The southeast portion of Michigan is not part of the Corporation's current or projected markets for the delivery of its products and services.A summary of the composition of the Corporation's loan portfolio at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was as follows: December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Amount Percent of Total Amount Percent of Total Amount Percent of Total (Dollars in millions)Composition of Loans: Commercial$1,176.3 25% $1,002.7 24% $895.2 23%Commercial real estate1,232.7 27 1,161.9 28 1,072.0 28Real estate construction89.8 2 62.7 1 73.4 2Land development20.1 — 37.5 1 44.8 1Residential mortgage960.4 21 883.8 21 861.7 23Consumer installment644.8 14 546.0 13 484.0 13Home equity523.6 11 473.1 12 400.2 10Total composition of loans$4,647.7 100% $4,167.7 100% $3,831.3 100%4The Corporation's loan portfolio totaled $4.65 billion at December 31, 2013, compared to $4.17 billion and $3.83 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Corporation's loan portfolio increased $480 million, or 11.5%, during 2013, with commercial loans increasing $174 million, or 17.3%, commercial real estate loans increasing $71 million, or 6.1%, real estate construction increasing $27 million, or 43%, residential mortgage loans increasing $77 million, or 8.7%, consumer installment loans increasing $99 million, or 18.1%, and home equity loans increasing $51 million, or 10.7%, while land development loans decreased $17 million, or 47%. The Corporation's loan portfolio increased $336 million, or 8.8%, during 2012. The growth in loans during 2013 and 2012 was attributable to a combination of improving economic conditions in Michigan and the Corporation increasing its loan market share in its lending markets. The Corporation also acquired $44 million of loans in conjunction with its acquisition of 21 branch bank offices in 2012. The Corporation's loan portfolio is not concentrated in any one industry. The principal source of revenue for the Corporation is interest income and fees on loans, which accounted for 71% of total revenue in 2013 and 73% and 75% of total revenue in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Corporation has no foreign loans, assets or activities. No material part of the business of the Corporation or Chemical Bank is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. Interest income on investment securities, services charges and fees on deposit accounts and wealth management revenue are also significant sources of revenue. Interest income on investment securities accounted for 6% of total revenue in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Services charges and fees on deposit accounts accounted for 8% of total revenue in 2013 and 7% of total revenue in both 2012 and 2011. Wealth management revenue accounted for 5% of total revenue in 2013 and 4% of total revenue in 2012 and 2011. The Corporation offers services through the Wealth Management department of Chemical Bank. These services include trust, investment management and custodial services; financial and estate planning; and retirement and employee benefit programs. The Wealth Management department earns revenue from fees based on the market value of those assets under management, which can fluctuate as the market fluctuates. The Wealth Management department had assets under custodial and management arrangements of $2.51 billion, $2.07 billion and $1.95 billion as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Wealth Management department also sells investment products (largely annuity products and mutual funds) through its Chemical Financial Advisors program. Customer assets within the Chemical Financial Advisors program were $737 million, $669 million and $546 million as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.The nature of the business of Chemical Bank is such that it holds title to numerous parcels of real property. These properties are primarily owned for branch offices. However, the Corporation and Chemical Bank may hold properties for other business purposes, as well as on a temporary basis for properties taken in, or in lieu of, foreclosure to satisfy loans in default. Under current state and federal laws, present and past owners of real property may be exposed to liability for the cost of clean up of contamination on or originating from those properties, even if they are wholly innocent of the actions that caused the contamination. These liabilities could exceed the value of the contaminated property and could be material to the financial condition of the Corporation.Competition The business of banking is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition for financial services are price (interest rates paid on deposits, interest rates charged on loans and fees charged for services) and service (convenience and quality of services rendered to customers). In addition to competition from other commercial banks, banks face significant competition from non-bank financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies and investment firms. Credit unions and finance companies are particularly significant competitors in the consumer loan market. Banks also compete for deposits with a broad range of other types of investments, including mutual funds and annuities. In response to the competition for customers' bank deposits, Chemical Bank, through the Chemical Financial Advisors program, offers a broad array of mutual funds, annuity products, market securities and insurance products through an alliance with an independent, registered broker/dealer. In addition, the Wealth Management department of Chemical Bank offers customers a variety of investment products and services. Supervision and Regulation The Corporation and Chemical Bank are subject to extensive supervision and regulation under various federal and state laws. The supervisory and regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors. Banks are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations that have a material impact on their business. These include, among others, minimum capital requirements, state usury laws, state laws relating to fiduciaries, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Office of Foreign Assets Controls regulations, electronic funds transfer laws, redlining laws, predatory lending laws, antitrust laws, environmental laws, anti-money laundering laws and privacy laws. These laws and regulations can have a significant effect on the operating and financial results of banks. 5A summary of significant elements of some of the laws, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to the Corporation and Chemical Bank follows below. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. These statutes, regulations and policies are continually subject to review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Corporation and Chemical Bank could have a material effect on the business of the Corporation and Chemical Bank. Regulatory AgenciesThe Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from Chemical Bank. The Corporation is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) as a financial holding company and a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). The BHC Act provides for general regulation of financial holding companies by the FRB and functional regulation of banking activities by banking regulators. The Corporation is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Corporation's common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market® (NASDAQ) under the symbol CHFC and is subject to the NASDAQ Listing Rules. Chemical Bank is chartered by the State of Michigan and supervised, examined and regulated by the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS). Chemical Bank, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, is also supervised, examined and regulated by the FRB. Deposits of Chemical Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to the maximum extent provided by law. Bank Holding Company ActivitiesIn general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to the business of banking. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activities that are financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system without prior approval of the FRB. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. In order for the Corporation to maintain financial holding company status, both the Corporation and Chemical Bank must be categorized as "well-capitalized" and "well-managed" under applicable regulatory guidelines. If the Corporation or Chemical Bank ceases to meet these requirements, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements and place limitations on the Corporation's ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. In addition, if the deficiencies persist, the FRB may require the Corporation to divest of Chemical Bank. The Corporation and Chemical Bank were both categorized as "well-capitalized" and "well-managed" as of December 31, 2013.The BHC Act requires prior approval of the FRB for any direct or indirect acquisition of more than 5% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company by the Corporation. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the Corporation's performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA), the Corporation's adherence to banking regulations, and fair lending laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. Interstate Banking and BranchingBank holding companies may acquire banks located in any state in the United States without regard to geographic restrictions or reciprocity requirements imposed by state law. Banks may establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of other banks. The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is allowed only if specifically authorized by state law. Michigan permits both U.S. and non-U.S. banks to establish branch offices in Michigan. The Michigan Banking Code permits, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval of the DIFS, (1) acquisition of Michigan banks by FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states, (2) sale by a Michigan bank of branches to an FDIC-insured bank, savings bank or savings and loan association located in a state in which a Michigan bank could purchase branches of the purchasing entity, (3) consolidation of Michigan banks and FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states having laws permitting such consolidation, (4) establishment of branches in Michigan by FDIC-insured banks located in other states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories or protectorates having laws permitting a Michigan bank to establish a branch in such jurisdiction, and (5) establishment by foreign banks of branches located in Michigan. A Michigan bank holding company may acquire a non-Michigan bank and a non-Michigan bank holding company may acquire a Michigan bank. 6DividendsThe Corporation's primary source of funds is dividends paid to it by Chemical Bank. Federal and state banking laws and regulations limit both the extent to which Chemical Bank can lend or otherwise supply funds to the Corporation and also place certain restrictions on the amount of dividends Chemical Bank may pay to the Corporation. The Corporation and Chemical Bank are subject to regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums, which could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances where the payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Chemical Bank is required to obtain prior approval from the FRB for the declaration and payment of dividends to the Corporation if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year will exceed the total of (i) Chemical Bank's net income (as defined by regulation) for that year plus (ii) the retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the preceding two years. In addition, federal regulatory authorities have stated that, in the current financial and economic environment, banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Further, the FRB has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. Chemical Bank declared and paid dividends to the Corporation of $24.5 million and $27.6 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be paid or available to be paid in the future.Source of StrengthUnder FRB policy, the Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to Chemical Bank and to commit resources to support Chemical Bank. In addition, if DIFS deems Chemical Bank's capital to be impaired, DIFS may require Chemical Bank to restore its capital by a special assessment on the Corporation as Chemical Bank's only shareholder. If the Corporation failed to pay any assessment, the Corporation's directors would be required, under Michigan law, to sell the shares of Chemical Bank's stock owned by the Corporation to the highest bidder at either a public or private auction and use the proceeds of the sale to restore Chemical Bank's capital. Capital RequirementsThe Corporation and Chemical Bank are subject to regulatory "risk-based" capital guidelines. Failure to meet these capital guidelines could subject the Corporation or Chemical Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits, and other restrictions on its business. In addition, Chemical Bank would generally not receive regulatory approval of any application that requires the consideration of capital adequacy, such as a branch or merger application, unless it could demonstrate a reasonable plan to meet the capital requirement within a reasonable period of time. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) requires, among other things, federal banking agencies to take "prompt corrective action" in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA sets forth the following five capital categories: "well-capitalized," "adequately-capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly-undercapitalized" and "critically-undercapitalized." A depository institution's capital category will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures as established by regulation, which include Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratio measures and a leverage capital ratio measure. Federal banking regulators are required to take specified mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must generally appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution in any of the undercapitalized categories is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from paying any dividends, increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches, accepting or renewing any brokered deposits or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. Regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that, for a depository institution to be well capitalized, it must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive. For an institution to be adequately capitalized, it must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4% (and in some cases 3%). Under certain circumstances, the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. At December 31, 2013, the capital ratios of the Corporation and Chemical Bank exceeded the regulatory guidelines for institutions to be categorized as "well-capitalized." Additional information on the Corporation and Chemical Bank's capital ratios may be found under Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this report.7On July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (Reserve Board) approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS) capital guidelines for U.S. banks (commonly known as Basel III). Under the final rules, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Corporation. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. On July 9, 2013, the FDIC also approved, as an interim final rule, the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banks, following the actions of the Reserve Board. The FDIC's rule is identical in substance to the final rules issued by the Reserve Board. The phase-in period for the final rules will begin for the Corporation and Chemical Bank on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. Management is currently evaluating the provisions of the final rules and their expected impact on the Corporation and Chemical Bank and anticipates that the capital ratios for the Corporation and Chemical Bank under Basel III will continue to exceed the well capitalized minimum capital requirements. FDIC InsuranceThe FDIC formed the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (Reform Act). The FDIC implemented the Reform Act to create a stronger and more stable insurance system. The FDIC maintains the insurance reserves of the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The DIF insures deposit accounts of Chemical Bank up to a maximum amount per separately insured depositor. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. FDIC insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance premiums based on the risk an institution poses to the DIF. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in February 2011, the FDIC finalized rules, effective for assessments occurring after April 1, 2011, which redefine an institution's assessment base as average consolidated total assets minus average Tier 1 capital. The new rules also establish the general assessment rate for Risk Category 1 institutions, such as Chemical Bank, at 5 to 9 basis points (annualized). Prior to this, an institution's assessment base was average deposits and the assessment rate for Risk Category 1 institutions ranged from 12 to 16 basis points (annualized). The Corporation's FDIC DIF insurance premiums were $4.4 million in 2013, compared to $4.3 million in 2012 and $5.4 million in 2011.Safety and Soundness StandardsAs required by FDICIA, the federal banking agencies' prompt corrective action powers impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. These actions can include: requiring an insured depository institution to adopt a capital restoration plan guaranteed by the institution's parent company; placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities, including restrictions on transactions with affiliates; restricting the interest rates the institution may pay on deposits; prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; prohibiting the holding company from making capital distributions without prior regulatory approval; and, ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. The federal banking agencies also have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation and benefits. The federal regulatory agencies may take action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards. Depositor PreferenceThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the "liquidation or other resolution" of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC on behalf of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.8Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)Banks are subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of "outstanding," "satisfactory," "needs to improve," or "substantial non-compliance." The regulatory agency's assessment of the bank's record is made available to the public. Further, such assessment is required of any bank that has applied to: (1) obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution, (2) establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, (3) relocate an office, or (4) merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company, the FRB will assess the CRA compliance record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company, and such compliance records may be the basis for denying the application. Chemical Bank's CRA rating was "outstanding" as of December 31, 2013.Financial PrivacyFederal banking regulations limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot ActA major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued, and in some cases proposed, a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Office of Foreign Assets Control RegulationThe United States Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions on "U.S. persons" engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. The Dodd-Frank ActThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, established the new federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. The CFPB has issued significant new regulations that impact consumer mortgage lending and servicing. Those regulations became effective in January 2014. In addition, the CFPB has issued regulations that will change the disclosure requirements and forms used under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Compliance with these new laws and regulations and other regulations under consideration by the CFPB will likely result in additional costs and could change the products and/or services that are currently being offered, which could be significant and could adversely impact the Corporation's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 9Incentive CompensationThe regulatory agencies have issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. The FRB reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Corporation, that are not "large, complex banking organizations." The findings will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization's supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization's ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. Mergers, Acquisitions, Consolidations and Divestitures The Corporation's strategy for growth includes strengthening its presence in core markets, expanding into contiguous markets and broadening its product offerings, while taking into account the integration and other risks of growth. The Corporation evaluates strategic acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities in connection with possible transactions. As a result, discussions, and in some cases, negotiations may take place and future acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. These generally involve payment of a premium over book value and current market price, and therefore, dilution of book value per share will likely occur with any future transaction. On December 7, 2012, Chemical Bank acquired 21 branches from Independent Bank, a subsidiary of Independent Bank Corporation (Ticker: IBCP). In addition to the branch offices, which are located in the Northeast and Battle Creek regions of Michigan, the acquisition included $404 million in deposits and $44 million in loans. The purchase price of the branch offices, including equipment, was $8.1 million and the Corporation paid a premium on deposits of $11.5 million, or approximately 2.85% of total deposits. The loans were purchased at a discount of 1.75%.On April 30, 2010, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding stock of O.A.K. Financial Corporation (OAK) for total consideration of $83.7 million. OAK, a bank holding company, owned Byron Bank, which provided traditional banking services and products through 14 banking offices serving communities in Ottawa, Allegan and Kent counties in west Michigan. At April 30, 2010, OAK had total assets of $820 million, including total loans of $627 million, and total deposits of $693 million, including brokered deposits of $193 million. The Corporation operated Byron Bank as a separate subsidiary from the acquisition date until July 23, 2010, the date Byron Bank was consolidated with and into Chemical Bank. In connection with the acquisition of OAK, the Corporation recorded $43.5 million of goodwill, which was primarily attributable to the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Corporation and OAK. In addition, the Corporation recorded $9.8 million of other intangible assets in conjunction with the acquisition.There were no other business combinations, consolidations or divestitures completed by the Corporation during the three years ended December 31, 2013. However, during the three years ended December 31, 2013, the Corporation opened one branch office and closed eight branch offices. Each branch closure resulted in the transfer of customer accounts to a nearby branch of Chemical Bank.

Risk Factors.The Corporation's business model is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Although the Corporation seeks ways to manage these risks and develop programs to control those risks that management can, the Corporation ultimately cannot predict the future or control all of the risks to which it is subject. Actual results may differ materially from management's expectations. Some of these significant risks and uncertainties are discussed below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Corporation faces. Additional risks and uncertainties of which the Corporation is unaware, or that it currently deems immaterial, also may become important factors that adversely affect the Corporation and its business. If any of these risks were to occur, the Corporation's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of the Corporation's common stock per share could decline significantly. Investments in the Corporation's common stock involve risk. The market price of the Corporation's common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including, among other things: •Variations in quarterly or annual results of operations •Changes in dividends paid per share •Deterioration in asset quality, including declining real estate values •Changes in interest rates •Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by, or involving, the Corporation or its competitors •Failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions •Regulatory actions, including changes to regulatory capital levels, the components of regulatory capital and how regulatory capital is calculated•New regulations that limit or significantly change the Corporation's ability to continue to offer existing banking products•Volatility of stock market prices and volumes •Issuance of additional shares of common stock or other debt or equity securities of the Corporation •Changes in market valuations of similar companies •Uncertainties and fluctuations in the financial markets •Changes in securities analysts' estimates of financial performance or recommendations •New litigation or contingencies or changes in existing litigation or contingencies •New technology used, or services offered, by competitors •Breaches in information security systems of the Corporation and/or its customers and competitors•Changes in accounting policies or procedures required by standard setting or other regulatory agencies •New developments in the financial services industry •News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry •Perceptions in the marketplace regarding the financial services industry, the Corporation and/or its competitors •Rumors or erroneous information •Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts •Disruptions in the credit and financial markets, either nationally or globally, including the impact of a downgrade of U.S. government obligations by one of the credit agencies and the adverse effects of the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe The Corporation is subject to lending risk. A significant source of risk for the Corporation arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Most loans originated by the Corporation are secured, but some loans are unsecured depending on the nature of the loan. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing repayment includes a wide variety of real and personal property that may be insufficient to cover the amounts owed. Collateral values are adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, terrorist activity, environmental contamination and other external events. The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to net income that represents management's estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance for loan losses reflects management's continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, the value of real estate, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Corporation to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Deterioration in economic conditions and declines in real estate values affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other 11factors, both within and outside of the Corporation's control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Corporation's allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Any significant increase in the allowance for loan losses would likely result in a significant decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. See the sections captioned "Allowance for Loan Losses" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 4 - Loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Corporation's process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.The Corporation may face increased pressure from purchasers of its residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans. The Corporation sells fixed rate long-term residential mortgage loans it originates in the secondary market. Purchasers of residential mortgage loans, such as government sponsored entities, are increasing their efforts to seek to require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold when losses are incurred on a loan previously sold due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchaser's purchase criteria. As a result, the Corporation may face increased pressure from purchasers of its residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans and it may face increasing expenses to defend against such claims. If the Corporation is required in the future to repurchase loans previously sold, reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold, or if it incurs increasing expenses to defend against such claims, the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected. The Corporation holds general obligation municipal bonds in its investment securities portfolio. If one or more issuers of these bonds were to become insolvent and default on its obligations under the bonds, it could have a negative effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. Municipal bonds held by the Corporation totaled $307 million at December 31, 2013, and were issued by many different municipalities with no significant concentration in any single municipality. The Corporation held no general debt obligations issued by the City of Detroit at December 31, 2013. There can be no assurance that the financial conditions of these municipalities will not be materially and adversely affected by future economic conditions. If one or more of the issuers of these bonds were to become insolvent and default on their obligations under the bonds, it could have a negative effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. General economic conditions, and in particular conditions in the State of Michigan, affect the Corporation's business. The Corporation is affected by general economic conditions in the United States, although most directly within Michigan. The Corporation's success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the State of Michigan and the specific local markets in which the Corporation operates. The economic conditions in these local markets have a significant impact on the demand for the Corporation's products and services as well as the ability of the Corporation's customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Corporation's deposit funding sources. Substantially all of the Corporation's loans are to individuals and businesses in Michigan. Consequently, any prolonged decline in Michigan's economy could have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. A significant decline or a prolonged period of the lack of improvement in general economic conditions could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. If the Corporation does not adjust to changes in the financial services industry, its financial performance may suffer. The Corporation's ability to maintain its financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will depend largely on its ability to continue to grow its loan portfolio and also, in part, on its ability to maintain and grow its core deposit customer base and expand its financial services to its existing and/or new customers. In addition to other banks, competitors include savings and loan associations, credit unions, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies. The increasingly competitive environment is, in part, a result of changes in the economic environment within the State of Michigan, regulation, and changes in technology and product delivery systems. New competitors may emerge to increase the degree of competition for the Corporation's customers and services. Financial services and products are also constantly changing. The Corporation's financial performance will also depend, in part, upon customer demand for its products and services and its ability to develop and offer competitive financial products and services. 12Consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions. Technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions without the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries in financial transactions, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits and lending opportunities. Changes in interest rates could reduce the Corporation's net income and cash flow. The Corporation's net income and cash flow depends, to a great extent, on the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Market interest rates are beyond the Corporation's control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and competition. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, the interest received on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any significant adverse effects of changes in interest rates on the Corporation's results of operations, or any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. See the sections captioned "Net Interest Income" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and "Market Risk" in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, located elsewhere in this report, for further discussion related to the Corporation's management of interest rate risk. The global market crisis has triggered a series of reductions in interest rates. During 2011, 2012 and 2013, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) kept the target federal funds rate between zero and 0.25%. The low interest rate environment has resulted in lower yields on interest-earning assets, which could have an adverse impact on the Corporation's revenue and results of operations.The Corporation may be required to pay additional deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC, which could negatively impact earnings.Depending upon the magnitude of future losses that the FDIC deposit insurance fund suffers, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional premium increases or assessments in order to replenish the fund. The FDIC may need to set a higher base rate schedule based on future financial institution failures and updated failure and loss projections. Potentially higher FDIC assessment rates than those currently projected or special assessments could have an adverse impact on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation is subject to liquidity risk in its operations, which could adversely affect its ability to fund various obligations. Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If the Corporation is unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then its business, financial condition and results of operations would be negatively effected. Evaluation of investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's net income, projected net income and financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. Estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and/or value of the underlying asset and also assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon the Corporation's quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Additionally, the Corporation's management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost or amortized cost; (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer 13is experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) the Corporation's intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value; (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. Impairments to the carrying value of the Corporation's investment securities may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts paid to acquire subsidiaries over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. The Corporation tests goodwill at least annually for impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the "reporting unit" to which the goodwill relates. Substantially all of the Corporation's goodwill at December 31, 2013 was recorded on the books of Chemical Bank. The fair value of Chemical Bank is impacted by the performance of its business and other factors. If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the Corporation must write-down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management's determination include the performance of the Corporation, including the ability to generate taxable net income. If, based on available information, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. As of December 31, 2013, the Corporation did not carry a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. Future facts and circumstances may require a valuation allowance. Charges to establish a valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. If the Corporation is required to establish a valuation allowance with respect to its mortgage servicing rights asset, it could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2013, the Corporation's mortgage servicing rights asset had a book value of $3.4 million and a fair value of approximately $6.9 million. It is possible that the Corporation may have to establish a valuation allowance with respect to its mortgage servicing rights asset in the future. If the Corporation is required in the future to establish a valuation allowance with respect to its mortgage servicing rights asset, the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. The Corporation may be a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation and Chemical Bank are regularly involved in a variety of litigation arising out of the normal course of business. The Corporation's insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation or cause the Corporation to incur unexpected expenses, which could be material in amount. Should the ultimate expenses, judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed the Corporation's insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Corporation may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all. Environmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses. In the course of its business, the Corporation may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans it has originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties. In this event, the Corporation might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at the Corporation's sole cost and expense. The cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. The Corporation may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on the Corporation's business, results of operations and financial condition. 14The Corporation depends upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers. In deciding whether to extend credit to customers, the Corporation relies on information provided to it by its customers, including financial statements and other financial information. The Corporation may also rely on representations of customers as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and on reports of independent auditors on financial statements. The Corporation's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent that the Corporation extends credit in reliance on financial statements that do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles or that are misleading or other information provided by customers that is false or misleading. The Corporation operates in a highly competitive industry and market area. The Corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks within the various markets where the Corporation operates, as well as internet banks. The Corporation also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. The Corporation competes with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making new loans. Technology has lowered barriers to entry into the market and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Corporation's competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures, such as credit unions that are not subject to federal income tax. Due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Corporation can. The Corporation's ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things: •The ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets •The ability to expand the Corporation's market position •The ability to keep up-to-date with technological advancements in both delivering new products and maintaining existing products, while continuing to control operating costs•The scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands •The rate at which the Corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors •Customer satisfaction with the Corporation's level of service •Industry and general economic trends Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Corporation's competitive position, which could adversely affect the Corporation's growth and profitability and have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. Legislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely impact the Corporation or the businesses in which it is engaged.The financial services industry is extensively regulated. The Corporation and Chemical Bank are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of their operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance fund, and not to benefit the Corporation's shareholders. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact the Corporation or its ability to increase the value of its business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan losses. Future regulatory changes or accounting pronouncements may increase the Corporation's regulatory capital requirements or adversely affect its regulatory capital levels. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Corporation or Chemical Bank could require the Corporation to devote significant time and resources to defending its business and may lead to penalties that materially affect the Corporation and its shareholders. 15The Corporation may face increased regulatory capital requirements in the future under BASEL III.On July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (Reserve Board) approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS) capital guidelines for U.S. banks (commonly known as Basel III). Under the final rules, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Corporation. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. On July 9, 2013, the FDIC also approved, as an interim final rule, the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banks, following the actions of the Reserve Board. The FDIC's rule is identical in substance to the final rules issued by the Reserve Board.The phase-in period for the final rules will begin for the Corporation and Chemical Bank on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. While management is currently evaluating the provisions of the final rules and their expected impact on the Corporation and Chemical Bank, and management anticipates that the capital ratios for the Corporation and Chemical Bank under Basel III will continue to exceed the well capitalized minimum capital requirements, there can be no assurance that such will be the case. If either the Corporation or Chemical Bank are unable to meet or exceed the applicable minimum capital requirements, they may become subject to supervisory actions ranging in severity from losing financial holding company status, to being precluded from making acquisitions, engaging in new activities or becoming subject to informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions.If the Corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations through organic growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired. The Corporation is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain specified levels of capital to support its operations. The Corporation may need to raise additional capital to support its continued growth. The Corporation's ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside the Corporation's control, and on its financial performance. The Corporation cannot assure that it will be able to raise additional capital in the future on terms acceptable to the Corporation. If the Corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations through organic growth and acquisitions could be materially limited. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a significant impact on the Corporation and results of its operations. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, established the new federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. The CFPB has issued significant new regulations that impact consumer mortgage lending and servicing. Those regulations became effective in January 2014. In addition, the CFPB has issued regulations that will change the disclosure requirements and forms used under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Compliance with these new laws and regulations and other regulations under consideration by the CFPB will likely result in additional costs and could change the products and/or services that are currently being offered, which could be significant and could adversely impact the Corporation's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporation. The Corporation's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Corporation has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to losses or defaults by the Corporation or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Corporation to credit risk in the event of default of the Corporation's counterparty or client. In addition, the Corporation's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral that it holds cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan. The Corporation can give no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. The Corporation's controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Management regularly reviews and updates the Corporation's internal controls and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. A significant failure or circumvention of the Corporation's controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, results of operations and financial condition. 16Potential acquisitions may disrupt the Corporation's business and dilute shareholder value. The Corporation seeks merger or acquisition partners, including FDIC assisted acquisitions, that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things: •The recording of assets and liabilities of the target company at fair value may materially dilute shareholder value at the transaction date and could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations •The time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger targets •Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company •The estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate•Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company •The time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion •The diversion of the Corporation's management's attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses •The introduction of new products and services into the Corporation's business •Potential disruption to the Corporation's business •The incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on the Corporation's results of operations •The possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company •Difficulty in estimating the value of the target company •Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company •Difficulty or unanticipated expense associated with converting the communication and information systems of the target company to those of the Corporation The transactions may be more expensive to complete and the anticipated benefits, including cost savings and strategic gains, may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events, including the economic and financial conditions within the State of Michigan. The Corporation regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, dilution of the Corporation's tangible book value, net income per common share and ownership interest may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm the Corporation's business. As part of its business, the Corporation collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential client and customer information on behalf of itself and other third parties. Despite the security measures the Corporation has in place for its facilities and systems, and the security measures of its third party service providers, the Corporation may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether by the Corporation or by its vendors, could severely damage the Corporation's reputation, expose it to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt the Corporation's operations and have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business. The Corporation's information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security. The Corporation relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business and deliver its products. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Corporation's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While the Corporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Corporation's information systems or its customers' information or computer systems would not damage the Corporation's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Corporation to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Corporation to civil litigation and financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.17Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Corporation's business. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Corporation's ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Corporation's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Corporation to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation may issue debt and equity securities that are senior to the Corporation's common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of the Corporation's common stock. In the future, the Corporation may increase its capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of the Corporation's liquidation, its lenders and holders of its debt securities and preferred stock would receive a distribution of the Corporation's available assets before distributions to the holders of the Corporation's common stock. The Corporation's decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings may depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control. The Corporation cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of its future offerings and debt financings. Future offerings could reduce the value of shares of the Corporation's common stock and dilute a shareholder's interest in the Corporation. The Corporation relies on dividends from Chemical Bank for most of its revenue. The Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from Chemical Bank. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from Chemical Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends on the Corporation's common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Chemical Bank may pay to the Corporation. In the event Chemical Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may not be able to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The earnings of Chemical Bank have been the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders. Over the long-term, cash dividends to shareholders are dependent upon earnings, as well as capital requirements, regulatory restraints and other factors affecting Chemical Bank.
