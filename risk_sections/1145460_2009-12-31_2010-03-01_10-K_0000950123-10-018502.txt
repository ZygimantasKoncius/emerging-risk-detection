ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks described below may materially impact your investment in our company or may in the future, and, in some cases already do, materially affect us and our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider these factors with respect to your investment in our securities. This section includes or refers to certain forward-looking statements; you should read the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward-looking statements beginning on pages 2 and 35 of this report. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets related to the current national and worldwide financial crisis, which may continue indefinitely or intensify, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers and suppliers. The recent disruptions in the capital and credit markets may continue indefinitely or intensify, and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers and suppliers. These disruptions could adversely affect our ability to draw on our bank revolving credit facility, which is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our businesses or conduct acquisitions or make other discretionary investments, as well as our ability to effectively hedge our currency exchange or interest rate risks. Such disruptions may also adversely impact the capital needs of our customers and suppliers, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our business has substantial indebtedness, which could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility to adjust to market conditions, place us at a competitive disadvantage and expose us to interest rate fluctuations. We currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2009, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $2.1 billion, which included approximately $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our senior secured credit facility, $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our junior secured credit facility, $100.0 million in indebtedness under our outstanding September 2009 senior notes, $150.0 million in indebtedness under our outstanding August 2009 senior notes, $400.0 million in indebtedness under our outstanding May 2009 senior subordinated notes, and $150.0 million in indebtedness under our outstanding May 2007 senior subordinated convertible notes. Our substantial indebtedness could affect our future operations in important ways. For example, it could:  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under our senior notes, our senior subordinated notes, our senior subordinated convertible notes, our secured credit facilities and our other debt-related instruments;  require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash available to finance our operations and service obligations, to delay or reduce capital expenditures or the introduction of new products and/or forego business opportunities, including acquisitions, research and development projects or product design enhancements;  limit our flexibility to adjust to market conditions, leaving us vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and less able to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;  impair our ability to obtain additional financing;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and 13 Table of Contents  expose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment with respect to our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. We expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from our operations and potentially from other debt or equity offerings. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and pressure from competitors. We cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our debt, seek additional equity capital or borrow more money. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. The agreements governing our indebtedness, including the credit agreements governing our secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes, our senior subordinated notes and our senior subordinated convertible notes, subject us to various restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, including, among other things, our ability to:  incur additional debt;  pay dividends or make distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock or subordinated debt;  acquire other businesses;  make investments;  make loans to or extend credit for the benefit of third parties or their subsidiaries;  prepay indebtedness;  enter into transactions with affiliates;  raise additional capital;  make capital or finance lease expenditures;  dispose of or encumber assets; and  consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. These restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests. Our secured credit facilities contain certain financial covenants that we may not satisfy, which, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of the amounts due under our secured credit facilities and the limitation of our ability to borrow additional funds in the future. The agreements governing our secured credit facilities subject us to various financial and other restrictive covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include covenants pertaining to maximum consolidated leverage ratios and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratios. If we violate any of these covenants, we may suffer a material adverse effect. Most notably, our outstanding debt under our secured credit facilities could become immediately due and payable, our lenders could proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness and our ability to borrow additional funds in the future may be limited. Alternatively, we could be forced to refinance or renegotiate the terms and conditions of our secured credit 14 Table of Contents facilities, including the interest rates, financial and restrictive covenants and security requirements of the secured credit facilities, on terms that may be significantly less favorable to us. A default under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in a default and acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements. The agreements governing our indebtedness, including the credit agreements governing our secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes, our senior subordinated notes and our senior subordinated convertible notes, contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement could result in a default and acceleration of our repayment obligations under other agreements. If a cross-default were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. Even if new financing were available, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or acceptable terms. If some or all of our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations upon a fundamental change or change of control, which could limit our opportunity to enter into a fundamental change or change of control transaction. Upon the occurrence of a change of control or a fundamental change, as defined in the indentures governing our senior notes, our senior subordinated notes and our senior subordinated convertible notes, holders of notes will have the right to require us to purchase all or any part of such holders notes at a price equal to either 100% (in the case of the senior subordinated convertible notes) or 101% (in the case of all other notes) of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The events that constitute a change of control under the indentures may also constitute a default under our secured credit facilities, which prohibit the purchase of the notes by us in the event of certain changes of control, unless and until our indebtedness under the secured credit facilities is repaid in full. There can be no assurance that either we or our guarantor subsidiaries would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy all of our or their obligations under the senior notes, the senior subordinated notes, the senior subordinated convertible notes, and the secured credit facilities in the event of such a change of control or fundamental change. Our failure to purchase notes as required under any of the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, our senior subordinated notes or our senior subordinated convertible notes would result in a default under that indenture and under our secured credit facilities and could have a material adverse consequence for us and our stakeholders. Our acquisitions may not be profitable, and the integration of these businesses may be costly and difficult and may cause disruption to our business. Since commencing activities in November 2001, we have acquired and integrated into our operations numerous businesses. Since the beginning of 2007, we have acquired and integrated, or are in the process of integrating, Free & Clear; Concateno; the ACON second territory business; Matria Healthcare, Inc., or Matria; BBI Holdings Plc, or BBI; Panbio Limited, or Panbio; ParadigmHealth; Redwood; Alere Medical, Inc., or Alere Medical; HemoSense, Inc., or HemoSense; Cholestech Corporation, or Cholestech; Biosite Incorporated, or Biosite; and Instant Technologies, Inc., or Instant. We have also made a number of smaller acquisitions. The ultimate success of all of these acquisitions depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating these businesses or assets into our existing businesses. However, the successful integration of independent businesses or assets is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The difficulties of integrating companies and acquired assets include, among others:  consolidating manufacturing, research and development operations and health management information technology platforms, where appropriate;  integrating newly acquired businesses or product lines into a uniform financial reporting system; 15 Table of Contents  coordinating sales, distribution and marketing functions and strategies, including the integration of our current health management products and services;  establishing or expanding manufacturing, sales, distribution and marketing functions in order to accommodate newly-acquired businesses or product lines or rationalizing these functions to take advantage of synergies;  preserving the important licensing, research and development, manufacturing and supply, distribution, marketing, customer and other relationships;  minimizing the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns; and  coordinating geographically separate organizations.  regulatory issues relating to the integration of acquisitions or of legacy entities. We may not accomplish the integration of our acquisitions smoothly or successfully. The diversion of the attention of our management from current operations to integration efforts and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from these acquisitions and adversely affect our other businesses. Additionally, the costs associated with the integration of our acquisitions may be substantial. To the extent that we incur integration costs that are not anticipated when we finance our acquisitions, these unexpected costs could adversely impact our liquidity or force us to borrow additional funds. Ultimately, the value of any business or asset that we have acquired may not be greater than or equal to the purchase price of that business or asset. If we choose to acquire or invest in new and complementary businesses, products or technologies rather than developing them internally, such acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and, depending on how we finance these acquisitions or investments, could result in the use of significant amounts of cash. Our success depends in part on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. Accordingly, from time to time, we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them internally. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:  the inability to complete the acquisition or investment;  disruption of our ongoing businesses and diversion of management attention;  difficulties in integrating the acquired entities, products or technologies;  difficulties in operating the acquired business profitably;  difficulties in transitioning key customer, distributor and supplier relationships;  difficulties in evaluating, integrating and retaining key management;  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no, or limited, prior experience; and  unanticipated costs. In addition, any future acquisitions or investments may result in:  issuances of dilutive equity securities, which may be sold at a discount to market price;  use of significant amounts of cash;  the incurrence of debt;  the assumption of significant liabilities, including litigation;  unfavorable financing terms;  large one-time expenses; and  the creation of intangible assets, including goodwill, the write-down of which may result in significant charges to earnings. 16 Table of Contents If we fail to complete strategic acquisitions or investments our ability to meet our goals may be compromised and our future business prospects may be limited. We may be unable to come to terms on, or complete, potential acquisitions or investments in businesses we believe to be of strategic importance. This may occur for many reasons, including but not limited to:  we may not be able to agree on terms and conditions which we believe are reasonable;  we may be out bid by another party or parties;  we may not be able to finance the purchase price;  we may not have enough available stock to use as consideration;  a competitor may come to an agreement to acquire a targeted business before we are able to; or  antitrust or other laws or regulations may prohibit the acquisition or prevent us from completing the acquisition or investment in a manner which we believe would benefit us. Our joint venture transaction with P&G may not realize all of its intended benefits. In connection with SPD, our 50/50 joint venture with P&G, we may experience among other problems:  difficulties in integrating our corporate culture and business objectives with that of P&G into the joint venture;  diversion of our managements time and attention from other business concerns;  difficulties in retaining key employees who are necessary to manage the joint venture; or  difficulties in working with an entity based in Switzerland and thus remote or inconvenient to our Waltham, Massachusetts headquarters. Moreover, because SPD is a 50/50 joint venture, we do not have complete control over its operations, including business decisions which may impact SPDs profitability. For any of these reasons, or as a result of other factors, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the joint venture and cash flow or profits derived from our ownership interest in SPD may be less than the cash flow or profits that could have been derived had we retained the transferred assets and continued to operate the consumer diagnostics business ourselves. P&G retains an option to require us to purchase P&Gs interest in SPD at fair market value during the 60-day period beginning on May 17, 2011. Moreover, certain subsidiaries of P&G have the right, at any time upon certain material breaches by us or our subsidiaries of our obligations under the joint venture documents, to acquire all of our interest in the joint venture at fair market value less damages. We may not be successful in conducting future joint venture transactions. In addition to SPD, our 50/50 joint venture with P&G, we may enter into additional joint venture transactions in the future. We may experience unanticipated difficulties in connection with those joint venture transactions. We cannot assure you that any such joint venture transaction will be profitable or that we will receive any of the intended benefits of such a transaction. If goodwill and/or other intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions of other businesses become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings. In connection with the accounting for our acquisitions we have recorded, or will record, a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations in future periods. 17 Table of Contents We may experience manufacturing problems or delays due to, among other reasons, our volume, specialized processes or our global operations, which could result in decreased revenue or increased costs. Many of our manufacturing processes are complex and involve sensitive scientific processes, including unique and often proprietary antibodies which cannot be replicated or acquired through alternative sources without undue delay or expense. In addition, our manufacturing processes often require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year. Also, our private label consumer diagnostics business relies on operational efficiency to mass produce products at low margins per unit. We also rely on numerous third parties to supply production materials and, in some cases, there may not be alternative sources immediately available. In recent years we have shifted production of several of our products to our manufacturing facilities in China and closed less efficient and more expensive facilities elsewhere. We expect to continue to shift production to China and other lower cost facilities as part of our continuing efforts to reduce costs, improve quality and more efficiently serve targeted markets. Moving the production of products is difficult and involves significant risk. Problems establishing relationships with local materials suppliers; acquiring or adapting the new facility and its equipment to the production of new products; hiring, training and retaining personnel; and establishing and maintaining compliance with governmental regulations and industry standards can cause delays and inefficiencies, which could have a material negative impact on our financial performance. We also currently rely on a number of significant third-party manufacturers to produce certain of our professional diagnostics products. Any event which negatively impacts our manufacturing facilities, our manufacturing systems or equipment, or our contract manufacturers or suppliers, including, among others, wars, terrorist activities, natural disasters and outbreaks of infectious disease, could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products. Our revenues from the affected products would decline or we could incur losses until such time as we or our contract manufacturers are able to restore our or their production processes or we are able to put in place alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers. Even though we carry business interruption insurance policies, we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies. We may experience difficulties that may delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products or services. We intend to continue to invest in product and technology development. The development of new or enhanced products or services is a complex and uncertain process. We may experience research and development, manufacturing, marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new products, services or enhancements. We cannot be certain that:  any of the products or services under development will prove to be effective in clinical trials;  any products or services under development will not infringe on intellectual property rights of others;  we will be able to obtain, in a timely manner or at all, regulatory approval to market any of our products or services that are in development or contemplated;  the products and services we develop can be manufactured or provided at acceptable cost and with appropriate quality; or  these products and services, if and when approved, can be successfully marketed. The factors listed above, as well as manufacturing or distribution problems, or other factors beyond our control, could delay new product or service launches. In addition, we cannot assure you that the market will accept these products and services. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our overall revenue will increase if and when new products or services are launched. 18 Table of Contents If the results of clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval to sell our products are not available when expected, or do not demonstrate the anticipated safety and effectiveness of those potential products, we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected. Before we can sell certain of our products, we must conduct clinical studies intended to demonstrate that our potential products are safe and effective and perform as expected. The results of these clinical studies are used as the basis to obtain regulatory approval from government authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Clinical studies are experiments conducted using potential products and human patients having the diseases or medical conditions that the product is trying to evaluate or diagnose. Conducting clinical studies is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. In some cases, we may spend several years completing certain studies. If we fail to adequately manage our clinical studies, those clinical studies and corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our potential product candidates altogether. Even if we successfully manage our clinical studies, we may not obtain favorable results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. If we are unable to market and sell our new products or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to obtain required clearances or approvals for the commercialization of our products in the United States, we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected. Our future performance depends on, among other matters, our estimates as to when and at what cost we will receive regulatory approval for new products. Regulatory approval can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, making the timing, cost and ability to obtain approvals difficult to predict. In addition, regulatory processes are subject to change, and new or changed regulations can result in increased costs and unanticipated delays. In the United States, clearance or approval to commercially distribute new medical devices is received from the FDA through clearance of a Premarket Notification, or 510(k), or through approval of a Premarket Approval, or PMA. To receive 510(k) clearance, a new product must be substantially equivalent to a medical device first marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 1976. The FDA may determine that a new product is not substantially equivalent to a device first marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 1976 or that additional information is needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made. A not substantially equivalent determination, or a request for additional information, could prevent or delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category. The 510(k) clearance and PMA review processes can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy. It generally takes from three to five months from submission to obtain 510(k) clearance, and from six to eighteen months from submission to obtain a PMA approval; however, it may take longer, and 510(k) clearance or PMA approval may never be obtained. Modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, require new 510(k) or PMA submissions. We have made modifications to some of our products since receipt of initial 510(k) clearance or PMA. With respect to several of these modifications, we filed new 510(k)s describing the modifications and received FDA 510(k) clearance. We have made other modifications to some of our products that we believe do not require the submission of new 510(k)s or PMAs. The FDA may not agree with any of our determinations not to submit a new 510(k) or PMA for any of these modifications made to our products. If the FDA requires us to submit a new 510(k) or PMA for any device modification, we may be prohibited from marketing the modified products until the new submission is cleared by the FDA. There is increased uncertainty due to the impending changes to the 510(k) and PMA process. These reforms may increase the time to receive clearance. The uncertainty of the requirements for approval may result in an increase in costs. 19 Table of Contents We are also subject to applicable regulatory approval requirements of the foreign countries in which we sell products, which are costly and may prevent or delay us from marketing our products in those countries. In addition to regulatory requirements in the United States, we are subject to the regulatory approval requirements for each foreign country to which we export our products. In the European Union, regulatory compliance requires affixing the CE mark to product labeling. Although our products are currently eligible for CE marking through self-certification, this process can be lengthy and expensive. In Canada, as another example, our products require approval by Health Canada prior to commercialization, along with International Standards Organization, or ISO, 13485/CMDCAS certification. It generally takes from three to six months from submission to obtain a Canadian Device License. Any changes in foreign approval requirements and processes may cause us to incur additional costs or lengthen review times of our products. We may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, and any failure to do so may cause us to incur additional costs or prevent us from marketing our products in foreign countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with ongoing regulations applicable to our businesses may result in significant costs or, in certain circumstances, the suspension or withdrawal of previously obtained clearances or approvals. Our businesses are extensively regulated by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping. For example, our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers and distributors are, or can be, subject to periodic regulatory inspections. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any product approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of those products. In addition, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. We are also subject to routine inspection by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with the Quality System Regulation and Medical Device Reporting requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, including but not limited to ISO requirements. CLIA extended federal oversight to many clinical laboratories, including certain of our drug testing laboratories in the United States, by requiring that they be certified to meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Certain of our drug testing laboratories perform drug testing on employees of federal government contractors and certain other entities and are therefore regulated by SAMHSA, which has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to be approved to perform drug testing on employees of federal government contractors and certain other entities. Certain portions of our health management business are subject to unique licensing or permit requirements. For example, we may be required to obtain certification to participate in governmental payment programs, such as state Medicaid programs, we may need an operating license in some states, and some states have established Certificate of Need programs regulating the expansion of healthcare operations. In addition, we believe certain of our health management services are educational in nature, do not constitute the practice of medicine or provision of healthcare, and thus do not require that we maintain federal or state licenses to provide such services. However, it is possible that federal or state laws regarding the provision of virtual or telephonic medicine could be revised or interpreted to include our services, or that other laws may be enacted which require licensure or otherwise relate to our health management services. In such event, we may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations. In addition, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as privacy, healthcare kickbacks and false claims, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products or injunctions against our distribution, termination of our service agreements by our customers, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 20 Table of Contents New federal or state laws may be enacted, or regulatory agencies may impose new or enhanced standards, that would increase our costs, as well as expose us to risks associated with non-compliance. In addition, the federal government recently enacted the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act of 2008, or GINA, and we may incur additional costs in assisting our customers with their efforts to comply with GINA while continuing to offer certain of our services. Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition. There are a number of initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services in the United States. These initiatives range from proposals to fundamentally change federal and state healthcare reimbursement programs, including providing comprehensive healthcare coverage to the public under governmental funded programs, to minor modifications to existing programs. In particular, federal legislation may reduce or significantly alter Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Legislative and regulatory bodies are likely to continue to pursue healthcare reform initiatives and may continue to reduce the funding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare Advantage, in an effort to reduce overall federal healthcare spending. Other proposals include additional taxes on the sale of medical devices to fund a portion of the reform proposals. Legislative proposals are also pending that would impose federal reporting requirements regarding payments or relationships between manufacturers of covered drugs, devices or biological or medical supplies and physicians, among others. The ultimate content or timing of any future healthcare reform legislation, and its impact on us, is impossible to predict. If significant reforms are made to the healthcare system in the United States, or in other jurisdictions, those reforms may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we deliver products with defects, our credibility may be harmed, market acceptance of our products may decrease and we may be exposed to liability in excess of our product liability insurance coverage. The manufacturing and marketing of professional and consumer diagnostics involve an inherent risk of product liability claims. For example, a defect in one of our diagnostic products may cause the product to report inaccurate information, such as a false positive result, a false negative result or an error message. In addition, our product development and production are extremely complex and could expose our products to defects. Any defects could harm our credibility and decrease market acceptance of our products. In addition, our marketing of monitoring services may cause us to be subjected to various product liability claims, including, among others, claims that inaccurate monitoring results lead to injury or death. Potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. In the event that we are held liable for a claim for which we are not indemnified, or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage, that claim could materially damage our business and financial condition. The effect of market saturation may negatively affect the sales of our products, including our Triage BNP tests. Our meter-based Triage BNP test, launched domestically in January 2001, was the first blood test available to aid in the detection of heart failure and benefited from a first-to-market position until the entry of direct competition in June 2003. As the acute care and initial diagnosis market segment for BNP testing in the U.S. hospital setting becomes saturated, unless we are able to successfully introduce new products into the market and achieve market acceptance of those products in a timely manner, we expect the growth rates of sales unit volume for our Triage BNP tests and average selling prices in 2010 and future periods to be lower than the growth rates and selling prices experienced over the past several years, which may adversely impact our product sales, gross margins and our overall financial results. In addition, as the market for BNP testing matures and more competitive products become available, the average sales price for the Triage BNP tests is likely to decline. 21 Table of Contents The health management business is a relatively new component of the overall healthcare industry. The health management services provided by our Alere health management business and our subsidiaries QAS and Tapestry, are relatively new components of the overall healthcare industry. Accordingly, our health management customers have not had significant experience in purchasing, evaluating or monitoring such services, which can result in a lengthy sales cycle. The success of our health management business depends on a number of factors. These factors include:  our ability to differentiate our health management services from those of our competitors;  the extent and timing of the acceptance of our services as a replacement for, or supplement to, traditional managed care offerings;  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing and engagement efforts with customers and their health plan participants;  our ability to sell and implement new and additional services beneficial to health plans and employers and their respective participants or employees;  our ability to achieve, measure and effectively communicate cost savings for health plans and employers through the use of our services; and  our ability to retain health plan and employee accounts as competition increases and as health plan customers may choose to provide health management services themselves. Since the health management business is continually evolving, we may not be able to anticipate and adapt to the developing market. Moreover, we cannot predict with certainty the future growth rate or the ultimate size of the market. Increasing health insurance premiums and co-pays may cause individuals to forgo health insurance and avoid medical attention, either of which may reduce demand for our products and services. Health insurance premiums and co-pays have generally increased in recent years. Increased premiums may cause individuals to forgo health insurance, as well as medical attention. This may reduce demand for our point-of-care diagnostic products and also reduce the number of lives managed by our health management programs. Increased co-pays may cause insured individuals to forgo medical attention thereby reducing demand for our professional diagnostic tests, as well as revenues under certain health management programs. Our health management business may be adversely affected by cost reduction pressures among our customers. Additionally, our customers continue to face cost reduction pressures that may cause them to curtail their use of, or reimbursement for, health management services, to negotiate reduced fees or other concessions or to delay payment. In addition, the loss of jobs due to the recent economic crisis may cause the number of lives we manage to decrease. These financial pressures could have an adverse impact on our business. Rising unemployment may negatively impact the collectability of uninsured accounts and patient due accounts and/or reduce total health plan populations. Certain of our health management contracts provide reimbursement to us based on total relevant populations managed by health plans. As unemployment rates rise, certain of our revenues may be reduced under these contracts as managed lives may decrease. One of the primary collection risks of our health management business accounts receivable relates to uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. As unemployment rates rise nationally, these uninsured and patient due accounts could make up a greater percentage of the health management business accounts receivable. Deterioration in the collectability of these accounts could 22 Table of Contents adversely affect the health management business collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations. If we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans, our revenues may be reduced. The ability of our health management business to obtain favorable contracts with health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and other managed care plans significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our health management business. The business future success will depend, in part, on its ability to retain and renew its managed care contracts and to enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us. If the health management business is unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans, our revenues may be reduced. A portion of our health management fees are contingent upon performance. Some of our existing health management agreements contain savings or other guarantees, which provide that our revenues, or a portion of them, are contingent upon projected cost savings or other quality performance measures related to our health management programs. There is no guarantee that we will accurately forecast cost savings and clinical outcome improvements under our health management agreements or meet the performance criteria necessary to recognize potential revenues under the agreements. Additionally, untimely, incomplete or inaccurate data from our customers, or flawed analysis of such data, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to recognize revenues. If our costs of providing health management services increase, we may not be able to pass these cost increases on to our customers. Many of our health management services are provided pursuant to long-term contracts that we may not be able to re-negotiate. If our costs increase, we may not be able to increase our prices, which would adversely affect results of operations. Accordingly, any increase in our costs could reduce our overall profit margin. Demands of non-governmental payers may adversely affect our growth in revenues. Our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with non-governmental payers, including managed care plans, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our health management business. These non-governmental payers increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures, and the trend toward consolidation among non-governmental payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Reductions in price increases or the amounts received from managed care, commercial insurance or other payers could have a material, adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of our health management business. Our data management and information technology systems are critical to maintaining and growing our business. Our businesses, and in particular our health management business, are dependent on the effective use of information technology and, consequently, technology failure or obsolescence may negatively impact our businesses. In addition, data acquisition, data quality control, data security and data analysis, which are a cornerstone of our health management programs, are intense and complex processes subject to error. Untimely, incomplete or inaccurate data, flawed analysis of such data or our inability to properly integrate, implement and update systems could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In particular, we are relying on our recently launched healthcare portal, Apollo, to provide the framework and supporting infrastructure for significantly enhanced future health management programs and to provide a competitive advantage. Apollo is a new and unproven system and may not provide these expected benefits or meet our needs or the needs of our customers or program participants. 23 Table of Contents Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks. We generate a significant percentage of our net revenue from outside the United States, and a significant number of our employees, including manufacturing, sales, support and research and development personnel, are located in foreign countries, including England, Scotland, Japan, China, Australia, Germany and Israel. Conducting business outside the United States subjects us to numerous risks, including:  increased costs or reduced revenue as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates;  decreased liquidity resulting from longer accounts receivable collection cycles typical of foreign countries;  lower productivity resulting from difficulties managing sales, support and research and development operations across many countries;  lost revenues resulting from difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;  lost revenues resulting from the imposition by foreign governments of trade protection measures;  higher cost of sales resulting from import or export licensing requirements;  lost revenues or other adverse effects as a result of economic or political instability in or affecting foreign countries in which we sell our products or operate; and  adverse effects resulting from changes in foreign regulatory or other laws affecting the sales of our products or our foreign operations. Because our business relies heavily on foreign operations and revenues, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our need to convert currencies may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our business relies heavily on our foreign operations. Three of our five largest manufacturing operations are conducted outside the United States in Hangzhou and Shanghai, China and Matsudo, Japan, and we also have manufacturing operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and Israel. We also have significant research and development operations in Jena, Germany and Stirling, Scotland, as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia and Israel. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 31% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside the United States. Because of our foreign operations and foreign sales, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposures are related to the operations of our European and Asia Pacific subsidiaries and our manufacturing facilities in China and Japan. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could result in increased costs or reduced revenue and could affect our actual cash flow. Intense competition could reduce our market share or limit our ability to increase market share, which could impair the sales of our products and harm our financial performance. The medical products industry is rapidly evolving, and developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace. Competition in this industry, which includes both our professional diagnostics and consumer diagnostics businesses, is intense and expected to increase as new products and technologies become available and new competitors enter the market. Our competitors in the United States and abroad are numerous and include, among others, diagnostic testing and medical products companies, universities and other research institutions. Our future success depends upon maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in our areas of focus. Our competitors may:  develop technologies and products that are more effective than our products or that render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive; 24 Table of Contents  obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would prevent us from developing potential products; or  obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of our products more rapidly or effectively than we do. Also, the possibility of patent disputes with competitors holding patent rights may limit or delay expansion possibilities for our diagnostic businesses and new product launches. In addition, many of our existing or potential competitors have or may have substantially greater research and development capabilities, clinical, manufacturing, regulatory and marketing experience and financial and managerial resources. We could suffer monetary damages, incur substantial costs or be prevented from using technologies important to our products as a result of a number of pending legal proceedings. We are involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our businesses, including those matters discussed in Item 3 entitled Legal Proceedings beginning on page 30. Because of the nature of our business, we may be subject at any particular time to commercial disputes, product liability claims, negligence claims or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business, including infringement, employment or investor matters, and we expect that this will continue to be the case in the future. Such lawsuits generally seek damages, sometimes in substantial amounts, for commercial or personal injuries allegedly suffered and can include claims for punitive or other special damages. An adverse ruling or rulings in one or more such lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our sales, operations or financial performance. In addition, we aggressively defend our patent and other intellectual property rights. This often involves bringing infringement or other commercial claims against third parties. These suits can be expensive and result in counterclaims challenging the validity of our patents and other rights. We cannot assure you that these lawsuits or any future lawsuits relating to our business will not have a material adverse effect on us. The rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate, which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete in the market. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop or acquire commercially valuable patent rights and to protect our intellectual property. Our patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The degree of present and future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain and may be impacted by intellectual property law or legislation. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following:  pending patent applications we have filed, or to which we have exclusive rights, may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;  claims of any patents which are issued may not provide meaningful protection;  our inability to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;  patents licensed or issued to us or our customers may not provide a competitive advantage;  other parties may challenge patents or patent applications licensed or issued to us or our customers;  patents issued to other companies may harm our ability to do business;  other companies may design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed; and  all patents have a limited life, meaning at some point valuable patents will expire and we may lose the competitive advantage which they provide. In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, these 25 Table of Contents measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products. If these measures do not protect our rights, third parties could use our technology and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced. In addition, employees, consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries. For a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection or prosecute potential infringements of our patents. Our trade secrets may also become known through other means not currently foreseen by us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors or customers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights, or design around our proprietary technologies. Claims by others that our products infringe on their proprietary rights could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services and could increase our costs. Substantial litigation over intellectual property rights exists in both the professional and consumer diagnostics industries. We expect that our products and services could be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims, as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products and technology in different industry segments overlaps. Third parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents which our products and services or technology may infringe. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us. Any litigation could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of managements time and resources. In addition, litigation in which we are accused of infringement may cause negative publicity, have an impact on prospective customers, cause product delays, require us to develop non-infringing technology, make substantial payments to third parties or enter into royalty or license agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may be forced to stop selling current products or abandon new products under development and we could be exposed to legal actions by our customers. We have initiated, and may need to further initiate, lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive and, if we lose, could cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights, which would reduce our ability to compete in the market. We rely on patents to protect a portion of our intellectual property and our competitive position. In order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Litigation may be necessary to:  assert claims of infringement;  enforce our patents;  protect our trade secrets or know-how; or  determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Currently, we have initiated a number of lawsuits against competitors whom we believe to be selling products that infringe our proprietary rights. These current lawsuits and any other lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent positions in our industry are generally uncertain. We may not prevail in any of these suits and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. During the course of these suits, there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors perceive any of these results to be negative, the trading price of the notes may decline. 26 Table of Contents Non-competition obligations and other restrictions will limit our ability to take full advantage of our management team, the technology we own or license and our research and development capabilities. Members of our management team have had significant experience in the diabetes field. In addition, technology we own or license may have potential applications to this field and our research and development capabilities could be applied to this field. However, in conjunction with our split-off from Inverness Medical Technology, Inc., or IMT, we agreed not to compete with IMT and Johnson & Johnson in the field of diabetes through 2011. In addition, our license agreement with IMT prevents us from using any of the licensed technology in the field of diabetes. As a result of these restrictions, we are limited in our ability to pursue opportunities in the field of diabetes at this time. Our operating results may fluctuate due to various factors and as a result period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful. Factors relating to our business make our future operating results uncertain and may cause them to fluctuate from period to period. Such factors include:  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors;  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products;  the extent to which our current and future products rely on rights belonging to third parties;  changes in manufacturing costs or other expenses;  competitive pricing pressures;  changes in healthcare reimbursement policies and amounts;  public health measures or changes in practices or conduct which may increase or decrease incidents of disease or the need for diagnostic testing  regulatory changes;  the gain or loss of significant distribution outlets or customers;  increased research and development expenses;  liabilities and costs associated with litigation;  length of sales cycle and implementation process for new health management customers;  the costs and timing of any future acquisitions;  general economic conditions; or  general stock market conditions or other economic or external factors. Because our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, it may be difficult for us or our investors to predict future performance by viewing historical operating results. Period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful due to our acquisitions. We have engaged in a number of acquisitions in recent years, which makes it difficult to analyze our results and to compare them from period to period. Significant acquisitions since 2007 include our acquisitions of Instant in March 2007, Biosite in June 2007, Cholestech in September 2007, Matria in May 2008 and the ACON second territory business in April 2009. Period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful due to these acquisitions and are not indications of our future performance. Any future acquisitions will also make our results difficult to compare from period to period in the future. 27 Table of Contents Future sales of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, or Series B Preferred Stock, or our senior subordinated convertible notes may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into common stock in certain circumstances. If the conditions to conversion were satisfied, then subject to adjustment, each of the approximately 2.0 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2009 could convert into 5.7703 shares of our common stock, or approximately 11.4 million shares of our common stock. Upon certain extraordinary transactions, depending on the market price of our common stock at that time, the conversion rate could increase such that significantly more shares of common stock could be issued. Our $150.0 million principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately $43.98 per share, or approximately 3.4 million shares. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by holders of our Series B Preferred Stock or our senior subordinated convertible notes and by other hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock. The holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive liquidation payments in preference to the holders of our common stock. The current outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock have an aggregate stated liquidation preference of approximately $793.7 million. Dividends accrue on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a rate of 3% per annum, and we have the option to pay these dividends in shares of common stock or additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock and in either case must satisfy the dividend obligation by issuing the requisite number of shares based upon market prices. Upon a liquidation of our company, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive a liquidation payment prior to the payment of any amount with respect to the shares of our common stock. The amount of this preferential liquidation payment is the aggregate stated liquidation preference, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. Because of the substantial liquidation preference to which the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled, the amount available to be distributed to the holders of our common stock upon a liquidation of our company could be substantially limited or reduced to zero. The terms of the Series B Preferred Stock may limit our ability to raise additional capital through subsequent issuances of preferred stock. For so long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we are not permitted, without the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding, to authorize or designate any class or series of capital stock having rights on liquidation or as to distributions (including dividends) senior to the Series B Preferred Stock. This restriction could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may limit the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which may not be in your best interests. There are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us, even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions include the following:  our certificate of incorporation provides for three classes of directors with the term of office of one class expiring each year, commonly referred to as a staggered board. By preventing stockholders from voting on the election of more than one class of directors at any annual meeting of stockholders, this 28 Table of Contents provision may have the effect of keeping the current members of our board of directors in control for a longer period of time than stockholders may desire;  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock issued, which would allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control;  our certificate of incorporation prohibits our stockholders from filling board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings or taking action by written consent;  our certificate of incorporation provides for the removal of a director only with cause and by the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% or more of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; and  our bylaws require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations. Additionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, in general, imposes restrictions upon acquirers of 15% or more of our stock. Finally, the board of directors may in the future adopt other protective measures, such as a stockholder rights plan, which could delay, deter or prevent a change of control. ITEM 1B.
