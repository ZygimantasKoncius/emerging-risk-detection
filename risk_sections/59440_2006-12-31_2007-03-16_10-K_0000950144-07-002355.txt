Risk Factors Our business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries. Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity of us or one or more of our subsidiaries, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports that we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. We and our subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness. We and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations. At December 31, 2006, we and our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness (including embedded derivative liability and beneficial conversion feature related to convertible notes) of $294 million. In addition, subject to the terms of any future agreements, we and our subsidiaries will be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. There is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt. If we cannot service our fixed charges, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are a holding company and depend on cash payments from our subsidiaries, which are subject to contractual and other restrictions, in order to service our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock. We are a holding company and have no operations of our own. We hold our interests in our various businesses through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, VGR Holding and New Valley. In addition to our own cash resources, our ability to pay interest on our convertible debentures and to pay dividends on our common stock depends on the ability of VGR Holding and New Valley to make cash available to us. VGR Holdings ability to pay dividends to us depends primarily on the ability of Liggett, its wholly-owned subsidiary, to generate cash and make it available to VGR Holding. Liggetts revolving credit agreement permits Liggett to pay cash dividends to VGR Holding only if Liggetts borrowing availability exceeds $5 million for the 30 days prior to payment of the dividend and immediately after giving effect to the dividend, and so long as no event of default has occurred under the agreement, including Liggetts compliance with the covenants in the credit facility, including maintaining minimum levels of EBITDA (as defined) if its borrowing availability is below $20 million and not exceeding maximum levels of capital expenditures (as defined). Our receipt of cash payments, as dividends or otherwise, from our subsidiaries is an important source of our liquidity and capital resources. If we do not have sufficient cash resources of our own and do not receive payments from our subsidiaries in an amount sufficient to repay our debts and to pay dividends on our common stock, we must obtain additional funds from other sources. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain additional funds at all or on terms acceptable to us. Our inability to service these obligations and to continue to pay dividends on our common stock would significantly harm us and the value of our common stock. Liggett faces intense competition in the domestic tobacco industry. Liggett is considerably smaller and has fewer resources than its major competitors and, as a result, has a more limited ability to respond to market developments. Management Science Associates data indicate that the three largest cigarette manufacturers controlled approximately 86.8% of the United States cigarette market during 2006. Philip Morris is the largest and most profitable manufacturer in the market, and its profits are derived principally from its sale of premium cigarettes. Philip Morris had approximately 62.5% of the premium segment and 49.2% of the total domestic market during 2006. During 2006, all of Liggetts sales were in the discount segment, and its share of the total domestic cigarette market was 2.4%. Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco (which is now part of Reynolds American), the two largest cigarette manufacturers, have 25 Table of Contents historically, because of their dominant market share, been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry. Market pressures have historically caused the other cigarette manufacturers to bring their prices into line with the levels established by these two major manufacturers. In July 2004, RJR Tobacco and Brown & Williamson, the second and third largest cigarette manufacturers, completed the combination of their United States tobacco businesses to create Reynolds American. This transaction has further consolidated the dominance of the domestic cigarette market by Philip Morris and Reynolds American, which had a combined market share of approximately 77.1% at December 31, 2006. This concentration of United States market share could make it more difficult for Liggett and Vector Tobacco to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition in the market, either of which could have a material adverse affect on their sales volume, operating income and cash flows, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. Liggetts business is highly dependent on the discount cigarette segment. Liggett depends more on sales in the discount cigarette segment of the market, relative to the full-price premium segment, than its major competitors. All of Liggetts unit volume in 2006 and 2005 was generated in the discount segment. The discount segment is highly competitive, with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price. While the three major manufacturers all compete with Liggett in the discount segment of the market, the strongest competition for market share has recently come from a group of small manufacturers and importers, most of which sell low quality, deep discount cigarettes. While Liggetts share of the discount market increased to 8.7% in 2006 from 7.5% in 2005 and 7.4% in 2004, Management Science Associates data indicate that the discount market share of these other smaller manufacturers and importers was approximately 36.3% in 2006, 38.0% in 2005 and 39.4% in 2004. If pricing in the discount market continues to be impacted by these smaller manufacturers and importers, margins in Liggetts only current market segment could be negatively affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. Liggetts market share is susceptible to decline. In years prior to 2000, Liggett suffered a substantial decline in unit sales and associated market share. Liggetts unit sales and market share increased during each of 2000, 2001 and 2002, and its market share increased in 2003 while its unit sales declined. In 2006, Liggetts unit sales and market share increased compared to 2005 after declines in 2005 and 2004 compared to the prior year. This earlier market share erosion resulted in part from Liggetts highly leveraged capital structure that existed until December 1998 and its limited ability to match other competitors wholesale and retail trade programs, obtain retail shelf space for its products and advertise its brands. The decline in recent years also resulted from adverse developments in the tobacco industry, intense competition and changes in consumer preferences. According to Management Science Associates data, Liggetts overall domestic market share during 2006 was 2.4% compared to 2.2% during 2005 and 2.3% during 2004. Liggetts share of the discount segment during 2006 was 8.7%, up from 7.5% in 2005 and 7.4% in 2004. If Liggetts market share declines, Liggetts sales volume, operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. The domestic cigarette industry has experienced declining unit sales in recent periods. Industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States have been generally declining for a number of years, with published industry sources estimating that domestic industry-wide shipments decreased by approximately 2.4% during 2006. According to Management Science Associates data, domestic industry-wide shipments decreased by 3.2% in 2005 compared to 2004. We believe that industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States will generally continue to decline as a result of numerous factors. These factors include health considerations, diminishing social acceptance of smoking, and a wide variety of federal, state and local laws limiting smoking in restaurants, bars and other public places, as well as federal and state excise tax increases and settlement-related expenses which have contributed to high cigarette price levels in recent years. If this decline in industry-wide shipments continues and Liggett is unable to capture market share from 26 Table of Contents its competitors, or if the industry as a whole is unable to offset the decline in unit sales with price increases, Liggetts sales volume, operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. Litigation will continue to harm the tobacco industry. The cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts. New cases continue to be commenced against Liggett and other cigarette manufacturers. As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately 135 individual suits (excluding approximately 975 individual smoker cases pending in West Virginia state court as a consolidated action; Liggett has been severed from the trial of the consolidated action), 11 purported class actions and nine governmental and other third-party payor health care reimbursement actions pending in the United States in which Liggett was a named defendant. It is likely that similar legal actions, proceedings and claims will continue to be filed against Liggett. Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars, are specifically pled in these cases, in addition to compensatory and other damages. It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases including the certification of additional class actions. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco-related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. A civil lawsuit was filed by the United States federal government seeking disgorgement of approximately $289 billion from various cigarette manufacturers, including Liggett. In August 2006, the trial court entered a Final Judgment and Remedial Order against each of the cigarette manufacturing defendants, except Liggett. The Final Judgment, among other things, ordered the following relief against the non-Liggett defendants: (i) the defendants are enjoined from committing any act of racketeering concerning the manufacturing, marketing, promotion, health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the United States; (ii) the defendants are enjoined from making any material false, misleading, or deceptive statement or representation concerning cigarettes that persuades people to purchase cigarettes; (iii) the defendants are permanently enjoined from utilizing lights, low tar, ultra lights, mild, or natural descriptors, or conveying any other express or implied health messages in connection with the marketing or sale of cigarettes as of January 1, 2007; (iv) the defendants must make corrective statements on their websites, and in television and print media advertisements; (v) the defendants must maintain internet document websites until 2016 with access to smoking and health related documents; (vi) the defendants must disclose all disaggregated marketing data to the government on a confidential basis; (vii) the defendants are not permitted to sell or otherwise transfer any of their cigarette brands, product formulas or businesses to any person or entity for domestic use without a court order, and unless the acquiring person or entity will be bound by the terms of the Final Judgment; and (viii) the defendants must pay the appropriate costs of the government in prosecuting the action, in an amount to be determined by the trial court. It is unclear what impact, if any, the Final Judgment will have on the cigarette industry as a whole. While Liggett was excluded from the Final Judgment, to the extent that it leads to a decline in industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States, Liggetts sales volume, operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. In one of the other cases pending against Liggett, in 2000, an action against cigarette manufacturers involving approximately 975 named individual plaintiffs was consolidated for trial on some common issues before a single West Virginia state court. Liggett is a defendant in most of the cases pending in West Virginia. In January 2002, the court severed Liggett from the trial of the consolidated action. Two purported class actions have been certified in state court in Kansas and New Mexico alleging antitrust violations. As new cases are commenced, the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase. Class action suits have been filed in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers, alleging, among other things, that the use of the terms light and ultralight constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices. One such suit (Schwab v. Philip Morris), pending in federal court in New York against the cigarette manufacturers, seeks to create a nationwide class of light cigarette smokers and includes Liggett as 27 Table of Contents a defendant. The action asserts claims under Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The proposed class is seeking as much as $200 billion in damages, which could be trebled under RICO. In November 2005, the court ruled that if the class is certified, the plaintiffs would be permitted to calculate damages on an aggregate basis and use fluid recovery theories to allocate them among class members. Fluid recovery would permit potential damages to be paid out in ways other than merely giving cash directly to plaintiffs, such as establishing a pool of money that could be used for public purposes. On September 25, 2006, the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. There are currently four individual tobacco-related actions pending where Liggett is the only tobacco company defendant. In April 2004, in one of these cases, a jury in a Florida state court action awarded compensatory damages of $540,000 against Liggett. In addition, plaintiffs counsel was awarded legal fees of $752,000. Liggett has appealed both the verdict and the award of legal fees. In March 2005, in another case in Florida state court in which Liggett is the only defendant, the court granted Liggetts motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff appealed and, in June 2006, a Florida intermediate appellate court reversed the trial courts decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. Trial has been scheduled in Missouri state court for May 2007 in another case. Individual tobacco-related cases may increase as a result of the Florida Supreme Courts ruling in Engle. In May 2003, a Florida intermediate appellate court overturned a $790 million punitive damages award against Liggett and decertified the Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. smoking and health class action. In July 2006, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part the May 2003 intermediate appellate court decision. Among other things, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the decision decertifying the class and the order vacating the punitive damages award, but preserved several of the trial courts Phase I findings (including that: (i) smoking causes lung cancer, among other diseases; (ii) nicotine in cigarettes is addictive; (iii) defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous; (iv) the defendants concealed material information; (v) the defendants agreed to misrepresent information relating to the health effects of cigarettes with the intention that the public would rely on this information to its detriment; (vi) all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective; and (vii) all defendants were negligent) and allowed plaintiffs to proceed to trial on individual liability issues (utilizing the above findings) and compensatory and punitive damage issues, provided they commence their individual lawsuits within one year of the date the courts decision became final on January 11, 2007. The motions for reconsideration and/or clarification of the decision were denied except that the Florida Supreme Court vacated the determination of a finding as to fraud, misrepresentation and conspiracy to misrepresent. The decision could result in the filing of a large number of individual personal injury cases in Florida which could have a material adverse effect on us. In June 2002, the jury in Lukacs v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, an individual case brought under the third phase of the Engle case, awarded $37.5 million (subsequently reduced by the court to $24.9 million) of compensatory damages against Liggett and two other defendants and found Liggett 50% responsible for the damages. The plaintiff has recently moved for the trial court to enter final judgment in this matter and to tax costs and attorneys fees. A hearing on the motion occurred on March 15, 2007. Liggett may be required to bond the amount of the judgment against it to perfect its appeal. It is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the Engle case. Liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so. We cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met. Regulation, legislation and taxation may negatively impact sales of tobacco products and our financial condition. In recent years, there have been a number of proposed restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies, including the EPA and the FDA. Recently, legislation was reintroduced in Congress providing for regulation of cigarettes by the FDA. The proposal would give the FDA authority to impose product standards relating to, among other things, nicotine yields and smoke constituents. The proposal would also restrict marketing and impose larger warning labels on tobacco products. There have also been adverse 28 Table of Contents political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry. The industry is also subject to a wide range of laws regarding the marketing, sale, taxation (both federal and state) and use of tobacco products imposed by local, state and federal governments. These developments generally receive widespread media attention. We are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation. Our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco-related litigation or enactment of any of the proposed regulations or legislation, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. The regulation, legislation and taxation of the industry will likely continue to have an adverse effect on the sale of tobacco products. Liggett may have additional payment obligations under the Master Settlement Agreement and its other settlement agreements with the states. In October 2004, the Independent Auditor notified Liggett and all other participating manufacturers that their payment obligations under the Master Settlement Agreement, dating from the agreements execution in late 1998, were going to be recalculated utilizing net unit amounts, rather than gross unit amounts (which had been utilized since 1999). The change in the method of calculation could, among other things, require additional payments by Liggett under the Master Settlement Agreement of approximately $14.8 million for the periods 2001 through 2006, and require Liggett to pay an additional amount of approximately $3.4 million in 2007 and in future periods by lowering Liggetts market share exemption under the Master Settlement Agreement. Liggett has objected to this retroactive change and has disputed the change in methodology. No amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any potential liability relating to the gross versus net dispute. In 2005, the Independent Auditor under the Master Settlement Agreement calculated that Liggett owed $28.7 million for its 2004 sales. In April 2005, Liggett paid $11.7 million and disputed the balance, as permitted by the Master Settlement Agreement. Liggett subsequently paid an additional $9.3 million of the disputed amount although Liggett continues to dispute that this amount is owed. This $9.3 million relates to an adjustment to its 2003 payment obligation claimed by Liggett for the market share loss to non-participating manufacturers, which is known as the NPM Adjustment. The remaining balance in dispute of $7.7 million, which was withheld from payment, is comprised of $5.3 million claimed for a 2004 NPM Adjustment and $2.4 million relating to the Independent Auditors retroactive change from gross to net units in calculating Master Settlement Agreement payments, which Liggett contends is improper, as discussed above. From its April 2006 payment, Liggett withheld $1.6 million claimed for the 2005 NPM Adjustment and $2.6 million relating to the retroactive change from gross to net units. The following amounts have not been accrued in our consolidated financial statements as they relate to Liggetts claims for NPM Adjustments: $6.5 million for 2003, $3.8 million for 2004 and $0.8 million for 2005. In 2004, the Attorneys General for each of Florida, Mississippi and Texas advised Liggett that they believed that Liggett had failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states for the period 1998 through 2003 and that additional payments may be due for 2004 and subsequent years. Liggett believes these allegations are without merit, based, among other things, on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements. In December 2004, Florida offered to settle all amounts allegedly owed by Liggett for the period through 2003 for the sum of $13.5 million. In March 2005, Florida reaffirmed its December 2004 offer to settle and provided Liggett with a 60 day notice to cure the alleged defaults. Liggett offered Florida $2.5 million in a lump sum to settle all alleged obligations through December 31, 2006 and $100,000 per year thereafter in any year in which cigarettes manufactured by Liggett are sold in Florida, to resolve all alleged future obligations under the settlement agreement. There can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached. In November 2004, the State of Mississippi offered to settle all amounts allegedly owed by Liggett for the period through 2003 for the sum of $6.5 million. In April 2005, Mississippi reaffirmed its November 2004 offer to settle and provided Liggett with a 60 day notice to cure the alleged defaults. No specific monetary demand has been made by Texas. Liggett has met with representatives of Mississippi and Texas to discuss the issues relating to the alleged defaults, although no resolution has been reached. 29 Table of Contents Except for $2.0 million accrued for the year ended December 31, 2005 and an additional $500,000 accrued during the third quarter of 2006, in connection with the foregoing matters, no other amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any additional amounts that may be payable by Liggett under the settlement agreements with Florida, Mississippi and Texas. There can be no assurance that Liggett will prevail in any of these matters and that Liggett will not be required to make additional material payments, which payments could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows and the value of our common stock. Liggett has significant sales to a single customer. During 2006, 10.8% of Liggetts total revenues and 10.6% of our consolidated revenues were generated by sales to Liggetts largest customer. Liggetts contract with this customer currently extends through March 31, 2009. If this customer discontinues its relationship with Liggett or experiences financial difficulties, Liggetts results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Liggett may be adversely affected by recent legislation to eliminate the federal tobacco quota system. In October 2004, federal legislation was enacted which eliminated the federal tobacco quota system and price support system through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders. Pursuant to the legislation, manufacturers of tobacco products will be assessed $10.1 billion over a ten-year period to compensate tobacco growers and quota holders for the elimination of their quota rights. Cigarette manufacturers will initially be responsible for 96.3% of the assessment (subject to adjustment in the future), which will be allocated based on relative unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments. Liggetts and Vector Tobaccos assessment was $25.3 million in 2005 and $22.6 million in 2006. Management currently estimates that Liggetts and Vector Tobaccos assessment will be approximately $22.9 million for the third year of the program which began January 1, 2007. The relative cost of the legislation to each of the three largest cigarette manufacturers will likely be less than the cost to smaller manufacturers, including Liggett and Vector Tobacco, because one effect of the legislation is that the three largest manufacturers will no longer be obligated to make certain contractual payments, commonly known as Phase II payments, they agreed in 1999 to make to tobacco-producing states. The ultimate impact of this legislation cannot be determined, but there is a risk that smaller manufacturers, such as Liggett and Vector Tobacco, will be disproportionately affected by the legislation, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Excise tax increases adversely affect cigarette sales. Cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing federal, state and local excise taxes. The federal excise tax on cigarettes is currently $0.39 per pack. State and local sales and excise taxes vary considerably and, when combined with the current federal excise tax, may currently exceed $4.00 per pack. In 2006, eight states enacted increases in excise taxes. Further increases from other states are expected. Congress has considered and is currently considering significant increases in the federal excise tax or other payments from tobacco manufacturers, and various states and other jurisdictions have currently under consideration or pending legislation proposing further state excise tax increases. We believe that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes. Further substantial federal or state excise tax increases could accelerate the trend away from smoking and could have a material adverse effect on Liggetts sales and profitability, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. Vector Tobacco is subject to risks inherent in new product development initiatives. We have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in Vector Tobaccos development projects in the tobacco industry. Vector Tobacco is in the business of developing and marketing the low nicotine and nicotine-free QUEST cigarette products and developing reduced risk cigarette products. These initiatives are subject to high levels of risk, uncertainties and contingencies, including the challenges inherent in new product development. There is a risk that continued investments in Vector Tobacco will harm our results of operations, liquidity or cash flow. 30 Table of Contents The substantial risks facing Vector Tobacco include: Risks of market acceptance of new products. In November 2001, Vector Tobacco launched nationwide its reduced carcinogen OMNI cigarettes. During 2002, acceptance of OMNI in the marketplace was limited, with revenues of only approximately $5.1 million on sales of 70.7 million units. Since 2003, Vector Tobacco has not been actively marketing the OMNI product, and the product is not currently in distribution. Vector Tobacco was unable to achieve the anticipated breadth of distribution and sales of the OMNI product due, in part, to the lack of success of its advertising and marketing efforts in differentiating OMNI from other conventional cigarettes with consumers through the reduced carcinogen message. Over the next several years, our in-house research program, together with third-party collaborators, plans to conduct appropriate studies relating to the development of cigarettes that materially reduce risk to smokers and, based on these studies, we will evaluate whether, and how, to further market the OMNI brand. OMNI has not been a commercially successful product to date and is not currently being manufactured by Vector Tobacco. Vector Tobacco introduced its low nicotine and nicotine-free QUEST cigarettes in an initial seven-state market in January 2003 and in Arizona in January 2004. During the second quarter of 2004, based on an analysis of the market data obtained since the introduction of the QUEST product, we determined to postpone indefinitely the national launch of QUEST. A national launch of the QUEST brands would require the expenditure of substantial additional sums for advertising and sales promotion, with no assurance of consumer acceptance. Low nicotine and nicotine-free cigarettes may not ultimately be accepted by adult smokers and also may not prove to be commercially successful products. Adult smokers may decide not to purchase cigarettes made with low nicotine and nicotine-free tobaccos due to taste or other preferences or other product modifications. Third party allegations that Vector Tobacco products are unlawful or bear deceptive or unsubstantiated product claims. Vector Tobacco is engaged in the development and marketing of low nicotine and nicotine-free cigarettes and the development of reduced risk cigarette products. With respect to OMNI, which is not currently being distributed by Vector Tobacco, reductions in carcinogens have not yet been proven to result in a safer cigarette. Like other cigarettes, the OMNI and QUEST products also produce tar, carbon monoxide, other harmful by-products, and, in the case of OMNI, increased levels of nitric oxide and formaldehyde. There are currently no specific governmental standards or parameters for these products and product claims. There is a risk that federal or state regulators may object to Vector Tobaccos low nicotine and nicotine-free cigarette products and reduced risk cigarette products it may develop as unlawful or allege they bear deceptive or unsubstantiated product claims, and seek the removal of the products from the marketplace, or significant changes to advertising. Various concerns regarding Vector Tobaccos advertising practices have been expressed to Vector Tobacco by certain state attorneys general. Vector Tobacco has previously engaged in discussions in an effort to resolve these concerns and Vector Tobacco has, in the interim, suspended all print advertising for its QUEST brand. If Vector Tobacco is unable to advertise its QUEST brand, it could have a material adverse effect on sales of QUEST. Allegations by federal or state regulators, public health organizations and other tobacco manufacturers that Vector Tobaccos products are unlawful, or that its public statements or advertising contain misleading or unsubstantiated health claims or product comparisons, may result in litigation or governmental proceedings. Vector Tobaccos defense against such claims could require it to incur substantial expense and to divert significant efforts of its scientific and marketing personnel. An adverse determination in a judicial proceeding or by a regulatory agency could have a material and adverse impact on Vector Tobaccos business, operating results and prospects. Potential extensive government regulation. Vector Tobaccos business may become subject to extensive additional domestic and international government regulation. Various proposals have been made for federal, state and international legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers generally, and reduced constituent cigarettes specifically. It is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted covering matters such as the manufacture, sale, distribution and labeling of tobacco products as well as any health claims associated with reduced risk and low nicotine and nicotine-free cigarette products and the use of genetically modified tobacco. A system of regulation by agencies such as the FDA, the FTC and the USDA may be established. Recently, legislation was reintroduced in Congress providing for the regulation of cigarettes by the FDA. The outcome of 31 Table of Contents any of the foregoing cannot be predicted, but any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Vector Tobaccos business, operating results and prospects. Competition from other cigarette manufacturers with greater resources. Vector Tobaccos competitors generally have substantially greater resources than Vector Tobacco has, including financial, marketing and personnel resources. Other major tobacco companies have stated that they are working on reduced risk cigarette products and have made publicly available at this time only limited additional information concerning their activities. Philip Morris has announced it is developing products that potentially reduce smokers exposure to harmful compounds in cigarette smoke. RJR Tobacco has disclosed that a primary focus for its research and development activity is the development of potentially reduced exposure products, which may ultimately be recognized as products that present reduced risks to health. RJR Tobacco has stated that it continues to sell in limited distribution throughout the country a brand of cigarettes that primarily heats rather than burns tobacco, which it claims reduces the toxicity of its smoke. There is a substantial likelihood that other major tobacco companies will continue to introduce new products that are designed to compete directly with the low nicotine, nicotine-free and reduced risk products that Vector Tobacco currently markets or may develop. Potential disputes concerning intellectual property. Vector Tobaccos ability to commercialize its reduced carcinogen and low nicotine and nicotine-free products may depend in large part on its ability to obtain and defend issued patents, to obtain further patent protection for its existing technology in the United States and abroad, and to operate without infringing on the patents and rights of others both in the United States and abroad. Additionally, it must be able to obtain appropriate licenses to patents and proprietary rights held by third parties, or issued to third parties, if infringement would otherwise occur, both in the United States and abroad. Intellectual property rights, including Vector Tobaccos patents involve complex legal and factual issues. Any conflicts resulting from third party patent applications and granted patents could significantly limit Vector Tobaccos ability to obtain meaningful patent protection or to commercialize its technology. If patents currently exist or are issued to other companies that contain claims which encompass Vector Tobaccos products or the processes used by Vector Tobacco to manufacture or develop its products, Vector Tobacco may be required to obtain licenses to use these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. Licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If licenses are not obtained, Vector Tobacco could be delayed in, or prevented from, pursuing the further development of marketing of its new cigarette products. Any alternative technology, if feasible, could take several years to develop. Litigation, which could result in substantial cost, also may be necessary to enforce any patents to which Vector Tobacco has rights, or to determine the scope, validity and unenforceability of other parties proprietary rights which may affect Vector Tobaccos rights. Vector Tobacco also may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine the priority of an invention or in opposition proceedings in foreign countries or jurisdictions, which could result in substantial costs. The mere uncertainty resulting from the institution and continuation of any technology-related litigation or any interference or opposition proceedings could have a material adverse effect on Vector Tobaccos business, operating results and prospects. Vector Tobacco may also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know-how to maintain its competitive position, which it seeks to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, suppliers and others. There is a risk that these agreements will be breached or terminated, that Vector Tobacco will not have adequate remedies for any breach, or that its trade secrets will otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Dependence on key scientific personnel. Vector Tobaccos business depends on the continued services of key scientific personnel for its continued development and growth. The loss of Dr. Anthony Albino, Vector Tobaccos Senior Vice President of Public Health Affairs, could have a serious negative impact upon Vector Tobaccos business, operating results and prospects. 32 Table of Contents Ability to raise capital and manage growth of business. If Vector Tobacco succeeds in introducing to market and increasing consumer acceptance for its new cigarette products, Vector Tobacco will be required to obtain significant amounts of additional capital and manage substantial volume from its customers. There is a risk that adequate amounts of additional capital will not be available to Vector Tobacco to fund the growth of its business. To accommodate growth and compete effectively, Vector Tobacco will also be required to attract, integrate, motivate and retain additional highly skilled sales, technical and other employees. Vector Tobacco will face competition for these people. Its ability to manage volume also will depend on its ability to scale up its tobacco processing, production and distribution operations. There is a risk that it will not succeed in scaling its processing, production and distribution operations and that its personnel, systems, procedures and controls will not be adequate to support its future operations. Potential delays in obtaining tobacco and other raw materials needed to produce products. Vector Tobacco is dependent on third parties to produce tobacco and other raw materials that Vector Tobacco requires to manufacture its products. In addition, the growing of new tobacco and new seeds is subject to adverse weather conditions. The failure by such third parties to supply Vector Tobacco with tobacco or other raw materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, in the absence of readily available alternative sources, would have a serious negative impact on Vector Tobaccos business, operating results and prospects. There is also a risk that interruptions in the supply of these materials may occur in the future. Any interruption in their supply could have a serious negative impact on Vector Tobacco. The actual costs and savings associated with restructurings of our tobacco business may differ materially from amounts we estimate. In recent years, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to streamline the cost structure of our tobacco business and improve operating efficiency and long-term earnings. For example, during 2002, the sales, marketing and support functions of our Liggett and Vector Tobacco subsidiaries were combined. Effective year-end 2003, we closed Vector Tobaccos Timberlake, North Carolina manufacturing facility and moved all production to Liggetts facility in Mebane, North Carolina. In April 2004, we eliminated a number of positions in our tobacco operations and subleased excess office space. In December 2004, we restructured the operations of Liggett Vector Brands. In November 2006, we eliminated positions at Vector Research and terminated certain license agreements associated with the genetics operation. We may consider various additional opportunities to further improve efficiencies and reduce costs. These prior and current initiatives have involved material restructuring and impairment charges, and any future actions taken are likely to involve material charges as well. These restructuring charges are based on our best estimate at the time of restructuring. The status of the restructuring activities is reviewed on a quarterly basis and any adjustments to the reserve, which could differ materially from previous estimates, are recorded as an adjustment to operating income. Although we may estimate that substantial cost savings will be associated with these restructuring actions, there is a risk that these actions could have a serious negative impact on our tobacco business and that any estimated increases in profitability cannot be achieved. New Valley is subject to risks relating to the industries in which it operates. Risks of real estate ventures. New Valley has three significant investments, Douglas Elliman Realty, LLC, the Sheraton Keauhou Bay Resort & Spa (which reopened in the fourth quarter 2004) and the St. Regis Hotel in Washington, D. C. (since August 2005), in each of which it holds only a 50% interest. In addition, New Valley has a 22.22% interest in a condominium hotel project in Islamorada, Florida. New Valley must seek approval from other parties for important actions regarding these joint ventures. Since these other parties interests may differ from those of New Valley, a deadlock could arise that might impair the ability of the ventures to function. Such a deadlock could significantly harm the ventures. New Valley may pursue a variety of real estate development projects. Development projects are subject to special risks including potential increase in costs, changes in market demand, inability to meet deadlines which may delay the timely completion of projects, reliance on contractors who may be unable to perform and the need to obtain various governmental and third party consents. 33 Table of Contents Risks relating to the residential brokerage business. Through New Valleys investment in Douglas Elliman Realty, LLC, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties endemic to the residential brokerage business. Both Douglas Elliman and Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate operate as franchisees of The Prudential Real Estate Affiliates, Inc. Prudential Douglas Elliman operates each of its offices under its franchisers brand name, but generally does not own any of the brand names under which it operates. The franchiser has significant rights over the use of the franchised service marks and the conduct of the two brokerage companies business. The franchise agreements require the companies to:  coordinate with the franchiser on significant matters relating to their operations, including the opening and closing of offices;  make substantial royalty payments to the franchiser and contribute significant amounts to national advertising funds maintained by the franchiser;  indemnify the franchiser against losses arising out of the operations of their business under the franchise agreements; and  maintain standards and comply with guidelines relating to their operations which are applicable to all franchisees of the franchisers real estate franchise system. The franchiser has the right to terminate Douglas Ellimans and Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estates franchises, upon the occurrence of certain events, including a bankruptcy or insolvency event, a change in control, a transfer of rights under the franchise agreement and a failure to promptly pay amounts due under the franchise agreements. A termination of Douglas Ellimans or Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estates franchise agreement could adversely affect our investment in Douglas Elliman Realty. The franchise agreements grant Douglas Elliman and Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate exclusive franchises in New York for the counties of Nassau and Suffolk on Long Island and for Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, subject to various exceptions and to meeting specified annual revenue thresholds. If the two companies fail to achieve these levels of revenues for two consecutive years or otherwise materially breach the franchise agreements, the franchisor would have the right to terminate their exclusivity rights. A loss of these rights could have a material adverse on Douglas Elliman Realty. Interest rates in the United States have been at historically low levels in recent years. The low interest rate environment in recent years has significantly contributed to high levels of existing home sales and residential prices and has positively impacted Douglas Elliman Realtys operating results. However, the residential real estate market tends to be cyclical and typically is affected by changes in the general economic conditions that are beyond Douglas Elliman Realtys control. Any of the following could have a material adverse effect on Douglas Elliman Realtys residential business by causing a general decline in the number of home sales and/or prices, which in turn, could adversely affect its revenues and profitability:  periods of economic slowdown or recession,  a change in the low interest rate environment resulting in rising interest rates,  decreasing home ownership rates, or  declining demand for real estate. All of Douglas Elliman Realtys current operations are located in the New York metropolitan area. Local and regional economic conditions in this market could differ materially from prevailing conditions in other parts of the country. A downturn in the residential real estate market or economic conditions in that region could have a material adverse effect on Douglas Elliman Realty and our investment in that company. Potential new investments we may make are unidentified and may not succeed. We currently hold a significant amount of marketable securities and cash not committed to any specific investments. This subjects a security holder to increased risk and uncertainty because a security holder will not be able to evaluate how this cash will be invested and the economic merits of particular investments. There 34 Table of Contents may be substantial delay in locating suitable investment opportunities. In addition, we may lack relevant management experience in the areas in which we may invest. There is a risk that we will fail in targeting, consummating or effectively integrating or managing any of these investments. We depend on our key personnel. We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations. We are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to assess, and our independent registered certified public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. We completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to continue to comply with these requirements. We expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to Section 404 compliance. In the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered certified public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions and our reputation may be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell the shares of our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. The trading price of our common stock has ranged between $14.47 and $19.13 per share over the past 52 weeks. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;  the operating and stock performance of our competitors;  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contract, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  the initiation or outcome of litigation;  changes in interest rates;  general economic, market and political conditions;  additions or departures of key personnel; and  future sales of our equity or convertible securities. We cannot predict the extent, if any, to which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, may depress the trading price of our common stock or the value of the debentures. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of 35 Table of Contents our operating performance. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management. These factors, among others, could significantly depress the price of our common stock. We have many potentially dilutive securities outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding options granted to employees to purchase approximately 8,930,764 shares of our common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $10.22 per share, of which options for 8,588,528 shares were exercisable at December 31, 2006. We also have outstanding convertible notes and debentures maturing in November 2011 and June 2026, which are currently convertible into 11,727,002 shares of our common stock. The issuance of these shares will cause dilution which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The availability for sale of significant quantities of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
