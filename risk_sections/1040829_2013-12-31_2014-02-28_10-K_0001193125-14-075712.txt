Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following specific risk factors as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as these are important factors, among others, that could cause our actual results to differ from our expected or historical results. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all our potential risks or uncertainties. Some statements in the Business section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements and are qualified by the cautionary language regarding such statements. See Forward-Looking Statements above. If we fail to qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income. Pursuant to our 2012 restructuring, we took the steps necessary to elect to be treated as a REIT for tax purposes, effective for the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. To qualify as a REIT, we hold our non-qualifying REIT assets in one or more TRSs. These non-qualifying REIT assets consist principally of non-real estate assets related to our Hospitality segment and the assets related to our Opry and Attractions segment as historically structured and operated. 10 Table of Contents If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and are not entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code):  we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and  we would be subject to federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. This adverse impact could last for five or more years because, unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be taxable as a C corporation, beginning in the year in which the failure occurs, and we would not be allowed to re-elect to be taxed as a REIT for the following four years. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate certain assets to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be reduced. REIT qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code to our operations, as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we plan to operate in a manner consistent with the REIT qualification rules, we cannot assure you that we will so qualify or remain so qualified. As a REIT, failure to make required distributions to our stockholders would subject us to federal and state corporate income tax. Prior to 2012, we had not paid a cash distribution on our common stock since 1999. For 2013 we declared, and we intend to continue to declare, regular quarterly distributions, the amount of which will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. Our board of directors has approved a dividend policy pursuant to which we will pay a quarterly cash dividend in an amount equal to an annualized payment of at least 50% of adjusted funds from operations (as defined by us) or 100% of REIT taxable income on an annual basis, whichever is greater. This dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors and certain provisions of our debt agreements may prohibit us from paying dividends in accordance with the policy. To qualify and be taxed as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. If our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain the proposed quarterly distributions that approximate our taxable income, and may fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT. In addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal and state income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code. Covenants in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required distributions to our stockholders in accordance with our announced intended dividend policy. Our $1 billion credit facility imposes, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, operating and financial restrictions on our activities, including restrictions on the payment of dividends. These restrictions may prevent us from making distributions to our stockholders in accordance with our announced intended dividend policy. We may be required to borrow funds, sell assets, or issue equity to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements or maintain the asset ownership tests. To meet the REIT distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or issue equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. Any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our REIT distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. This would increase our total leverage. 11 Table of Contents In addition, if we fail to comply with certain REIT asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive assets. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock. Thus, compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some REIT requirements prior to closing. In addition, as a REIT, we may face investor pressures to forego growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive. We conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including those currently operated within our Opry and Attractions segment, through TRSs. Under the Code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other non-qualifying assets. This limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our Opry and Attractions segment as historically structured and operated or in other non-REIT qualifying operations or assets. To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, sell assets or issue equity to fund these distributions, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. Our planned use of TRSs may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs and certain other non-qualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, we would fail to qualify as a REIT. If our leases of our hotel properties to TRS lessees are not true leases for federal income tax purposes, we may fail to qualify as a REIT. In order for the lease payments by our TRS lessees to our property-owning subsidiaries to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the lease or sublease must be considered a true lease for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as a service contract, joint venture, or some other type of arrangement. We believe we have structured our leases and subleases of our hotel properties to our TRS lessees so that the leases will be considered true leases for federal income tax purposes, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this characterization. If Marriott or any future third-party hotel manager fails to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, or if our hotels are not qualified lodging facilities, we will fail to qualify as a REIT. Rent paid by a lessee or sublessee that is a related party tenant of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. An exception is provided, however, for leases of qualified lodging facilities to a TRS so long as the hotels are managed by an eligible independent contractor and certain other requirements are satisfied. We lease or sublease our hotel properties to TRS lessees, and such TRS lessees have engaged Marriott as a third-party hotel manager. We believe Marriott and any other third-party hotel manager that our TRS lessees may engage in the future will qualify as eligible independent contractors for federal income tax purposes. Among other requirements, to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, the third-party hotel manager must not own, directly or through its stockholders, more than 35% of our outstanding shares, and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the shares (or ownership interest) of the third-party hotel manager, 12 Table of Contents taking into account certain ownership attribution rules. The ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of these 35% thresholds are complex, and monitoring actual and constructive ownership of our shares by the third-party hotel manager and their owners may not be practical. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded. In addition, for a third-party hotel manager to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, such company or a related person must be actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified lodging facilities (as defined below) for one or more persons not related to the REIT or its TRSs at each time that such company enters into a hotel management contract with a TRS lessee. We believe that Marriott operates qualified lodging facilities for certain persons who are not related to us or our TRSs, and Marriott has agreed in the hotel management agreements that it, or its affiliates, are eligible independent contractors and will maintain such status. However, no assurances can be provided that Marriott or any other hotel managers that we may engage in the future will in fact comply with this requirement. Failure to comply with this requirement would require us to find other third-party hotel managers for future contracts, and, if we hired a third-party hotel manager without knowledge of the failure, it could jeopardize our status as a REIT. Finally, each property with respect to which our TRS lessees pay rent must be a qualified lodging facility. A qualified lodging facility is a hotel, motel or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who is legally authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. We believe that our current hotel properties are qualified lodging facilities. Although we intend to monitor future acquisitions and improvements of properties, REIT provisions of the Code provide only limited guidance for making determinations under the requirements for qualified lodging facilities, and there can be no assurance that these requirements will be satisfied. Our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. A REIT generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and plans for future acquisitions and divestitures. Our board of directors has approved a dividend policy pursuant to which we will pay a quarterly cash dividend based on an annualized amount of at least 50% of adjusted funds from operations (as defined by us) or 100% of REIT taxable income on an annual basis, whichever is greater. The dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors and certain provisions of our debt agreements may prohibit us from paying dividends in accordance with the policy. Consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate. There are uncertainties relating to the estimate of our special dividend paid on December 21, 2012. To qualify for taxation as a REIT effective for the year ended December 31, 2013, we were required to distribute to our stockholders our undistributed accumulated earnings and profits attributable to taxable periods ended prior to January 1, 2013. To satisfy this requirement, on November 2, 2012, our board of directors declared a special dividend in the amount of $6.84 per share of common stock, or an aggregate of approximately $309.8 million to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2012, payable on December 21, 2012 in a combination of cash and stock, as elected by stockholders. We believe that the total value of the special dividend was sufficient to fully distribute our accumulated earnings and profits and that a portion of the special dividend exceeded our accumulated earnings and profits. However, the amount of our undistributed accumulated earnings and profits is a complex factual and legal determination. We may have had less than complete information at the time we estimated our earnings and profits or may have interpreted the applicable law differently from the IRS. Substantial uncertainties exist relating to the computation of our undistributed accumulated earnings and profits, including the possibility that the IRS could, in auditing tax years through 2012, successfully assert that our taxable income should be increased, which could increase our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits. Thus, we may fail to satisfy the requirement to distribute all of our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits by the close of our first taxable year as a REIT. Moreover, although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits, we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of them or the economic impact to us of doing so. 13 Table of Contents Even though we are conducting our business as a REIT, certain of our business activities will be subject to corporate level income tax, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities. Even though we are conducting our business as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state, and local taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income, and state or local income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. In addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. Our business related to the non-real estate assets of our Hospitality segment and the assets of our Opry and Attractions segment is conducted through wholly-owned TRSs because these activities could generate non-qualifying REIT income as historically structured and operated. Those TRS assets and operations continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. In addition, net operating losses in any of our TRSs generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for use against current or future taxable income in the TRSs. We are also subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate (currently 35%) on all or a portion of the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within a specified period (generally, ten years) after the REIT conversion is completed, to the extent of the built-in gain based on the fair market value of those assets on the effective date of the REIT election in excess of our then tax basis. That tax on subsequently sold assets will be based on the fair market value and built-in gain of those assets as of January 1, 2013. Gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax. We currently do not expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability. We cannot, however, assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard. In addition, the IRS and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified as a REIT, in which case we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties, if any. Moreover, any increase in taxable income for these pre-REIT periods will likely result in an increase in pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits, which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our stockholders after the relevant determination. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the costs of our hedging, and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. The REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge liabilities. Generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to any non-U.S. operations do not constitute gross income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. We have little experience operating as a REIT, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy debt service obligations and make distributions to our stockholders. Our senior management team has little experience operating a REIT. We cannot assure you that our past experience will be sufficient to operate our company successfully as a REIT. Failure to maintain REIT status could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy debt service obligations and make distributions to our stockholders. Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders. At any time, the federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the United States Department of the Treasury and state taxing authorities. Changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any such change will not significantly affect our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences to us of such qualification. 14 Table of Contents The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification, without stockholder approval, may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (Charter) provides that the board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate the REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to be a REIT, we will not be allowed a tax deduction with respect to distributions to our stockholders in computing our taxable income, and we will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders. If our third-party hotel managers do not manage our hotel properties or other businesses successfully, our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders may be negatively impacted. Due to federal income tax laws that restrict REITs from operating and managing hotels, we do not operate or manage the day-to-day functions of any of our hotel properties as a REIT. We lease or sublease our hotel properties to TRSs, and such TRS lessees have engaged Marriott as a third-party hotel manager pursuant to hotel management agreements. Marriott assumed management of the day-to-day operations of our Gaylord Hotels properties effective October 1, 2012, and of the Inn at Opryland effective December 1, 2012. We will identify third-party hotel managers to operate and manage any hotels that we acquire in the future. Our third-party hotel managers will be responsible for the day-to-day management of our hotel properties, including, but not limited to, implementing significant operating decisions, setting rates for rooms and meeting space, controlling revenue and expenditures, collecting accounts receivable, and recruiting, employing and supervising employees at our hotel properties. We will not have the authority to require our third-party hotel managers to operate our hotel properties in a particular manner, although we will have consent and approval rights for certain matters under our hotel management agreements with Marriott, subject to the limitations described therein. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders are largely dependent on the ability of our third-party hotel managers to operate our hotel properties successfully. Any failure by our third-party hotel managers to provide quality services and amenities or to maintain and protect a quality brand name and reputation could have a negative impact on their ability to operate and manage our hotel properties successfully and could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders. We cannot assure you that our third-party hotel managers will operate and manage our hotel properties in a manner that is consistent with their obligations under the hotel management agreements, that our third-party hotel managers will not be negligent in their performance or engage in other criminal or fraudulent activity, or that they will not otherwise default on their management obligations to us. Even if we believe our hotel properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operational metrics, we will have limited ability to require our third-party hotel managers to change their method of operation of our hotel properties. We generally will attempt to resolve issues with third-party hotel managers through discussions and negotiations. However, if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution or arbitration. We would be able to seek redress only if a third-party hotel manager violates the terms of the applicable hotel management agreement, and then only to the extent of the remedies provided for under the terms of the hotel management agreement. Additionally, in the event we need to replace any of our third-party hotel managers, we may experience significant business disruptions at the affected hotel properties, and may be liable, under certain circumstances, for significant damages and/or be required to make certain payments to our third-party managers. The operation and management of our current hotel properties, the operation of which generates substantially all our Hospitality segment revenue, is concentrated in Marriott. Our current hotel properties, the operation of which generates substantially all our Hospitality segment revenue, are operated and managed by Marriott. As a result, our operational risk is concentrated in one third-party hotel manager, which makes us more vulnerable economically to any weakness of Marriott than if we entered into hotel management agreements with several third-party hotel managers. We cannot assure you that Marriott will satisfy its obligations to us or successfully operate and manage our current hotel properties. Any adverse developments in Marriotts business and affairs, financial strength or ability to operate and manage our current hotel properties successfully could materially reduce our revenues and net income, which could in turn reduce the amount of distributions to our stockholders. Additionally, we rely on the resources of and financial information provided by Marriott to report the 15 Table of Contents financial results of our hotel properties. A failure by Marriott to accurately report the financial results of our hotel properties could materially affect our understanding of the hotel properties performance as well as our ability to accurately report on the hotel properties performance. Further, Marriott now owns the Gaylord Hotels brand and trademarks, and a failure on their part to maintain quality standards could harm the brand and damage our business. We may not realize revenue enhancements and cost synergies as a result of transitioning the management of our hotels to Marriott to the degree or as soon as we anticipate. Revenue growth and cost synergies for our hotel operations are largely dependent on the efforts of Marriott. The results of Marriotts efforts to leverage its rewards program, customer channels and brands, as well as its management of demand for rooms, meeting space and banquets, may not result in revenue growth to the extent or in the timeframe we anticipate. In addition, Marriotts efforts to reduce hotel-level costs may not result in long-term cost savings in the amounts or in the timeframes that we anticipate. Further, we may not be able to identify additional opportunities to implement costs improvement strategies at the corporate level. While we have worked jointly with Marriott to target sales and costs improvements, there can be no assurance that our efforts will succeed. Restrictive covenants and other provisions in our hotel management agreements with third-party hotel managers could limit our ability to sell or lease our hotel properties or refinance our existing debt. Our hotel management agreements with Marriott contain, and we anticipate that hotel management agreements with our future third-party hotel managers will contain, restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility to sell or lease our hotel properties. For example, we may not sell or lease our current hotel properties to a competitor of Marriott (as defined in our management agreements with Marriott), and any purchaser or lessee must have, in Marriotts judgment, sufficient financial resources and liquidity to fulfill our obligations under the hotel management agreements. Such restrictions on our ability to sell or lease our hotel properties could negatively affect the marketability of our hotel properties and restrict our ability to refinance our existing debt secured by our hotel properties. Marriott and any future third-party hotel manager may own or operate hotels that compete with our hotel properties. Our third-party hotel managers may own or operate hotels that compete with our current hotel properties and any hotel properties that we acquire, which may result in a conflict of interest. For example, Marriott and its affiliates own, have invested in, operate, and have provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete or will compete with our current hotel properties, including the Marriott Orlando World Center, which competes with Gaylord Palms, and the Washington Marriott Marquis, which competes with Gaylord National. As a result, our third-party hotel managers may make decisions regarding competing hotel properties that are not or would not be in our best interest. In addition, such third-party hotel managers operation of other hotels may divert attention away from the operation and management of our hotel properties. Our concentration in the hospitality industry, and in particular the group-oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry, exposes us to certain risks outside of our and Marriotts control. Our primary business is hotel-related, and our current hotel properties, the operation of which generates substantially all our Hospitality segment revenue, are concentrated in the group-oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry. Therefore, a downturn in the lodging industry, in general, and the group-oriented meetings sector, in particular, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders. The ability of Marriott to successfully operate and manage our current hotel properties and convention business is subject to factors beyond our and their control, which could reduce the revenue and operating income of these properties. These factors include:  the desirability and perceived attractiveness of the Nashville, Tennessee; Orlando, Florida; Dallas, Texas; and Washington D.C. areas as tourist and convention destinations;  adverse changes in the national economy and in the levels of tourism and convention business that affect our current hotel properties;  the level of governmental group business, which may decrease due to uncertainty surrounding the U.S. government budget; 16 Table of Contents  Marriotts ability to attract group convention business;  Marriotts ability to contract for and collect attrition and cancellation fees from groups that do not fulfill minimum stay or spending requirements;  the opening of other new hotels could impact the group convention business at our current hotel properties;  the highly competitive nature of the hotel, tourism and convention business in which our hotel properties operate, including the fact that we compete for convention business with publicly-financed civic convention centers;  the susceptibility of group convention business to reduced levels of demand during the year-end holiday periods, which Marriott may not be able to offset by attracting sufficient general tourism guests;  the financial condition of the airline and other transportation-related industries and the resulting impact on travel; and  organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from our hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of group business. These factors could reduce the revenues and net operating profits of our TRS lessees, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders. Due to the geographic concentration of our current hotel properties, we are subject to a greater degree of risk to certain factors. Due to the geographic concentration of our current hotel properties, we are subject to a greater degree of risk to factors, including:  local economic and competitive conditions;  natural and other disasters;  a decline in air passenger travel due to higher ticket costs or fears concerning air travel;  a decline in the attractiveness of the areas in which our hotels are located as a convention and tourism destination; and  a decrease in convention and meeting business at any of our properties. Any of these could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders. There is no assurance that the recent reorganization within and downsizing of our executive management team will not adversely affect our operations. We depend on the efforts and expertise of our executive management team to manage our day-to-day operations and strategic business direction. In connection with the REIT conversion, we reorganized and reduced the number of members of our executive management team and other employees within the Corporate and Other segment to reflect the fact that we no longer operate or manage our hotel properties, which has resulted in a more streamlined corporate overhead and executive management structure. There is no assurance that the reorganization and reductions will not adversely affect our operations, including in connection with our Opry and Attractions segment, certain parts of which we continue to operate and manage. We may be unable to successfully identify and complete future acquisitions, and our previously announced developments will not be pursued in the form we previously anticipated. Acquisitions of other hotels, particularly in the group-oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry, either alone or through joint ventures or alliances with one or more third parties, are part of our long-term growth strategy. We may be unable to successfully identify or complete future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms or, if we are able to find favorable acquisition targets, we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or secure beneficial joint ventures or alliances. We will evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business, including those that could be material in size and scope. 17 Table of Contents The hotel business is capital-intensive, and our inability to obtain financing or successfully complete acquisitions or capital improvements could limit our growth. Acquisitions of hotels will require significant capital expenditures, and hotels that we acquire may need renovations and capital improvements at the time of acquisition. All of our hotel properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. If any hotels that we acquire are subject to franchise agreements, the franchisors of these hotels may also require periodic capital improvements as a condition to our maintaining the franchise licenses. We may not be able to fund capital improvements or acquisitions solely from cash provided from our operating activities because we must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and net of capital gains) each year to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a result, our ability to fund acquisitions or capital expenditures through any retained earnings or operating cash flow will be limited. Consequently, we will rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund hotel acquisitions and improvements. Our ability to grow through acquisitions will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms. In addition, capital improvements may give rise to the following risks:  possible environmental problems;  construction cost overruns and delays;  the possibility that revenues will be reduced while rooms, restaurants or other facilities are out of service due to capital improvement projects;  a possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on attractive terms; and  uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun. The costs of renovations and capital improvements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders. Our TRS lessee structure will subject us to the risk of increased hotel operating expenses and the inability of our TRS lessees to make lease payments to us. Our leases with our TRS lessees will require our TRS lessees to make lease payments to us based in part on gross revenues from our hotel properties. Our operating risks will include decreases in revenues at our hotel properties and increases in operating expenses of our hotel properties. Decreases in revenues or increases in operating expenses could adversely affect our TRS lessees ability to make lease payments due under the leases, including, but not limited to, increases in wage and benefit costs, repair and maintenance expenses, property taxes, insurance costs, and other operating expenses. Increases in those operating expenses can have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our TRS lessees ability to make lease payments will be affected by factors beyond their control, such as changes in general economic conditions, the level of demand for hotels and the related services of our hotel properties, competition in the lodging and hospitality industry, the third-party managers ability to maintain and increase gross revenue at our hotel properties and other factors relating to the operations of our hotel properties. Our substantial debt could reduce our cash flow and limit our business activities. We currently have a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $1.2 billion of total debt, of which $304.1 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 3.75% convertible senior notes is scheduled to mature in 2014. We may incur additional debt in connection with any additional hotel acquisitions, development, renovations, or capital improvement. 18 Table of Contents Our substantial amount of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to make distributions to our stockholders and to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate requirements;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the hospitality industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that are less leveraged;  limit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity; and  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for various projects, including possible expansions of our existing properties and acquisitions of additional properties. In addition, the terms of our $1 billion credit facility allow, and instruments governing any new debt may allow, us to incur substantial amounts of additional debt subject to certain limitations. Any such additional debt could increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage. Although our earnings were sufficient to cover fixed charges in 2013 and 2011, our substantial leverage is evidenced by our earnings being insufficient to cover fixed charges by $25.5 million in 2012. At the time any principal amount of our indebtedness is due, we may not have cash available to pay this amount, and we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. We will be required to refinance our debt before it matures and there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms. Our outstanding 3.75% convertible senior notes mature on October 1, 2014. On or before the maturity date, we may or may not have cash available to pay amounts due, and we may be required to refinance the notes. Currently, the revolving loans, letters of credit and term loans under our $1 billion credit facility mature on April 18, 2017, and we will be required to refinance this facility prior to such date. We also have outstanding $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2021. Our ability to refinance our $1 billion credit facility, our outstanding 3.75% convertible senior notes, and our outstanding 5.00% senior unsecured notes on acceptable terms will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our assets, borrowing restrictions which may be imposed by lenders and conditions in the credit markets at the time we refinance. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to choose from a number of unfavorable options, including agreeing to otherwise unfavorable financing terms, selling one or more hotel properties at unattractive prices or on disadvantageous terms, or defaulting on mortgages and allowing our lenders to foreclose. Any one of these options could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. To service our debt and pay other obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available to us. Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, including our obligations under our convertible senior notes and any future debt we may incur, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend largely upon our future operating performance and our ability to generate cash from operations. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt and other obligations will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants and financial ratios in our senior credit facility and our other debt agreements, including other agreements we may enter into in the future. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or we may not have future borrowings available to us under our credit facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. 19 Table of Contents The agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that may limit our ability to operate our business and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our existing financial agreements, including our $1 billion credit facility impose, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, operating and financial restrictions on our activities, including our ability to make distributions to any stockholder. Our $1 billion credit facility currently requires us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios, including minimum consolidated tangible net worth, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, minimum implied debt service coverage ratio and maximum funded debt to asset value ratio, and our $1 billion credit facility and/or indenture governing the 5.00% senior unsecured notes limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:  incur additional debt, issue guarantees of debt and issue preferred stock;  create liens;  sell assets;  sell equity interests in our restricted subsidiaries;  redeem and/or prepay certain debt;  pay dividends on our stock to our stockholders or repurchase our stock or other equity interests;  make certain investments;  enter new lines of business;  engage in consolidations, mergers and acquisitions;  enter into transactions with affiliates; or  agree to restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to us. If we fail to comply with these covenants, we would be in default under our $1 billion credit facility and the indenture governing the 5.00% senior unsecured notes, and the outstanding principal and accrued interest on such debt would become due and payable. In addition, the indenture governing our 3.75% convertible senior notes restricts mergers under specified circumstances, may require us to offer to purchase the convertible senior notes from the holders upon the occurrence of specified fundamental changes, and may require adjustments in the conversion ratio for the convertible senior notes as a result of dividends or specified make-whole fundamental changes. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions and other corporate opportunities. We do not believe the REIT conversion and the related transactions resulted in a fundamental change or a make-whole fundamental change. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and maintain these financial tests and ratios. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity for the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt, including, in the case of our existing credit facility, our Gaylord Hotels properties. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing and to make distributions to our stockholders in accordance with our announced intended dividend policy. Our indebtedness is secured by a substantial portion of our assets. Subject to applicable laws and certain agreed-upon exceptions, our $1 billion credit facility is secured by liens on the substantial majority of our assets, including mortgages on each of our Gaylord Hotels properties. In the event of a default under our $1 billion credit facility, or if we experience insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the holders of our secured debt instruments would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security, and only then would holders of our unsecured debt be entitled to payment from our remaining assets. 20 Table of Contents We are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries cash flow to meet our debt service obligations. We are a holding company and we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, including our TRSs. As a result, our ability to meet our debt service obligations substantially depends upon our subsidiaries cash flows and payments of funds to us by our subsidiaries as dividends, loans, advances, leases or other payments. The payment of dividends and/or making of loans, advances, leases or other payments by our subsidiaries will be subject to the approval of those subsidiaries boards. Our subsidiaries ability to pay such dividends and/or make such loans, advances, leases or other payments may also be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws and regulations, current and future debt agreements and management agreements into which our subsidiaries may enter. We and our third-party hotel managers will rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security failure of that technology could harm our business. We and our third-party hotel managers will rely on information technology systems, including networks and the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, reservations, billing and operating data. Our businesses require collection of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems and those of our service providers. The integrity and protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. If that data is inaccurate or incomplete, we or the hotel managers could make faulty decisions. Customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding. Our existing systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time to do so. Despite implementation of various measures designed to protect our information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, we or the hotel managers may be subject to security breaches, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data maintained by us or by a service provider or failure to comply with the various U.S. and international laws and regulations applicable to the protection of such data or with Payment Card Industry data security standards, could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines, or litigation. A breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits. Our real estate investments are subject to numerous risks. Because we own hotels and attractions properties, we are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property. Real estate values are expected to be depressed until general economic conditions improve. The investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties, as well as the expenses incurred. In addition, a variety of other factors affect income from properties and real estate values, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels and the availability of financing. For example, new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive and/or time-consuming to develop real property or expand, modify or renovate properties. When interest rates increase, the cost of acquiring, developing, expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases. Similarly, as financing becomes less available, it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property. Finally, governments can, under eminent domain laws, take real property. Sometimes this taking is for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth. Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, equity real estate investments, such as the investments we hold and any additional properties that we may acquire, are relatively difficult to sell quickly. If our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our income will be reduced. Our properties are subject to environmental regulations that could impose significant financial liability on us. Environmental laws, ordinances and regulations of various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate certain of our properties and could make us liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in the properties we currently own or operate or those we previously owned or operated. Those laws could impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly clean up such substances when present, could jeopardize our ability to develop, use, sell or rent the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral. If we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic 21 Table of Contents wastes, we could be liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up wastes at the disposal or treatment facility, even if we never owned or operated that facility. Other laws, ordinances and regulations could require us to manage, abate or remove lead- or asbestos-containing materials. Similarly, the operation and closure of storage tanks are often regulated by federal, state, local and foreign laws. Finally, certain laws, ordinances and regulations, particularly those governing the management or preservation of wetlands, coastal zones and threatened or endangered species, could limit our ability to develop, use, sell or rent our real property. Existing governmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations relating to climate change, air quality or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to us, which could affect the operations of our hotels and/or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend a claim, or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Additionally, because we rely on third-party managers to operate our hotel properties and certain attractions, we have limited control over ensuring compliance at those locations with applicable environmental laws or regulations or approving certain remediation action taken by the manager to resolve such issues. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act could require us to incur substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the ADA), all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADAs requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in the U.S. government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damages. Although we believe that our hotel properties substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we may be subject to audits or investigations of all of our hotels to determine our compliance, and one or more hotels may not be fully compliant with the ADA. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the incurrence of additional costs to attain compliance. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our hotel properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. If we are required to make substantial modifications to our hotel properties, whether to comply with the ADA or other changes in governmental rules and regulations, our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and amount of cash available for debt service or distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Additionally, because we rely on third-party managers to operate our hotel properties and certain attractions, we have limited control over ensuring compliance at those locations with applicable ADA requirements or approving certain remediation action taken by the manager to resolve such issues. We have invested in, and in the future may invest in, joint ventures or certain minority equity interests over which we may not have significant control, to or for which we may owe significant obligations and for which there is no readily available market, and these investments may not be profitable. We may invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, by acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. These types of investments may not be liquid and we may have little or no rights, or ability, to exercise the direction or control of the respective enterprises. In connection with these investments, we may have obligations under certain guarantees related to such investments. The ultimate value of any joint ventures or minority investments will be dependent upon the efforts of others over an extended period of time. The nature of our interests and the absence of a readily available market for those interests restrict our ability to dispose of them. Our lack of control over the management of any business in which we are a joint owner or minority investor and the lack of a readily available market to sell our interest in these businesses may cause us to recognize a loss on our investment in these businesses or to incur costs or liabilities that we do not control, but for which we may be required to contribute capital or satisfy financial commitments. These arrangements are subject to uncertainties and risks, including those related to conflicting joint venture partner interests and to our joint venture partners failing to meet their financial or other obligations. As an owner of hotel properties and operator of leisure businesses, we are subject to risks relating to acts of God, outbreaks of pandemic disease, terrorist activity and war. Our operating income and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be reduced by acts of God, outbreaks of pandemic disease, or acts of terrorism in locations where we own and/or operate significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers. Gaylord Opryland, which is located adjacent to the Cumberland River and is protected by levees built to sustain a 100-year flood, suffered flood damage on May 3, 2010 as the river rose to levels that over-topped the levees. In response to the flood, we have increased the per occurrence flood insurance limit for our Gaylord Opryland hotel to $150 million. We have also completed enhancements to the levees that protect the hotel to increase the height of the levees. While we believe these steps are reasonable given the likelihood of flood damage at Gaylord Opryland, there can be no assurances that flooding will not occur at 22 Table of Contents Gaylord Opryland in the future. In addition, in January of 2007, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that the Wolf Creek Dam on Lake Cumberland in Kentucky was at risk for structural failure. Although the Corps is taking action, including lowering the water level at Lake Cumberland and making structural repairs to the dam to reduce the chances of a dam breach, a significant portion of our Gaylord Opryland property in Nashville is in the Cumberland River flood plain and would be at risk if the dam should fail. Some types of losses, such as from flood, earthquake, terrorism and environmental hazards, may be either uninsurable, subject to sublimit, or too expensive to justify insuring against. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a hotel, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Similarly, outbreaks of pandemic disease (such as the H1N1 virus), wars (including the potential for war), terrorist activity (including threats of terrorist activity), political unrest and other forms of civil strife as well as geopolitical uncertainty, may cause our future results to differ materially from anticipated results. We are subject to risks associated with our hotel managers employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels whose managers employ unionized labor, which could increase our hotels operating costs, reduce the flexibility of our third-party hotel managers to adjust the size of the workforce at our hotel properties and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our third-party hotel managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotel properties. Although we do not employ or manage employees at our hotel properties, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, including at those of our hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes or other events. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. Furthermore, labor agreements may limit the ability of our third-party hotel managers to reduce the size of hotel workforces during an economic downturn because collective bargaining agreements are negotiated between the third-party hotel managers and labor unions. We do not have the ability to control the outcome of these negotiations. Any failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property could reduce the value of our brand names and harm our business. Third-party infringement of the Gaylord Hotels marks now owned by Marriott, or the failure to enforce rights to the marks, could be damaging to our business. The reputation and perception of our brands is critical to our success. If our trademarks or intellectual property are copied or used without authorization, the value of our brands, their reputation, our competitive advantages and our goodwill could be harmed. We regularly apply to register our trademarks in the United States. However, we cannot assure you that those trademark registrations will be granted or that the steps we take to protect our trademarks or intellectual property in the United States will be adequate to prevent others, including third parties or former employees, from copying or using our trademarks or intellectual property without authorization. Our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized use in some countries outside the United States, where local law may not adequately protect it. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. As we have in the past, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could be costly, force us to divert our resources, lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business. Any failure to maintain and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of our brands and harm our business. Hospitality companies have been the target of class actions and other lawsuits alleging violations of federal and state law and other claims, and we may be subject to legal claims. Our operating income and profits may be reduced by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our employees, customers or other third parties. In recent years, a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and other alleged violations of law. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted against us from time to time, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type or other claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, because we rely on third-party managers to operate our hotel properties and certain attractions, we have limited control over defending lawsuits of this type or other claims. 23 Table of Contents Even as a REIT, changes in federal, state, or local tax law, interpretations of existing tax law or agreements with tax authorities could affect our profitability and financial condition by increasing our tax costs. We are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application thereof, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law or interpretations and could adversely impact profitability. State and local tax authorities have increased their efforts to increase revenues through changes in tax law and audits. Such changes and proposals, if enacted, could increase our future effective income tax rates, as well as other taxes, including property taxes. Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our results of operations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Health Reform Law), was enacted. The Health Reform Law serves as the primary vehicle for comprehensive healthcare reform in the United States, including the reduction of the number of individuals in the United States without health insurance and other significant changes to the ways in which healthcare is organized, delivered and reimbursed. The complexities and ramifications of the Health Reform Law are significant and have begun being implemented through a phased approach that will conclude in 2018. Among other things, the Health Reform Law contains provisions that affect employer-sponsored health plans and impose excise and other taxes and fees with respect to certain plans. Pursuant to our management agreements, our third-party managers may pass certain health care costs for employees working at our properties through to us. As such, the provisions of the Health Reform Law may significantly raise our and our third-party managers employee health benefits costs and/or alter the benefits we or our third-party managers are required to provide to our respective employees. We continue to review provisions of the Health Reform Law and their impact on employer-sponsored plans. Costs associated with compliance with the Health Reform Law are currently difficult to estimate, but we anticipate increased expenses relating to our and our third-party managers company-sponsored plans. If we or our third-party hotel managers are not able to limit or offset future cost increases, those costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Current economic conditions may reduce demand for hotel properties and adversely affect hotel profitability. The performance of the lodging industry has historically been closely linked to the performance of the general economy and, specifically, growth in U.S. GDP. It is also sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in corporate travel budgets and consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, including, but not limited to, declines in U.S. GDP, risks affecting or reducing travel patterns, lower consumer confidence, adverse political conditions or a reduction in spending by the federal government, either resulting from sequestration or the annual budget process, can lower the revenues and profitability of our hotel properties and therefore the net operating profits of our TRS lessees to whom we lease our hotel properties. The recent global economic downturn led to a significant decline in demand for products and services provided by the lodging industry, lower occupancy levels and significantly reduced room rates. In addition, we have experienced cancellations of federal government group meetings at Gaylord National located in the Washington D.C. area and may continue to experience such cancellations at our hotel properties. We anticipate that recovery of demand for products and services provided by the lodging industry will lag improvement in economic conditions. We cannot predict how slow the global or domestic economic recovery will be or how slow the recovery in the lodging industry will be. An ongoing period of economic weakness will diminish our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our operating results and ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by various operating risks common to the lodging industry. Our hotel properties have different economic characteristics than many other real estate assets, and a hotel REIT is structured differently than many other types of REITs. A typical office property owner, for example, has long-term leases with third-party tenants, which provide a relatively stable long-term stream of revenue. Our TRS lessees, on the other hand, do not enter into a lease with a third-party hotel manager. Instead, our TRS lessees engage our third-party managers pursuant to hotel management agreements and pay the third-party hotel managers fees for managing our hotel properties. The TRS lessees receive all the operating profit or losses at our hotel properties, net of fees and reimbursements. Moreover, virtually all hotel guests stay at a hotel for only a few nights at a time, so the rate and occupancy at each of our hotel properties may change every day. As a result, we may have highly volatile earnings. 24 Table of Contents In addition, our hotel properties are subject to various operating risks common to the lodging industry, many of which are beyond our or a managers control, including the following:  competition from other hotel properties and publicly-financed civic convention centers in our markets;  over-building of hotels in our markets, which could adversely affect occupancy and revenues at our hotel properties;  dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism;  increases in energy costs and other expenses affecting travel, which may affect travel patterns and reduce the number of business and commercial travelers and tourists;  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates;  changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing;  changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;  adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions;  the impact of the use of Internet travel intermediaries by consumers;  unforeseen events beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as H1N1 influenza (swine flu), avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel-related accidents and unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes;  adverse effects of a downturn in the lodging industry; and  risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate, as discussed in more detail below. These factors could reduce the net operating profits of our TRS lessees, which in turn could adversely affect the amount of frequency of distributions we make to our stockholders and our ability to service our debt. Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our hotel properties and harm our financial condition. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more of our hotel properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:  adverse changes in international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions;  changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing;  changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;  the ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures; 25 Table of Contents  changes in operating expenses; and  civil unrest, acts of God, including earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, which may result in uninsured losses, and acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of the terrorist acts, such as those that occurred on September 11, 2001. We may decide in the future to sell one or more of our hotel properties. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a hotel property. Further, as a REIT, we are subject to a 100% excise tax on net income derived from prohibited transactions, including the sale of property (other than foreclosure property) held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course. There can be no assurances that the IRS will not contend that the sale of a hotel is subject to this 100% excise tax. We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a hotel property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a hotel, we may agree to lock-out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that hotel for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that hotel. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our hotel properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, as well as the amount of cash available for distributions to our stockholders. Our organizational documents and Delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. Our Charter and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company or our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions:  impose restrictions on transfer and ownership of our common stock that are designed to assist us in maintaining our status as a REIT;  authorize us to issue blank check preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors, without stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of common stock;  establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at meetings;  provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our chairman or by a majority of the members of our board of directors;  prohibit stockholder actions taken on written consent; and  impose restrictions on ownership of common stock by certain persons (including non-United States persons) due to our ownership of a radio station. We are subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could also delay or prevent a change of control. Together, our Charter, Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock, and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock and discourage a takeover. Our Charter permits our board of directors to issue up to 100 million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. As of the date hereof, we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any new series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue shares of preferred stock in the future that have preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights 26 Table of Contents that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction favorable to our stockholders. The ownership limitations in our Charter may restrict or prevent stockholders from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock. To qualify and remain qualified as a REIT, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include various kinds of entities) during the last half of any taxable year. To assist us in qualifying as a REIT, our Charter contains a share ownership limit. Generally, any of our shares owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the share ownership limit. This share ownership limit provides that (subject to certain exceptions) no person may beneficially own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than 9.8%, in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our capital stock, or any class or series of our capital stock. If anyone transfers shares in a manner that would violate the share ownership limit or prevent us from qualifying as a REIT, those shares instead will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and will be either redeemed by us or sold to a person whose ownership of the shares will not violate the share ownership limit or we will consider the transfer to be null and void from the outset, and the intended transferee of those shares will be deemed never to have owned the shares. Our Charter also prohibits the ownership of shares by any person or entity if such would violate or otherwise be inconsistent with federal communications laws or regulations pertaining to the ownership of television or radio stations, cable television or other radio authorizations by (i) foreign persons or entities, (ii) persons or entities having interests in television or radio broadcast stations, newspapers or cable television systems, and (iii) entities seeking direct or indirect control of us without prior federal regulatory approval. In the event of a transfer that would result in a violation or inconsistency with federal communications laws or regulations we may refuse to permit the transfer, suspend the rights of share ownership as necessary to prohibit the violation or inconsistency, or redeem the shares. Anyone who acquires shares in violation of the share ownership limit or the other restrictions on transfer in the our Charter bears the risk of suffering a financial loss when the shares are redeemed or sold if the market price of our shares falls between the date of purchase and the date of redemption or sale. In addition, these ownership limitations may prevent an acquisition of control of us by a third party without the approval of our board of directors, even if our stockholders believe the change of control is in their interest. The ability of our board of directors to change our major policies without the consent of stockholders may not be in our stockholders interest. Our board of directors determines our major policies, including any policies and guidelines we may maintain from time to time relating to our acquisitions, leverage, financing, growth, qualification as a REIT and distributions to our stockholders. Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies and guidelines from time to time without the vote or consent of our stockholders. Accordingly, our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies and those changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We may not have sufficient funds to make cash distributions to stockholders at intended payment levels, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to make distributions to our stockholders at any time in the future. As a REIT, we will generally be required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gains) each year for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, which requirement we currently intend to satisfy, and we must distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income, including capital gains, to eliminate federal corporate income tax liability. To the extent we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. 27 Table of Contents Subject to maintaining our REIT qualification, we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders, but no assurances can be made as to the amount of distributions in the future. We have also announced our intention to make distributions at specified minimum levels. Our board of directors may alter our dividend policy at any time and will have the sole discretion to determine the timing, form and amount of any distributions to our stockholders. Among the factors that could impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders are:  our inability to invest our available cash;  our inability to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns on our investments;  unanticipated expenses that reduce our cash flow or non-cash earnings;  defaults in our investment portfolio or decreases in the value of the underlying assets; and  the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. As a result, no assurance can be given that the level of any distributions we make to our stockholders in the future will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, distributions that we make to our stockholders will generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income and will generally not be eligible for reduced rates applicable to qualified dividend income. However, a portion of our distributions may be designated by us as long-term capital gains to the extent that they are attributable to capital gains income recognized by us or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that they exceed our earnings and profits as determined for tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholders investment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock may vary substantially. The trading prices of equity securities issued by REITs have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates and other factors. One of the factors that may influence the market price of our common stock is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments. An increase in market interest rates, or a decrease in our distributions to stockholders, may lead prospective purchasers of our shares to demand a higher annual yield and choose other investments, which could reduce the market price of our common stock. Other factors that could affect the market price of our common stock include the following:  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;  changes in market valuations of companies in the hotel or real estate industries;  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;  fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;  issuances of common stock or other securities in the future;  dilution or potential or perceived dilution from our convertible notes;  disputes with our hotel managers;  the addition or departure of key personnel;  announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and 28 Table of Contents  unforeseen events beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks, travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics, such as H1N1 influenza (swine flu), avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, increases in fuel prices, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel related accidents and unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes. Conversion of our 3.75% convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders, and the market price of our common stock may be impacted by note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 3.75% convertible senior notes. Our 3.75% convertible senior notes are convertible at the option of the holders during the first quarter of 2014. The notes may remain or again become convertible in other future calendar quarters if the closing market price of our common stock exceeds 120% of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period immediately prior to the beginning of such calendar quarter. Upon the conversion of our 3.75% convertible senior notes, we may elect, at our option, to deliver shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our conversion obligations. We intend to settle the face value of any notes that are converted in cash. Any shares of common stock that we elect to issue upon conversion of the notes will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders (subject to offset by the note hedge described below), and any sales in the public market of the common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The conversion rate of our 3.75% convertible senior notes will be adjusted in connection with any special or regular dividends we pay pursuant to customary anti-dilution provisions of the indenture governing the 3.75% convertible senior notes, which will result in additional shares of our common stock becoming issuable upon conversion of the 3.75% convertible senior notes. In addition, we entered into note hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the 3.75% convertible senior notes, intended to reduce potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. We also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. The number of shares covered by and the strike price of the options and warrants purchased and entered into in connection with the note hedge transactions may also be adjusted upon the payment of any special or regular dividends pursuant to customary anti-dilution provisions. In connection with establishing their initial hedge for the note hedge and warrant transactions, we believe that each of these financial institutions, or their affiliates, entered into their own various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. These financial institutions or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions during the time the 3.75% convertible senior notes are outstanding. In addition, we will exercise options we hold under the convertible note hedge transactions whenever notes are converted. To unwind its hedge positions with respect to those exercised options, we expect each of these financial institutions or its affiliates will likely sell our common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during any settlement period for converted notes. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the 3.75% convertible senior notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Based on the current market price for our common stock and the effective conversion price per share of the convertible notes, our note hedge and warrant transactions would be insufficient to prevent dilution to our stockholders if the notes are converted and we settle the face value of the notes in cash and the remainder of the value in shares of common stock. If all of the notes were converted and we settled the face value of the notes in cash and the remainder of the value in shares of our common stock, we would be obligated to issue approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock, net of the effect of our note hedge and warrant transactions, assuming a volume-weighted average trading price of our common stock of $41.78 per share for each day of the 45-day settlement period for the notes preceding the settlement date and for each of the 90 expiration dates for portions of the warrants. 29 Table of Contents Item 1B.
