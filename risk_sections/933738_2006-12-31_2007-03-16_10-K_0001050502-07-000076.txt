ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) approval unless the issuance is 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, in which case the American Stock Exchange requires stockholder approval. We may issue shares of stock in the future in connection with acquisitions or financings. In addition, we may issue options as incentives under our 1998 Incentive Option Plan or under a new equity incentive plan. Future issuances of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the ability of the board of directors to issue additional stock may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control of the Company, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESSOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
