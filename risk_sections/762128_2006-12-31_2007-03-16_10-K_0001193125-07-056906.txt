ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating BancTrusts business. The risks disclosed below, either alone or in combination, could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition or results of operations of BancTrust. Additional risks not presently known, or that are not currently deemed material, may also adversely affect BancTrusts business, financial condition or results of operations. 15 BancTrust may need to raise capital in the future when capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all. BancTrust is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. BancTrust anticipates that capital resources will satisfy these requirements in the near term. However, BancTrust may need to raise additional capital to support growth or for other needs. The ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are beyond BancTrusts control, as well as on BancTrusts current and anticipated financial performance. Accordingly, there can be no assurances as to BancTrusts ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on favorable terms or at all. In the event BancTrust is unable to raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be impeded. BancTrusts allowance for possible loan losses may not be sufficient. While BancTrust attempts to maintain diversification within its loan portfolio in order to avoid undue concentrations of credit risk, it also maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves subjectivity and requires BancTrust to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may change materially from period to period. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and beyond BancTrusts control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, BancTrusts primary regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require increases in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of BancTrust. In addition, if net charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, BancTrust will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. These types of increases in the allowance for loan losses would cause net income and perhaps capital to decline, constituting a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations of BancTrust. For a detailed discussion of BancTrusts loan loss reserve methodologies, see Allowance for Loan Losses in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Banking is a heavily regulated business. The banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law. BancTrust is subject, in certain respects, to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation and the Alabama State Banking Department. BancTrusts success depends not only on competitive factors but also on state and federal regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies. The regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, not stockholders. The ultimate effect of recent and proposed changes to the regulation of the financial institution industry cannot be predicted. Regulations now affecting us may be modified at any time, and there is no assurance that such modifications, if any, will not adversely affect BancTrusts business. BancTrusts information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security. BancTrust relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, accounting, deposit, loan and other systems. While BancTrust maintains policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of such failures, interruptions or security breaches, there can be no assurance that such an event will not occur or that if it does, it will be of such a nature that the aforementioned policies and procedures are able to effectively neutralize its potential adverse impact on BancTrust. The occurrence of failures, interruptions or security breaches of information systems could damage BancTrusts reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject BancTrust to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose BancTrust to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of BancTrust. Technology is constantly changing. The banking industry has been and remains in an environment of rapid technological changes and advancements, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Used effectively and in conjunction with sound management practices, technology can increase efficiencies and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. The future success of BancTrust depends, in part, upon its ability to effectively introduce technology-driven solutions that meet customer needs and enhance operational efficiencies. Many of BancTrusts competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. BancTrust may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the banking industry could have a material adverse impact on BancTrusts business and, therefore, its financial condition and results of operations. 16 Internal controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented. BancTrust regularly reviews and updates its financial reporting and disclosure controls, as well as policies and procedures regarding corporate governance. Any system of controls, however well designed and administered, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden. These limitations could result in misstatements due to error or fraud, which may not be detected in a timely manner. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to BancTrusts adherence to financial reporting, disclosure and corporate governance policies and procedures. Banking is heavily competitive business. Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. BancTrust competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than does BancTrust and may offer certain services that BancTrust does not or cannot provide. Additionally, some competitors are not subject to the same regulations that govern BancTrust and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. The profitability of BancTrust depends upon its continued ability to compete effectively in its various markets. BancTrusts success is heavily dependent upon local economic conditions. The success of BancTrust depends heavily on overall economic conditions in the geographic markets it serves. Local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on commercial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing them. Adverse changes in the economic conditions of the State of Alabama in general or any one or more of these local markets could negatively impact the financial results of BancTrusts operations and have a negative effect on its profitability. BancTrusts financial condition and results of operations could be significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations. BancTrusts financial condition and profitability depends significantly upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change such that the interest paid on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest earned on loans and investments. Changes in interest rates could also adversely impact the economic value of BancTrusts stockholders equity. Economic value of equity is the difference between the fair market value of assets and liabilities. See Interest Rate Risk in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Substantial sales of BancTrusts common stock could cause declines in its stock price. Should BancTrust or its stockholders sell substantial amounts of its common stock in the public market, the market price of BancTrusts common stock could fall. Such sales have the potential to make it more difficult for BancTrust to raise capital through the sale of common stock or use its common stock as currency in future acquisitions. 17 BancTrusts growth strategy contemplates merger and acquisition activity. BancTrust seeks merger or acquisition partners that possess either desirable market presence or have potential for profit growth through enhanced financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:  Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company.  Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company.  Difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company.  Potential disruption to BancTrusts business.  The possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company.  Difficulty in estimating the value of the target company.  Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company. Mergers and acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on BancTrusts financial condition and results of operations. BancTrust could issue additional securities, resulting in dilution of current ownership percentages. BancTrust may, from time to time, issue additional securities to raise capital, finance acquisitions or honor the exercise or conversion of outstanding stock options. Such issuances would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None
