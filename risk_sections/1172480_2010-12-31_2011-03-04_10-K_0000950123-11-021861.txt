Item 1A. Risk Factors Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this report as well as our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In the near-term, the success of our business will depend on many factors, including:  our ability to generate revenues from our two marketed products: Glumetza® (metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets) and Cycloset® (bromocriptine mesylate) tablets, both of which are indicated to treat type 2 diabetes;  our ability to successfully advance the development of, obtain regulatory approval for and ultimately commercialize, our development products: budesonide MMX®, Rhucin® (recombinant human C1 inhibitor), rifamycin SV MMX and SAN-300;  our ability to maintain patent protection and regulatory exclusivity for our commercial and development-stage products, including difficulty in predicting the timing and outcome of the Glumetza, Zegerid® and Zegerid OTC® patent litigation;  our ability to continue to generate revenues from our branded and authorized generic Zegerid (omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate) prescription products and the impact on our business and financial condition of the ongoing generic competition for our Zegerid products;  our ability to achieve continued progress under our strategic alliances, including our over-the-counter, or OTC, license agreement with Schering-Plough HealthCare Products, Inc., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, our license agreement with Glaxo Group Limited, an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GSK, and our license agreement with Norgine B.V., or Norgine, and the potential for early termination of, or reduced payments under, these agreements; and  the impact on our business of significant change, and the risk that we may not be successful in integrating our new marketed and development-stage products into our existing operations or in achieving the planned results from our 2010 corporate restructuring or our expanded product portfolio and pipeline. Each of these factors, as well as other factors that may impact our business, are described in more detail in the following discussion. Although the factors highlighted above are among the most significant, any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time, and you should consider all of the factors described when evaluating our business. 32 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We are dependent upon our ability to generate revenues from Glumetza and Cycloset, our only promoted commercial products, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful. Our ability to generate product revenue in the near term will depend primarily on the success of Glumetza and Cycloset. The commercial success of Glumetza and Cycloset will depend on several factors, including:  our ability to generate and increase market demand for, and sales of, Glumetza and to mitigate the impact of a prior recall and supply interruption of Glumetza 500 mg, which resulted in the unavailability of this dosage strength from June 2010 through early January 2011;  our ability to successfully generate demand for, and sales of, Cycloset, which we recently launched in November 2010 and have limited experience promoting;  the ability to maintain patent coverage for Glumetza and Cycloset, including whether a favorable outcome is obtained in the pending patent infringement lawsuit relating to Glumetza;  our ability to accurately forecast manufacturing requirements and manage inventory levels for Cycloset during the launch period and in light of the products limited expiry dating;  the performance of third-party manufacturers and our ability to maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements necessary to meet commercial demand for the products;  the occurrence of adverse side effects or inadequate therapeutic efficacy of the products, and any resulting product liability claims or additional product recalls;  the availability of adequate levels of reimbursement coverage for the products from third-party payors, particularly in light of the availability of other branded and generic competitive products; and  our ability to effectively market Glumetza and Cycloset in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In addition, in June 2010 we announced a corporate restructuring, including a substantial workforce reduction in our commercial organization. Our reduced commercial presence may not be adequate to promote both Glumetza and Cycloset. We promote the Glumetza products under a promotion agreement that we entered into with Depomed, Inc., or Depomed, and we promote the Cycloset products under a distribution and license agreement that we entered into with S2 Therapeutics, Inc., or S2, and VeroScience, LLC, or VeroScience. Our ability to successfully commercialize the Glumetza and Cycloset products is also subject to risks associated with these agreements, including the potential for termination of the agreements and our reliance on Depomed and VeroScience to maintain regulatory responsibility and patent protection for the products. We cannot be certain that our marketing of the Glumetza and Cycloset products will result in increased demand for, and sales of, those products. If we fail to successfully commercialize these products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to grow our business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Our commercialization efforts and revenues have been negatively impacted by the prior recall and supply interruption of Glumetza 500 mg. In June 2010, Depomed temporarily suspended product shipments of Glumetza 500 mg to its customers in connection with Depomeds voluntary, wholesaler-level recall of 52 lots of Glumetza 500 mg due to the presence of 33 Table of Contents trace amounts of a chemical called 2,4,6-tribromoanisole, or TBA, in bottles containing the 500 mg formulation of Glumetza. The 1000 mg formulation of Glumetza was not subject to the recall. Following implementation of various corrective actions by Depomeds supplier, Depomed resumed shipments of Glumetza 500 mg in early January 2011. This recall and supply interruption resulted in the unavailability of this dosage strength for over six months and adversely impacted our Glumetza promotion revenues in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2010. Although we have resumed the promotion and supply of Glumetza 500 mg, many of the patients who were previously prescribed Glumetza may be taking other prescription metformin products, and we may never be able to regain the lost share of the business caused by the recall. The recall illustrates our dependence upon Depomed for critical aspects of the supply of Glumetza. For example, we had limited control over the recall and resupply activities, including with respect to Depomeds interaction with the FDA, its contract manufacturer and the Glumetza wholesalers. We and Depomed may also suffer damage to our reputations and face product liability claims. Similar recall and supply interruptions may occur again in the future and may affect our Glumetza products or other products. Our development-stage products will require significant development activities and ultimately may not be approved by the FDA, and any failure or delays associated with these activities or the FDAs approval of such products would increase our costs and time to market. We will not be permitted to market budesonide MMX, Rhucin, rifamycin SV MMX and SAN-300 or any other development products for which we may acquire rights in the U.S. until we complete all necessary development activities and obtain regulatory approval from the FDA. To market a new drug in the U.S., we must submit to the FDA and obtain FDA approval of a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA. An NDA or BLA must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the applicable product candidate. The FDAs regulatory review of NDAs and BLAs is becoming increasingly focused on product safety attributes, and even if approved, development-stage products may not be approved for all indications requested and such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed, restricted distribution methods or other limitations. Failure can occur at any stage of clinical testing. The clinical study process may fail to demonstrate that our products are safe for humans or effective for their intended uses. Our clinical tests must comply with FDA and other applicable regulations, including a requirement that they be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices. We may encounter delays based on our inability to timely enroll enough patients to complete our clinical studies. We may suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies, even after showing promising results in earlier studies. Based on results at any stage of clinical studies, we may decide to discontinue development of a product candidate. We or the FDA may suspend clinical studies at any time if the patients participating in the studies are exposed to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our applications to conduct the clinical studies or in the conduct of our studies. Regulatory approval of an NDA or a BLA is difficult, time-consuming and expensive to obtain. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for NDA or BLA approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or the condition that the product candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. Despite the time and expense associated with preclinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies, CMC studies or clinical studies. The FDA and similar foreign authorities could delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including because they:  may not deem a product candidate to be adequately safe and effective;  may not find the data from preclinical studies, CMC studies and clinical studies to be sufficient to support a claim of safety and efficacy; 34 Table of Contents  may interpret data from preclinical studies, CMC studies and clinical studies significantly differently than we do;  may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities utilized for our development products;  may conclude that we have not sufficiently demonstrated long-term stability of the formulation for which we are seeking marketing approval;  may change approval policies (including with respect to our development products class of drugs) or adopt new regulations; or  may not accept a submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission. Even if we believe that data collected from our preclinical studies, CMC development program and clinical studies of our development products are promising and that our information and procedures regarding CMC are sufficient, our data may not be sufficient to support marketing approval by the FDA or any other U.S. or foreign regulatory authority, or regulatory interpretation of these data and procedures may be unfavorable. In addition, before the FDA approves one of our development products, the FDA may choose to conduct an inspection of one or more clinical or manufacturing sites. These inspections may be conducted by the FDA both at U.S. sites as well as overseas. Any restrictions on the ability of FDA investigators to travel overseas to conduct such inspections, either because of financial or other reasons including political unrest, disease outbreaks or terrorism, could delay the inspection of overseas sites and consequently delay FDA approval of our development products. Our product development costs will increase and our product revenues will be delayed if we experience delays or setbacks for any reason. In addition, such failures could cause us to abandon a product candidate entirely. If we fail to take any current or future product candidate from the development stage to market, we will have incurred significant expenses without the possibility of generating revenues, and our business will be adversely affected. To market any drugs outside of the U.S., we and current or future collaborators must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods, including obtaining reimbursement approval in select markets. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. In addition to the general development and regulatory risks described above, each of our development products is subject to the following additional risks: Budesonide MMX Budesonide MMX is being studied for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in a phase III clinical program pursuant to our strategic collaboration with Cosmo Technologies Limited, or Cosmo. We have announced statistically significant top-line results from the U.S. and European phase III clinical studies, both of which are intended to support U.S. regulatory approval. Additionally, 123 patients from the phase III studies were enrolled in a 12-month, double-blind, extended use study, the results of which the FDA requested be included in the phase III clinical program to support a U.S. regulatory submission. This extended use study is scheduled to be completed (last patient, last visit) in May 2011, with top-line data available in the second half of 2011. Although the top-line results in the U.S. and European phase III studies showed that budesonide MMX 9 mg taken once daily met the primary endpoint of superiority to placebo in achieving clinical remission as measured by the ulcerative colitis disease activity index score after eight weeks of treatment, we cannot be sure that the FDA will concur with our clinical interpretation of the results, our statistical analysis plan (including our definition of the intent-to-treat population) or the conduct of the studies. It is also possible that the extension study, which is evaluating budesonide MMX 6 mg, will not be completed in a timely or successful manner or will not provide adequate data to support approval of budesonide MMX 9 mg. Assuming successful and timely completion of the extension study, we plan to submit an NDA for budesonide MMX to the FDA by the end of 2011. However, the FDA may refuse to accept the NDA for filing. Alternatively, the FDA may accept the NDA for filing but may 35 Table of Contents ultimately conclude that we have not demonstrated sufficient safety or efficacy to approve an NDA filing for this development product or may require additional clinical studies or other development programs before approving budesonide MMX. The costs of any additional clinical studies and development programs could be significant, and we may not have sufficient resources to complete any additional development requirements in a prompt manner or at all. In addition, we anticipate that we will be filing our NDA for budesonide MMX as a section 505(b)(2) NDA, referencing pre-clinical data generated for Entocort EC (budesonide). As a result, we will be required to certify with regard to any unexpired patents listed in the Orange Book for Entocort EC that budesonide MMX does not infringe such patents or that the patents are invalid. Based on current Orange Book listings, we anticipate there will be one unexpired patent listed for Entocort EC at the time we submit our NDA for budesonide MMX. Although we believe that we have meritorious non-infringement and/or invalidity positions with regard to such patent, it is possible that following our certification, the NDA and patent holder for Entocort EC could elect to file suit against us, which in turn could result in a delay of approval for up to 30 months or longer. The outcome of any such litigation could be uncertain and defending such litigation could be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management. Additional information regarding the regulations relating to section 505(b)(2) NDAs and the certification process is set forth above under the heading Business  Government Regulation  Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. Rhucin (recombinant human C1 inhibitor) We have licensed rights to develop and commercialize Rhucin pursuant to license and supply agreements with Pharming Group NV, or Pharming. In December 2010, Pharming submitted a BLA for Rhucin to the FDA seeking approval to market Rhucin for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema, or HAE. On February 22, 2011, based on prior discussions with the FDA, Pharming announced initiation of a placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IIIb clinical study with approximately 50 patients to provide additional data in support of the 50 U/kg dose of Rhucin for the treatment of HAE. Data from the placebo-controlled study will also be used to provide prospective validation of the visual analog scale used in measuring the clinical effects of Rhucin. In addition, as currently designed, the phase IIIb clinical study includes an open-label extension to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and lack of immunogenicity of Rhucin at 50 U/kg for the repeated treatment of acute HAE attacks. As noted below, subsequent to the initiation of the phase IIIb clinical study, the FDA indicated it will provide additional comments on the studys design. On February 28, 2011, Pharming announced receipt of a refusal to file letter from the FDA for the Rhucin BLA. In the letter the FDA indicated that the BLA was not sufficiently complete to enable a critical medical review. In reaching its conclusion, the FDA indicated that the previously conducted studies evaluating Rhucin for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE did not provide data for a sufficient number of subjects to support the proposed dose of 50 U/kg and lacked prospective validation of the visual analog scale used in measuring the clinical effects of Rhucin. The FDA also provided other comments on the prior clinical studies and indicated that they will provide additional feedback on the design of the ongoing phase IIIb clinical study. In addition, the FDA requested that the results of the phase IIIb clinical study be included in any future BLA submission for Rhucin. Both we and Pharming intend to meet with the FDA at the earliest opportunity to discuss the issues raised in the FDA letter and to reach a more comprehensive understanding of what would be required for the BLA to be accepted for review. We cannot be certain that Pharming will complete the phase IIIb clinical study in a timely or successful manner or that the FDAs feedback on the design of the phase IIIb will be received in a timely manner and the extent to which such feedback may require us to modify or stop the ongoing phase IIIb study. In addition, we cannot be certain that the FDA will accept a future BLA submission for Rhucin and ultimately approve Rhucin in a timely manner or at all. The FDA may also require additional clinical studies or other development programs beyond the ongoing phase IIIb study prior to approving Rhucin. The costs of any additional clinical studies and development programs could be significant, and we and Pharming may not have sufficient resources to complete any additional development requirements in a prompt manner or at all. In addition, Pharming is planning a phase II proof of concept study to evaluate recombinant human C1 inhibitor for the treatment of early antibody mediated rejection, or AMR, in renal transplant patients. Given that this study is a proof of concept study, there is no assurance that recombinant human C1 inhibitor will be effective for this 36 Table of Contents particular indication. We cannot be certain that the clinical testing will be timely or successful, and there are many significant risks for this development program. In addition, Rhucin utilizes Pharmings transgenic technology platform for the production of recombinant human proteins, and to date there has been only one other prescription product approved by the FDA that utilizes transgenic technology. As a result, the Rhucin development product is subject to risks related to the novelty of its technology platform as well as other general development risks, any of which may result in additional costs and delays prior to our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize, Rhucin. Rifamycin SV MMX In June 2010, we initiated a phase III clinical study evaluating rifamycin SV MMX in patients with travelers diarrhea pursuant to our strategic collaboration with Cosmo, and we anticipate that we will have top-line results from this study in the first half of 2012. Our ongoing phase III clinical study is being conducted in Mexico and Guatemala, and to date, enrollment has been slower than anticipated due to a variety of circumstances, including a decrease in tourism and student travel in these countries. Cosmos European partner Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH, or Dr. Falk has initiated its phase III clinical study in October 2010. Given the delays in enrollment, among other potential risks, we cannot be certain that we and Dr. Falk will be able to complete our respective planned studies in a timely and successful manner. SAN-300 (anti-VLA-1antibody) We have acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to a humanized anti-VLA-1 monoclonal antibody, or mAb, development program, through the acquisition of Covella Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Covella, and a related license agreement with Biogen Idec MA Inc., or Biogen. SAN-300, our anti-VLA-1 mAb, is an inhibitor of VLA-1, also known as α1β1 integrin, and has shown activity in multiple preclinical models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We initially expect to develop SAN-300 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, or RA. We expect to begin a single-dose, dose-escalation phase I clinical study in March/April 2011, which study we expect would then be completed in the first half of 2012. Although SAN-300 has shown activity in pre-clinical models, it is at a very early stage of development, and has not yet been tested in any human clinical trials. As a result, we cannot be certain that the initial clinical testing and any necessary additional pre-clinical testing will be timely or successful, and there are many significant risks for this early-stage development program. Our reliance on our strategic partners, third-party clinical investigators and clinical research organizations may result in delays in completing, or a failure to complete, clinical studies or we may be unable to use the clinical data gathered if they fail to comply with our patient enrollment criteria, our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or otherwise fail to perform under our agreements with them. As an integral component of our clinical development programs, we engage clinical investigators and clinical research organizations, or CROs, to enroll patients and conduct and manage our clinical studies, including CROs located both within and outside the U.S. In addition, it is anticipated that U.S. regulatory approval for each of the budesonide MMX, Rhucin and rifamycin SV MMX development products will be supported in part by clinical studies being conducted by our strategic partners in connection with CROs or other third parties. As a result, many key aspects of this process have been and will be out of our direct control and are impacted by general conditions both within and outside the U.S. If the CROs and other third parties that we rely on for patient enrollment and other portions of our clinical studies fail to perform the clinical studies in a timely and satisfactory manner and in compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign regulations, including the FDAs regulations relating to good clinical practices, we could face significant delays in completing our clinical studies or we may be unable to rely in the future on the clinical data generated. If these CROs or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our patient enrollment criteria, our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical studies may be extended, delayed or terminated, we may be required to repeat one or more of our clinical studies and we may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products. 37 Table of Contents Due to Pars decision to launch its generic product, we expect future sales of our Zegerid brand and authorized generic prescription products to be significantly less than historical sales, which will continue to negatively impact our overall financial results. In April 2010, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled that certain patents covering our Zegerid prescription products were invalid due to obviousness. These patents were the subject of lawsuits we filed in 2007 in response to abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, filed by Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., or Par, with the FDA. In May 2010, we filed an appeal of the District Courts ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Although we intend to vigorously defend and enforce our patent rights, we are not able to predict the timing or outcome of the appeal. In late June 2010, Par commenced its commercial sale of its generic version of our Zegerid Capsules prescription product. We anticipate that Par will launch its generic version of our Zegerid Powder for Oral Suspension product once it receives FDA approval to market that product. In late June 2010, under our distribution and supply agreement with Prasco LLC, or Prasco, and as a result of Pars decision to launch its generic version of our Zegerid Capsules prescription product, Prasco commenced shipments of our authorized generic of prescription Zegerid Capsules in the U.S., and we ceased our commercial promotion of Zegerid prescription products. Under our distribution and supply agreement, Prasco pays us a specified invoice supply price and a percentage of the gross margin on sales of the authorized generic products. However, the amounts we receive from Prasco under this agreement are significantly less than the gross margin we previously recognized on sales of Zegerid prescription products. Furthermore, due to the availability of another generic product, Prascos authorized generics market share is smaller than the previous market share for our Zegerid prescription products. The launch of generic Zegerid Capsules prescription products has and will continue to adversely impact sales of our Zegerid brand prescription products and have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations, including causing a significant decrease in our revenues and cash flows. Even if physicians prescribe Zegerid products, third-party payors and pharmacists can substitute generic versions of Zegerid. In many cases, insurers and other healthcare payment organizations encourage the use of generic brands through their prescription benefits coverage and payment or reimbursement policies. Insurers and other healthcare payment organizations typically make generic alternatives more attractive to patients by providing different amounts of coverage or out-of-pocket expenses so that the net cost of the generic product to the patient is less than the net cost of the branded product. Sales of our Zegerid brand and authorized generic products may also be negatively impacted by general commercial risks, including risks relating to manufacturing and the occurrence of adverse side effects or inadequate therapeutic efficacy and any resulting product liability claims or product recalls. For example, the FDA has required proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, manufacturers to highlight the association of high-dose or long-term PPI therapy with increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine as part of the prescribing information. Our ability to generate revenues also depends on the success of our strategic alliances with Merck, GSK and Norgine. Our ability to generate revenues in the longer term will also depend on whether our strategic alliances with Merck, GSK and Norgine lead to the successful commercialization of additional omeprazole products, and we cannot be certain that we will receive any additional milestone payments or sales-based royalties from these alliances. Under these agreements, we depend on the efforts of Merck, GSK and Norgine, and we have limited control over their commercialization efforts. We are also subject to the risk of termination of each of these agreements. 38 Table of Contents We cannot be certain that these strategic partners will continue to devote significant resources to the sale or development of products under the agreements. Any determination by Merck, GSK or Norgine to cease promotion or development of products under our strategic alliances would limit our potential to receive additional payments under these agreements, and adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenues to grow our business. See also Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property for a description of the Zegerid and Zegerid OTC patent litigation and the potential impact on our strategic alliances. Our business experienced significant change in 2010, and we may not be successful in integrating our new products into our existing operations or in achieving the planned results from our corporate restructuring and expanded product portfolio and pipeline. In late June 2010, as a result of Pars decision to launch its generic version of our Zegerid Capsules prescription product, we ceased promotion of our Zegerid prescription products and announced a corporate restructuring, including a substantial workforce reduction. Shortly thereafter, in September 2010, we completed several product related transactions, including:  a distribution and license arrangement with S2 and VeroScience granting us exclusive rights to manufacture and commercialize Cycloset prescription products in the U.S.;  an exclusive license and supply arrangement with Pharming, granting us the right to commercialize Rhucin, a late-stage development product, in North America; and  an acquisition of Covella, in which we obtained the exclusive worldwide rights to SAN-300, an early-stage development product. We will need to overcome significant challenges in order to realize any benefits or synergies from these transactions. These challenges include the timely, efficient and successful execution of a number of tasks, including the following:  integrating Cycloset into our existing operations and managing the recent commercial launch of this product;  mitigating the impact of a prior recall and supply interruption of Glumetza 500 mg, which resulted in the unavailability of this dosage strength from June 2010 through early January 2011;  integrating our new development products and successfully managing the development and regulatory approval processes;  coordinating with our strategic partners and licensors concerning the development, manufacturing, regulatory and intellectual property protection strategies for these new products and development products; and  managing compliance with the in-license, acquisition, distribution, supply and other agreements associated with each of these transactions. In addition, we rely on our strategic partners and licensors for many aspects of our development and commercialization activities, and we are subject to risks related to their financial stability and solvency. We may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with these transactions. These changes will require us to expend substantial resources on the promotion of a new product and the management of development programs for additional product candidates. Even if we successfully integrate these new programs into our operations, we will be subject to the continuing risk of early termination of a number of license and similar agreements, as well as the other risks described herein. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenues from our commercial-stage products or our existing collaborations, and may be unsuccessful in raising 39 Table of Contents additional capital to continue to advance our development-stage products. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. In addition, other companies who have shifted focus to new products and additional development programs have been the target of unsolicited public proposals from activist stockholders. The public proposals can result in significant uncertainty for current and potential licensors, suppliers and other business partners, and can cause these business partners to change or terminate their business relationships with the targeted company. Companies targeted by these unsolicited proposals from activist stockholders may not be able to attract and retain key personnel as a result of the related uncertainty. Moreover, the review and consideration of an unsolicited proposal can be a significant distraction for management and employees, and may require the expenditure of significant time, costs and other resources. The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and many of our competitors have significantly more resources and experience, which may limit our commercial opportunity. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive in the markets in which our commercial products compete and development products may compete, and there are many other currently marketed products that are well-established and successful, as well as development programs underway. In addition, many of our competitors are large, well-established companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields with significantly greater expertise. Many of these companies with which we compete also have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Larger pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies typically have significantly larger field sales force organizations and invest significant amounts in advertising and marketing their products. As a result, these larger companies are able to reach a greater number of physicians and consumers and reach them more frequently than we can with our smaller sales organization. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Our Glumetza and Cycloset prescription products currently compete with many other drug products. The Glumetza prescription products compete with many other products, including:  other branded immediate-release and extended-release metformin products (such as Fortamet®, Glucophage® and Glucophage XR®);  generic immediate-release and extended-release metformin products; and  other prescription diabetes treatments. In addition, various companies are developing new products that may compete with the Glumetza products in the future. For example, Depomed has licensed rights to use its extended-release metformin technology in combination with sitagliptin, the active ingredient in Mercks Januvia® product, and with canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose transporter-2, or SGLT2, compound being developed by Janssen. The Glumetza prescription products are also the subject of a pending ANDA and related patent infringement litigation. If the litigation is resolved unfavorably to our licensor, Depomed, we may face competition from generic versions of 500 mg and 1000 mg dosage strengths of Glumetza prior to patent expiry. Like Glumetza, our Cycloset prescription product competes with many other products, including:  dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors, or DPP-4, products (such as Januvia® and Onglyza);  glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, receptor agonist products (such as Byetta® and Victoza®);  thiazolidinedione, or TZD, products (such as Avandia® and Actos®);  sulfonylureas products (such as Amaryl® and Glynase®); and  branded and generic metformin products. 40 Table of Contents In addition, various companies are developing new products that may compete with the Cycloset product in the future. For example, SGLT2 and new DPP-4 inhibitor products in development could compete with Cycloset in treating type 2 diabetes patients in the future. In addition, companies could develop combination products that include bromocriptine mesylate as one of the active ingredients for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We or our strategic partners may also face competition for our products from lower-priced products from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. Proposed federal legislative changes may expand consumers ability to import lower-priced versions of our products and competing products from Canada and other developed countries. Further, several states and local governments have implemented importation schemes for their citizens, and, in the absence of federal action to curtail such activities, we expect other states and local governments to launch importation efforts. The importation of foreign products that compete with our own products could negatively impact our business and prospects. The existence of numerous competitive products may put downward pressure on pricing and market share, which in turn may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if approved, our development-stage products will compete with many other drug and biologic products that are already entrenched in the marketplace, as well as face competition from other product candidates currently under development. We do not currently have any manufacturing facilities and instead rely on third-party manufacturers and our strategic partners for supply. We rely on third-party manufacturers and our strategic partners to provide us with an adequate and reliable supply of our products on a timely basis, and we do not currently have any of our own manufacturing or distribution facilities. Our manufacturers must comply with U.S. regulations, including the FDAs current good manufacturing practices, applicable to the manufacturing processes related to pharmaceutical products, and their facilities must be inspected and approved by the FDA and other regulatory agencies on an ongoing basis as part of their business. In addition, because several of our key manufacturers are located outside of the U.S., they must also comply with applicable foreign laws and regulations. We have limited control over our third-party manufacturers and strategic partners, including with respect to regulatory compliance and quality assurance matters. Any delay or interruption of supply related to a failure to comply with regulatory or other requirements would limit our ability to sell our products. Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in even more significant consequences, including costly recall procedures, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims. With respect to any future products under development, if the FDA finds significant issues with any of our manufacturers during the pre-approval inspection process, the approval of those products could be delayed while the manufacturer addresses the FDAs concerns, or we may be required to identify and obtain the FDAs approval of a new supplier. This could result in significant delays before manufacturing of our products can begin, which in turn would delay commercialization of our products. In addition, the importation of pharmaceutical products into the U.S. is subject to regulation by the FDA, and the FDA can refuse to allow an imported product into the U.S. if it is not satisfied that the product complies with applicable laws or regulations. In connection with the license of rights to Cycloset, we assumed a manufacturing services agreement with Patheon, Inc., or Patheon, and, accordingly, we rely on a Patheon facility located in Ohio as the sole third-party manufacturer for Cycloset. For the Glumetza products, we rely on Depomed to oversee product manufacturing and supply. In turn, Depomed relies on a Patheon facility located in Puerto Rico to manufacture Glumetza 500 mg and a Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. facility located in Canada to manufacture Glumetza 1000 mg. For our Zegerid Capsules prescription product, we currently rely on Norwich Pharmaceuticals, Inc., located in New York, as the sole third-party manufacturer of the brand and related authorized generic product. In addition, we rely on a Patheon facility located in Canada for the supply of Zegerid Powder for Oral Suspension. 41 Table of Contents For our budesonide MMX and rifamycin SV MMX development-stage products, we rely on Cosmo, located in Italy, to manufacture and supply all of our drug product requirements. For our Rhucin development-stage product, we rely on Pharming to oversee product manufacturing and supply. In turn, Pharming utilizes certain of its own facilities as well as third-party manufacturing facilities for supply, all of which are located in Europe. For our SAN-300 development-stage product, we plan to utilize clinical trial material previously manufactured by Biogen. In the future, Biogen has a right of first offer to supply our product requirements. We and our strategic partners also rely in many cases on sole source suppliers for active ingredients and other product materials and components. Any significant problem that our strategic partners or the third-party manufacturers or suppliers experience could result in a delay or interruption in the supply until the problem is cured or until we or our partners locate an alternative source of supply. In addition, because these sole source manufacturers and suppliers in many cases provide services to a number of other pharmaceutical companies, they may experience capacity constraints or choose to prioritize one or more of their other customers. Although alternative sources of supply exist, the number of third-party manufacturers with the manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities necessary to manufacture the finished forms of our pharmaceutical products or the key ingredients in our products is limited, and it would take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative manufacturers. Any new supplier of products or key ingredients would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing such products or ingredients. The FDA may require us to conduct additional clinical studies, collect stability data and provide additional information concerning any new supplier before we could distribute products from that supplier. Obtaining the necessary FDA approvals or other qualifications under applicable regulatory requirements and ensuring non-infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could result in a significant interruption of supply and could require the new supplier to bear significant additional costs which may be passed on to us. Our reporting and payment obligations under governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions, and any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. As a condition of reimbursement by various federal and state healthcare programs, we must calculate and report certain pricing information to federal and state healthcare agencies. The regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to governmental programs are complex. Our calculations and methodologies are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies, and it is possible that such reviews could result in material changes. In addition, because our processes for these calculations and the judgments involved in making these calculations involve subjective decisions and complex methodologies, these calculations are subject to the risk of errors. Any failure to comply with the government reporting and payment obligations could result in civil and/or criminal sanctions. Regulatory approval for our currently marketed products is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated. Any regulatory approval is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which our products are deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected. While physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the products labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These off-label uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice 42 Table of Contents of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to delay its approval or refuse to approve a product, the suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business. We are subject to ongoing regulatory review of our currently marketed products. Following receipt of regulatory approval, any products that we market continue to be subject to extensive regulation. These regulations impact many aspects of our operations, including the manufacture, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping related to the products. The FDA also frequently requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. For example, in connection with the approval of our NDAs for Zegerid Powder for Oral Suspension, we committed to commence clinical studies to evaluate the product in pediatric populations in 2005. We have not yet commenced any of the studies and have requested a waiver of this requirement from the FDA. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn are used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturers products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, effective in 2013. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. 43 Table of Contents If not preempted by this federal law, several states require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states prohibit providing various other marketing related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Currently, several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, as part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. This practice is regulated by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including, in particular, requirements concerning record keeping and control procedures. Any failure to comply with the regulations may result in significant criminal and civil penalties as well as damage to our credibility in the marketplace. We are subject to new legislation, regulatory proposals and managed care initiatives that may increase our costs and adversely affect our ability to market our products. In March 2010, the President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which makes extensive changes to the delivery of healthcare in the U.S. This act includes numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies, some of which are effective immediately and others of which will be taking effect over the next several years. For example, the act seeks to expand healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The act will also impose substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit, an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the U.S., increased disclosure obligations and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics. The act also contains cost-containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for healthcare items and services generally, including pharmaceuticals. It also will require reporting and public disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by pharmaceutical companies to physicians and teaching hospitals. These measures could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decreased potential returns from our development efforts. In addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the pharmaceutical industry. These include proposals to permit reimportation of pharmaceutical products from other countries and proposals concerning safety matters. For example, in an attempt to protect against counterfeiting and diversion of drugs, a bill was introduced in a previous Congress that would establish an electronic drug pedigree and track-and-trace system capable of electronically recording and authenticating every sale of a drug unit throughout the distribution chain. This bill or a similar bill may be introduced in Congress in the future. California has already enacted legislation that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. Californias electronic pedigree requirement is scheduled to take effect beginning in January 2015. Compliance with California and any future federal or state electronic pedigree requirements will likely require an increase in our operational expenses and will likely be administratively burdensome. As a result of these and other new proposals, we may determine to change our current manner of operation, provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face a risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance. Our business exposes us to potential liability risks that may arise from the clinical testing, manufacture and sale of our marketed products and development-stage products. These risks exist even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA. Any product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could significantly harm our business by, among other things, reducing demand for our products, injuring our reputation and creating significant adverse media attention and 44 Table of Contents costly litigation. Plaintiffs have received substantial damage awards in some jurisdictions against pharmaceutical companies based upon claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. Any judgment against us that is in excess of our insurance policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. Although we have product and clinical study liability insurance with a coverage limit of $15.0 million, this coverage may prove to be inadequate. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our current insurance coverage will continue to be available for our commercial or clinical study activities on reasonable terms, if at all. Further, we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which case our creditors could levy against our assets, including our intellectual property. For additional information regarding pending legal matters, please refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings. If we are unable to retain key personnel, our business will suffer. We are a small company and, as of January 31, 2011, had 223 employees. As a result of Pars decision to launch a generic version of our Zegerid Capsules prescription product, in late June 2010, we determined to cease promotion of our Zegerid prescription products, launch an authorized generic version of our Zegerid Capsules prescription product and announced a corporate restructuring, including a significant workforce reduction in our commercial organization and other selected operations. Our success depends on our continued ability to retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical, manufacturing, product development, business development and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, due to competition for personnel among pharmaceutical businesses, and the failure to do so could have a significant negative impact on our future product revenues and business results. Furthermore, any negative perceptions associated with our recent corporate restructuring may make it even more difficult for us to retain and motivate our remaining personnel, including our remaining field sales representatives. Our success also depends on a number of key senior management personnel, particularly Gerald T. Proehl, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Although we have employment agreements with our executive officers, these agreements are terminable at will at any time with or without notice and, therefore, we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain their services. In addition, although we have a key person insurance policy on Mr. Proehl, we do not have key person insurance policies on any of our other employees that would compensate us for the loss of their services. If we lose the services of one or more of these individuals, replacement could be difficult and may take an extended period of time and could impede significantly the achievement of our business objectives. Our future growth may depend on our ability to identify and in-license or acquire additional products, and if we do not successfully do so, or otherwise fail to integrate any new products into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities. We are continuing to seek to acquire or in-license products, businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our business strategy. Future in-licenses or acquisitions, however, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:  exposure to unknown liabilities;  disruption of our business and diversion of our managements time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;  a reduction of our current financial resources;  difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such acquired or in-licensed technologies;  incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions; and  higher than expected acquisition and integration costs. 45 Table of Contents We may not have sufficient resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. In particular, we may compete with larger pharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors likely will have access to greater financial resources than us and may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property The protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to our success and any failure on our part to adequately maintain such rights would materially affect our business. We regard the protection of patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own or license as critical to our success and competitive position. Laws and contractual restrictions, however, may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized use or misappropriation of our technology or deter others from independently developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. Patents Our commercial success will depend in part on the patent rights we have licensed or will license and on patent protection for our own inventions related to the products that we market and intend to market. Our success also depends on maintaining these patent rights against third-party challenges to their validity, scope or enforceability. Our patent position is subject to uncertainties similar to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, or the courts may deny, narrow or invalidate patent claims, particularly those that concern biotechnology and pharmaceutical inventions. We may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary or patent protection for our products, and protection that we have and do secure may be challenged and possibly lost. In addition, our competitors may develop products similar to ours using methods and technologies that are beyond the scope of our intellectual property rights. Other drug companies may challenge the scope, validity and enforceability of our patent claims and may be able to develop generic versions of our products if we are unable to maintain our proprietary rights. We also may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against third-party infringement, which may be difficult to detect. We have licensed the primary patent rights for each of our products and development-stage products. Although we consult with our strategic partners and licensors concerning our licensed patent rights, those partners remain primarily responsible for prosecution activities. We cannot control the amount or timing of resources that our strategic partners and licensors devote to these activities. As a result of this lack of control and general uncertainties in the patent prosecution process, we cannot be sure that any additional patents will ever be issued or that the issued patents will be properly maintained. In addition, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our licenses could be terminated and any loss of our license rights would negatively impact our ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize our products and development-stage products. Glumetza and Pending Patent Litigation We have exclusive rights to promote the Glumetza products in the U.S. under our promotion agreement with Depomed. Currently, there are four issued U.S. patents that are owned or licensed by Depomed that we believe provide coverage for the Glumetza 500 mg dose product (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,340,475; 6,635,280; 6,488,962; and 6,723,340), with expiration dates in 2016, 2020 and 2021. There are two issued U.S. patents that are owned or licensed by Depomed that we believe provide coverage for the Glumetza 1000 mg dose product (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,488,962 and 7,780,987), with expiration dates in 2020 and 2025. 46 Table of Contents Depomed, Inc.  Glumetza Patent Litigation In November 2009, Depomed filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Lupin Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary, Lupin Pharmaceutical, Inc., collectively referred to herein as Lupin, for infringement of the following patents listed in the Orange Book for Glumetza: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,340,475; 6,635,280; and 6,488,962. The lawsuit was filed in response to an ANDA and paragraph IV certification filed with the FDA by Lupin regarding Lupins intent to market generic versions of 500 mg and 1000 mg tablets for Glumetza prior to the expiration of the asserted Orange Book patents. Depomed commenced the lawsuit within the requisite 45 day time period, placing an automatic stay on the FDA from approving Lupins proposed products for 30 months or until a decision is rendered by the District Court, which is adverse to the asserted Orange Book patents, whichever may occur earlier. Absent a court decision, the 30-month stay is expected to expire in May 2012. Lupin has prepared and filed an answer in the case, principally asserting non-infringement and invalidity of the Orange Book patents, and has also filed counterclaims. Discovery is currently underway and a hearing for claim construction, or Markman hearing, was held in January 2011. Under the terms of our promotion agreement with Depomed, Depomed has assumed responsibility for managing and paying for this action, subject to certain consent rights held by us regarding any potential settlements or other similar types of dispositions. Although Depomed has indicated that it intends to vigorously defend and enforce its patent rights, we are not able to predict the timing or outcome of this action. Cycloset We have exclusive rights to manufacture and commercialize Cycloset in the U.S. under our distribution and license agreement with S2 and VeroScience. Currently, there are five issued U.S. patents that we have licensed from S2 and VeroScience that we believe provide coverage for Cycloset (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,468,755; 5,679,685; 5,716,957; 5,756,513; and 5,866,584), with expiration dates in 2012, 2014 and 2015. Budesonide MMX We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the budesonide MMX development-stage product in the U.S. under our strategic collaboration with Cosmo. Currently, there are two issued U.S. patents that are owned by Cosmo and licensed to us that we believe provide coverage for budesonide MMX (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,431,943 and 7,410,651), each of which expires in 2020. Rhucin We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the Rhucin development-stage product in the U.S., Canada and Mexico under our license and supply agreements with Pharming. Currently, there are two issued U.S. patents that are owned by Pharming and licensed to us that we believe provide coverage for Rhucin (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,067,713 and 7,544,853), which expire in 2022 and 2024. In addition, Rhucin, as a biological product, is entitled under current legislation to a period of 12 years of data exclusivity. Rifamycin SV MMX We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the rifamycin SV MMX development-stage product in the U.S. under our strategic collaboration with Cosmo. Currently, there is one issued U.S. patent that is owned by Cosmo and licensed to us that we believe provides coverage for rifamycin SV MMX (U.S. Patent No. 7,431,943), which expires in June 2020. SAN-300 We acquired worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the SAN-300 development-stage product in connection with our acquisition of Covella. Currently, there are four issued U.S. patents that are owned by Biogen and licensed to us that we believe provide coverage for SAN-300 (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,358,054; 7,462,353; 47 Table of Contents 6,955,810; and 7,723,073), which expire in 2020 and 2022. In addition, Rhucin, as a biological product, is entitled under current legislation to a period of 12 years of data exclusivity. Zegerid, Related PPI Technology and Pending Patent Litigation We have entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with the University of Missouri for patents and pending patent applications relating to specific formulations of PPIs with antacids and other buffering agents and methods of using these formulations. Currently, there are six issued U.S. patents that have provided coverage for our Zegerid products (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,840,737; 6,489,346; 6,645,988; 6,699,885; 6,780,882; and 7,399,772), all of which are subject to the University of Missouri license agreement. Five of these patents were asserted in our patent litigation against Par and were recently found to be invalid by ruling of the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, which ruling is being appealed, as further described below. In addition to the issued U.S. patent coverage described above, several international patents have been issued. Zegerid and Zegerid OTC® Patent Litigation In April 2010, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled that five patents covering Zegerid Capsules and Zegerid Powder for Oral Suspension (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,489,346; 6,645,988; 6,699,885; 6,780,882; and 7,399,772) were invalid due to obviousness. These patents were the subject of lawsuits we filed in 2007 in response to ANDAs filed by Par with the FDA. In May 2010, we filed an appeal of the District Courts ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit court has indicated oral argument will be scheduled in May 2011. Although we intend to vigorously defend and enforce our patent rights, we are not able to predict the timing or outcome of the appeal. In September 2010, Merck filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against each of Par and Perrigo Research and Development Company, or Perrigo, for infringement of the patents listed in the Orange Book for Zegerid OTC (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,489,346; 6,645,988; 6,699,885; and 7,399,772). We and the University of Missouri, licensors of the listed patents, are joined in the lawsuits as co-plaintiffs. Par and Perrigo had filed ANDAs with the FDA regarding each companys intent to market a generic version of Zegerid OTC prior to the expiration of the listed patents. The parties in each of these lawsuits have agreed to stay the court proceedings until the earlier of the outcome of the pending appeal related to the Zegerid prescription product litigation or receipt of tentative regulatory approval for the proposed generic Zegerid OTC products. We are not able to predict the timing or outcome of these lawsuits. Any adverse outcome in the litigation described above would adversely impact our Zegerid and Zegerid OTC business, including the amount of, or our ability to receive, milestone payments and royalties under our agreement with Merck. For example, the royalties payable to us under our license agreement with Merck are subject to reduction in the event it is ultimately determined by the courts (with the decision being unappealable or unappealed within the time allowed for appeal) that there is no valid claim of the licensed patents covering the manufacture, use or sale of the Zegerid OTC product and third parties have received marketing approval for, and are conducting bona fide ongoing commercial sales of, generic versions of the licensed products. The ruling may also negatively impact the patent protection for the products being commercialized pursuant to our ex-US licenses with GSK and Norgine. Although the U.S. ruling is not binding in countries outside the U.S., similar challenges to those raised in the U.S. litigation may be raised in territories outside the U.S. Regardless of how these litigation matters are ultimately resolved, the litigation has been and will continue to be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Missouri In January 2001, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with the University of Missouri for patents and pending patent applications relating to specific formulations of PPIs with antacids and other buffering agents and methods of using these formulations. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we paid the University of Missouri an upfront licensing fee of $1.0 million in 2001, a one-time $1.0 million milestone fee in 2003 following the filing of our first NDA and a one-time $5.0 million milestone fee in July 2004 following the FDAs approval of Zegerid Powder for Oral Suspension 20 mg. We are required to make additional milestone 48 Table of Contents payments to the University of Missouri upon initial commercial sale in specified territories outside the U.S., which may total up to $3.5 million in the aggregate. We are also required to make milestone payments based on first-time achievement of significant sales thresholds, up to a maximum of $86.3 million, the first of which was a one-time $2.5 million milestone payment upon initial achievement of $100.0 million in annual calendar year net product sales, which was paid to the University of Missouri in the first quarter of 2009. We are also obligated to pay royalties to the University of Missouri on net sales of our products and any products commercialized by GSK, Merck and Norgine under our existing license and distribution agreements. In addition, we are required to bear the costs of prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents, but the University of Missouri remains responsible for prosecution of any applications. Under the license agreement, we are also required to carry occurrence-based liability insurance with policy limits of at least $5.0 million per occurrence and a $10.0 million annual aggregate. The license from the University of Missouri expires in each country when the last patent for licensed technology expires in that country and the last patent application for licensed technology in that country is abandoned, provided that our obligation to pay certain minimum royalties in countries in which there are no pending patent applications or existing patents terminates on a country-by-country basis on the 15th anniversary of our first commercial sale in such country. If we fail to meet certain diligence obligations following commercialization in specified countries, the University of Missouri can terminate our license or render it non-exclusive with respect to those countries. Our rights under this license are also generally subject to early termination under specified circumstances, including our material and uncured breach or our bankruptcy or insolvency. To date, we believe we have met all of our obligations under the license. We can terminate the license at any time, in whole or in part, with 60 days written notice. Trade Secrets and Proprietary Know-how We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation in developing our products. Although we require our employees, consultants, advisors and current and prospective business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting them from disclosing or taking our proprietary information and technology, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Further, people who are not parties to confidentiality agreements may obtain access to our trade secrets or know-how. Others may independently develop similar or equivalent trade secrets or know-how. If our confidential, proprietary information is divulged to third parties, including our competitors, our competitive position in the marketplace will be harmed and our ability to successfully penetrate our target markets could be severely compromised. Trademarks The trademarks and trademark applications we own and license are important to our success and competitive position. Any objections we receive from the PTO, foreign trademark authorities or third parties relating to our registered trademarks and pending applications could require us to incur significant expense in defending the objections or establishing alternative names. There is no guarantee we will be able to secure any of our pending trademark applications with the PTO or comparable foreign authorities. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our various trademarks from infringement, any goodwill that has been developed in those marks would be lost or impaired. We could also be forced to cease using any of our trademarks that are found to infringe upon or otherwise violate the trademark or service mark rights of another company, and, as a result, we could lose all the goodwill which has been developed in those marks and could be liable for damages caused by any such infringement or violation. Third parties may choose to file patent infringement claims against us, which litigation would be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could be materially adverse to our business. The products we currently market, and those we may market in the future, may infringe patent and other rights of third parties. In addition, our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and have made significant investments in competing technologies or products, may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use and sell products either in the U.S. or international markets. Intellectual property litigation in the pharmaceutical industry is common, and we expect this to continue. 49 Table of Contents Any third party patent infringement litigation may result in a loss of rights and would be time-consuming and costly. In addition, we may be required to negotiate licenses with one or more third parties with terms that may or may not be favorable to us. Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing We may incur operating losses in the future and may not be able to return to profitability. The extent of our future operating losses and our ability to return to profitability are highly uncertain. We have been engaged in developing and commercializing drugs and have generated significant operating losses since our inception in December 1996. Our commercial activities and continued product development and clinical activities will require significant expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $125.4 million in total revenues, and, as of December 31, 2010, we had an accumulated deficit of $308.9 million. As a result of Pars decision to launch its generic version of our Zegerid Capsules prescription product, we determined in late June 2010 to cease promotion of our Zegerid prescription products and implement a corporate restructuring. As a result, we recorded significant restructuring charges relating to employment termination benefits and contract termination costs in the third quarter of 2010. In addition, we may not be able to sustain the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our restructuring, and we cannot guarantee that any of our restructuring efforts will be successful, or that we will not have to undertake additional restructuring activities. We may incur additional operating losses and capital expenditures as we support the continued marketing of the Glumetza and Cycloset products and the development of our budesonide MMX, Rhucin, rifamycin SV MMX and SAN-300 development products and any other products or development products that we acquire or in-license. Our quarterly financial results are likely to fluctuate significantly due to uncertainties about future sales levels for our currently marketed products and future costs associated with our development-stage products. Our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period, particularly because the commercial success of, and demand for, currently marketed products, as well as the success and costs of our development programs are uncertain and therefore our future prospects are uncertain. The level of our revenues and results of operations at any given time will be based primarily on the following factors:  commercial success of the Glumetza and Cycloset prescription products;  results of clinical studies and other development programs, including the ongoing and planned clinical programs for the budesonide MMX, Rhucin, rifamycin SV MMX and SAN-300 development products;  potential to receive revenue from Zegerid brand and authorized generic products;  whether we are able to maintain patent protection for our products, including whether favorable outcomes are obtained in our pending appeal relating to our Zegerid prescription products and the pending patent infringement lawsuits relating to our Glumetza prescription product and Zegerid OTC;  progress under our strategic alliances with Merck, GSK and Norgine, including the impact on these alliances from generic competition and the potential for early termination of, or reduced payments under, the related agreements;  our ability to obtain regulatory approval for Rhucin and our other development products and any future products we develop or in-license;  interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;  timing of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us, our strategic partners or our competitors; and  legislative changes, including healthcare reform, affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors. 50 Table of Contents Because of these factors, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline significantly. To the extent we need to raise additional funds in connection with the licensing or acquisition of new products or to continue our operations, we may be unable to raise capital when needed. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and use of our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next twelve months; however, our projected revenue may decrease or our expenses may increase and that would lead to our cash resources being consumed earlier than we expect. Although we do not believe that we will need to raise additional funds to finance our current operations through at least the next twelve months, we may pursue raising additional funds in connection with licensing or acquisition of new products or the continued development of our product candidates. Sources of additional funds may include funds generated through equity and/or debt financing or through strategic collaborations or licensing agreements. Our existing universal shelf registration statement, which was declared effective in December 2008, may permit us, from time to time, to offer and sell up to approximately $75.0 million of equity or debt securities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities. Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include the progress of our commercial and development activities, investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets, among others. In addition, our ability to borrow additional amounts under our loan agreement with Comerica Bank, or Comerica, depends upon a number of conditions and restrictions, and we cannot be certain that we will satisfy all borrowing conditions at a time when we desire to borrow such amounts under the loan agreement. For example, we are subject to a number of affirmative and negative covenants, each of which must be satisfied at the time of any proposed borrowing. If we have not satisfied these various conditions, or an event of default otherwise has occurred, we may be unable to borrow additional amounts under the loan agreement, and may be required to repay any amounts previously borrowed. We cannot be certain that our existing cash and marketable securities resources will be adequate to sustain our current operations. To the extent we require additional funding, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on terms acceptable to us at that time, our ability to continue our current operations or pursue new product opportunities would be significantly limited. Our current and any future indebtedness under our loan agreement with Comerica could adversely affect our financial health. Under our loan agreement with Comerica, we may incur a significant amount of indebtedness. Such indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital needs, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes;  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  make it more difficult for us to satisfy other debt obligations we may incur in the future;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; and  expose us to higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates because our indebtedness under the loan agreement with Comerica bears interest at a variable rate. 51 Table of Contents If an event of default occurs under the loan agreement, we may be unable to borrow additional amounts, and may be required to repay any amounts previously borrowed. The events of default under the loan agreement include, among other things, a material adverse effect on (i) our business operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects, (ii) our ability to repay the obligations under the loan agreement or otherwise perform our obligations under the loan agreement, or (iii) our interest in, or the value, perfection or priority of Comericas security interest in the collateral, which generally includes all of our cash and accounts receivable, but excludes intellectual property. For a description of the loan agreement, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Covenants in our loan agreement with Comerica may limit our ability to operate our business. Under our loan agreement with Comerica, we are subject to specified affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our ability: to undergo certain change of control events; to convey, sell, lease, license, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets; to create, incur, assume, guarantee or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness; to grant liens; to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments; and to make investments. In addition, under the loan agreement we are required to maintain a balance of cash with Comerica in an amount of not less than $4.0 million and to maintain any other cash balances with either Comerica or another financial institution covered by a control agreement for the benefit of Comerica. We are also subject to specified financial covenants with respect to a minimum liquidity ratio and, in specified limited circumstances, minimum EBITDA requirements, as defined in the loan agreement. Our subsidiary must also guarantee our obligations under the loan agreement, and we are required to pledge the stock of our subsidiary to the lender to secure our obligations under the loan agreement. If we default under the loan agreement because of a covenant breach or otherwise, all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable, which would negatively impact our liquidity and reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset taxes that would otherwise be due could be limited or lost entirely if we do not continue to generate taxable income in a timely manner or if we trigger an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code which, if we continue to generate taxable income, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As of December 31, 2010, we had Federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $173.3 million and $155.5 million, respectively. Our ability to use our NOLs to offset taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the NOLs, and we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be able to generate future taxable income. In addition, even if we generate taxable income, realization of our NOLs to offset taxes that would otherwise be due could be restricted by annual limitations on use of NOLs triggered by an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. An ownership change may occur when there is a 50% or greater change in total ownership of our company by one or more 5% shareholders within a three-year period. The loss of some or all of our NOLs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, California and certain states have suspended use of NOLs for certain taxable years, and other states may consider similar measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, continued suspension of our ability to use NOLs in states in which we are subject to income tax could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. Our results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn. Our results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. Continuing concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market and a difficult residential real estate market in the U.S. have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. 52 Table of Contents These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and continued unemployment concerns, have precipitated an economic recession. Domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil. These events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us. In the event of a continuing market downturn, our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may decline. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given the current instability of financial institutions, we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on these deposits. In addition, concern about the stability of markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers. In connection with the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations, we are required to make estimates and judgments which involve uncertainties, and any significant differences between our estimates and actual results could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In particular, as part of our revenue recognition policy, our estimates of product returns, rebates and chargebacks require our most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Any significant differences between our actual results and our estimates under different assumptions or conditions could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at attractive prices. The market prices for securities of specialty biopharmaceutical companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2010, the trading prices for our common stock ranged from a high of $5.67 to a low of $2.09. In addition, we have not paid cash dividends since our inception and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, our loan agreement with Comerica prohibits us from paying dividends. Therefore, investors will have to rely on appreciation in our stock price and a liquid trading market in order to achieve a gain on their investment. The trading price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially as a result of one or more of the following factors:  announcements concerning our commercial progress and activities, including sales and revenue trends for the Glumetza and Cycloset products we promote and the status of the patent litigation relating to Glumetza;  announcements concerning our product development programs, results of our clinical studies or status of our regulatory submissions;  the status of the generic versions of our Zegerid prescription products offered by Par and Prasco, and any additional generic products that may be offered in the future, as well as developments in the pending appeal relating to our Zegerid prescription products and the pending litigation concerning Zegerid OTC;  developments, including announcements concerning progress, delays or terminations, pursuant to our strategic alliances with Merck, GSK and Norgine;  other disputes or developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and trade secrets, litigation matters, and our ability to patent or otherwise protect our products and technologies; 53 Table of Contents  conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including the impact of healthcare reform and;  fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies or of the markets generally;  changes in, or our failure to meet or exceed, investors and securities analysts expectations;  announcements concerning borrowings under our loan agreement, takedowns under our existing universal shelf registration statement or other developments relating to the loan agreement, universal shelf registration statement or our other financing activities;  acquisition of products or businesses by us or our competitors;  litigation and government inquiries, including the results of a putative class action filed against us relating to alleged violations of certain labor laws seeking an unspecified amount for unpaid wages and overtime wages, liquidated and/or punitive damages, attorneys fees and other damages; or  economic and political factors, including wars, terrorism and political unrest. Our stock price could decline and our stockholders may suffer dilution in connection with future issuances of equity or debt securities. Although we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and use of our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next twelve months, we may pursue raising additional funds in connection with licensing or acquisition of new products or the continued development of our product candidates. Sources of additional funds may include funds generated through equity and/or debt financing, or through strategic collaborations or licensing agreements. To the extent we conduct substantial future offerings of equity or debt securities, such offerings could cause our stock price to decline. For example, we may issue securities under our existing universal shelf registration statement or we may pursue alternative financing arrangements. The exercise of outstanding options and warrants and future equity issuances, including future public offerings or future private placements of equity securities and any additional shares issued in connection with licenses or acquisitions, will also result in dilution to investors. The market price of our common stock could fall as a result of resales of any of these shares of common stock due to an increased number of shares available for sale in the market. Future sales of our common stock by our stockholders may depress our stock price. A concentrated number of stockholders hold significant blocks of our outstanding common stock. Sales by our current stockholders of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation that such sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, certain of our executive officers have from time to time established programmed selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for the purpose of effecting sales of common stock, and other employees and affiliates, including our directors and executive officers, may choose to establish similar plans in the future. If any of our stockholders cause securities to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. These sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital. We may become involved in securities or other class action litigation that could divert managements attention and harm our business. The stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility 54 Table of Contents in the market price of a particular companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. In December 2010, a complaint styled as a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by a person employed by us as a sales representative and on behalf of a class of similarly situated current and former employees. The complaint seeks damages for alleged violations of the New York Labor Law 650 §§ et seq. and the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. The alleged violations include failure to pay for overtime work. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid wages and overtime wages, liquidated and/or punitive damages, attorneys fees and other damages. We deny all claims asserted in the complaint. Over the last few years, similar class action lawsuits have been filed against other pharmaceutical companies alleging that the companies sales representatives have been misclassified as exempt employees under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and applicable state laws. There have been varying outcomes in these cases to date, and it is too early to predict an outcome in our matter at this time. Although we intend to vigorously defend against the litigation filed against us, litigation often is expensive and diverts managements attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business regardless of the outcome. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could adversely affect our stock price and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. These provisions include:  dividing our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;  prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;  permitting the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval;  prohibiting our stockholders from making certain changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws except with 66 2/3% stockholder approval; and  requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at stockholders meetings. We are also subject to provisions of the Delaware corporation law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for five years unless the holders acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors. Together, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. In addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan. Although the rights plan will not prevent a takeover, it is intended to encourage anyone seeking to acquire our company to negotiate with our board prior to attempting a takeover by potentially significantly diluting an acquirers ownership interest in our outstanding capital stock. The existence of the rights plan may also discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. Item 1B.
