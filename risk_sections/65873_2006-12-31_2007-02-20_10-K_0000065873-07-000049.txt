Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) Rapid and significant changes in technology could require Alltel to significantly increase capital investment or could result in reduced demand for its services. Technologies for wireless communications are rapidly changing. In the majority of Alltel’s wireless markets, it employs CDMA, which is a second-generation digital technology providing expanded channel capacity and the ability to offer advanced services and functionality. Alltel is currently deploying CDMA 2000, 1XRTT and EV-DO technologies, which are third-generation technologies that increase voice capacity, allow high-speed data services and are capable of addressing more complex data applications. Deployment of third-generation digital technologies will require Alltel to make additional capital investments. CDMA-based technologies currently serve less than 20 percent of the wireless users worldwide, with Global System for Mobil Communications, or GSM-based technologies being the predominant technology globally. The GSM operators are deploying Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, or UMTS, technology as they migrate to third-generation networks. If the global market for CDMA-based technologies decreases further and leads to either higher prices or lower availability of infrastructure equipment or handsets supporting CDMA-based technologies, Alltel could be forced to migrate to either GSM- or UMTS-based technologies to remain competitive. This would require Alltel to make extensive capital investments and potentially incur asset write-downs, which could adversely affect the Company’s future results of operations and cash flows.
