ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Business In addition to the risks referenced in Note on Forward Looking Statements included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operation herein and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are a number of risk factors which could impact our performance, including those listed below. We have a limited operating and financial history, and our historical financial results may not accurately or reliably predict our future performance. We were formed in March 2003 as an underwriting manager for the Capitol Companies pending the establishment or acquisition of a separate insurance carrier for Darwin business. In May 2004, we acquired DNA, an admitted insurance company. In May 2005, we acquired Darwin Select, a surplus lines insurance company. We therefore have limited operating and financial history available upon which to evaluate our past performance. In addition, because we focus our efforts on certain specialized sectors of the insurance market, and because we do not have an extensive claims history to date, our historical financial results may not accurately predict our future performance. Moreover, companies in their initial stages of development present substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses. A decline in our financial strength ratings could cause us to lose substantially all of our business. Best currently rates DNA at A− (Excellent) and Darwin Select at A− (Excellent) (reinsured rating). A rating of A− (Excellent) is the fourth highest of 16 separate Best rating categories that currently range from A++ (Superior) to F (Liquidation). Our insurance company subsidiaries ratings are subject to periodic review, and may be revised downward or revoked at any time at Bests sole discretion. A downgrade could cause our current and future distribution partners (brokers, agents and licensed insurance agents who are delegated authority to manage part of our insurance business, whom we refer to as program administrators) and insureds to choose other, more highly rated competitors and could also increase the cost or reduce the availability of reinsurance to us. As a result, a downgrade in our ratings could cause a substantial reduction in the number of policies we write which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, a downgrade of our ratings could adversely impact our ability to attract investment capital on favorable terms. We do not have employment agreements or non-competition agreements with most of our key management personnel, and if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered. Our success depends, in part, upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel, including Stephen Sills, our President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mr. Sills or any of our other key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our key management personnel other than Mr. Sills and Mark I. Rosen, our Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Our executive officers and key personnel, other than Mr. Sills and Mr. Rosen, are not subject to non-competition agreements. Our employment agreement with Mr. Sills provides that he has the right to terminate his agreement for any reason. Mr. Sills agreement provides that he can terminate for good reason under certain circumstances, for which he would be entitled to receive certain payments and benefits upon termination. We could be materially adversely affected by the termination of Mr. Sills employment as our President and Chief Executive Officer. 32 Table of Contents We do not have key person insurance on the life of Mr. Sills or on the lives of any of our other key management personnel. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, but our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations, prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. If we are unable to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In the insurance business the product is priced and sold before the underlying costs are known. This requires significant reliance on estimates and assumptions in setting prices. Rate adequacy is necessary, together with investment income, to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, LAE and other underwriting expenses (which include the aggregate of policy acquisition costs, including commissions, and the portion of administrative, general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations) and to earn a profit. If we fail to assess accurately the risks we assume, we may fail to charge adequate premium rates, which could reduce income and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In order to price accurately, we must collect and analyze a substantial volume of data; test and apply appropriate rating formulae; monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. We must also implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully, and as a result price accurately, is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: availability of sufficient reliable data; incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data; uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally; selection and implementation of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies; ability to predict investment yields and the duration of our liability for losses and LAE accurately; and unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action. Our actual incurred losses and LAE may be greater than our loss and LAE reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are liable for incurred losses and LAE under the terms of the insurance policies we underwrite. In many cases, several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss event, the making of a claim, and our resolution of that claim. We establish loss and LAE reserves for the estimated ultimate payment of all losses and LAE incurred. We estimate loss and LAE reserves using individual case-basis valuations of reported claims. We also use statistical analyses to estimate the cost of losses that have been incurred but not reported to us. These estimates are based on historical information and on estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency of claims and changes in the average cost of claims that may arise in the future. They are by their nature imprecise, and our ultimate losses and LAE may vary from established reserves. In addition, our business consists of low frequency, high severity claims experience which also makes precise estimation more difficult. Because of our relatively short operating history, we have less claims experience than do other carriers on which to base reserves. Consequently, the techniques that we currently utilize to establish our loss and LAE reserves primarily take into account relevant insurance industry data. If our loss and LAE reserves should prove to be inadequate, we will be required to increase reserves, thereby reducing net earnings and stockholders equity in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Future loss experience, if substantially in excess of established reserves, could also have a material adverse effect on future earnings and liquidity and our financial position. Furthermore, factors that are difficult to predict may impact future loss and LAE, such as claims inflation, claims development patterns, legislative activity, social and economic patterns and litigation and regulatory trends. We currently rely on certain Alleghany subsidiaries to write some of the insurance policies that we produce, and a termination of our arrangements with them could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have underwriting management agreements with each of the Capitol Companies to write policies produced by DPUI. Initially, all business produced by DPUI was written on policies of the Capitol Companies. Since each of DNA and Darwin Select obtained its own Best rating of A− (Excellent) in November 2005, whenever possible, DPUI has written coverage on policies issued by DNA or Darwin Select. However, DNA does not yet have in place 33 Table of Contents all rate and form filings required to write insurance business in every jurisdiction where it is licensed. In addition, the Capitol Companies have Best ratings of A (Excellent), and we believe that insureds in certain classes of our business (primarily public company D&O) require policies issued by an insurer with an Best rating of A (Excellent). Consequently, although an increasing percentage of our business is written on policies of our own subsidiaries, we continue to depend upon the Capitol Companies to write policies for a portion of the business produced by DPUI. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we wrote gross premiums of $42.9 million (15.3% of our total gross premium written) through the Capitol Companies arrangement, and of that amount, $29.6 million related to business where our insured required a policy from a Best A rated carrier. We do not expect that our policies written on the Capitol Companies for the insureds who require a Best rating of A (Excellent) will decline so long as our rating is A− (Excellent). Most of the insureds in this category are public companies purchasing D&O insurance. While our public D&O writings have declined as a percentage of our total writings, we will continue to have a need to utilize the policies of the Capitol Companies in the future. The terms and conditions of our underwriting agreements with the Capitol Companies are discussed elsewhere in this Report (see Business  Arrangements with the Capitol Companies above.) We could be materially and adversely affected if such agreements were terminated at a time when we still depended on the Capitol Companies to write a material portion of the business produced by DPUI, or if the Capitol Companies were downgraded from their current Best ratings of A (Excellent). There is no guaranty that we would be able to locate other entities to write such business and to negotiate new agreements with such other entities (which new agreements might involve additional expense to us). If we are not able to renew our existing reinsurance or obtain new reinsurance or if we were to increase our retention levels in premiums written, either our net exposures would increase or we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitment, both of which could increase the volatility of our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations. We purchase reinsurance, primarily excess of loss reinsurance, to spread their risk on substantially all of our lines of business. (See Business  Ceded Reinsurance above.) Volatile reinsurance market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection that we purchase. Consequently, we must evaluate our use of reinsurance and assess whether to increase, decrease or eliminate the amount of liability we cede to reinsurers, depending upon cost and availability. If we were to increase the levels of risk we retain, our net exposures would increase and this could cause our earnings and results of operations to be more volatile. Our reinsurance facilities generally are subject to annual renewal, and there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or that we will be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to make new arrangements, or if the cost of reinsurance increased to an amount we were unwilling to pay, our net exposure would increase, which would cause our earnings and results of operations to be more volatile. If we were unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, which would reduce our revenues. If our reinsurers do not pay claims made by us in a timely fashion, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us (the reinsured) of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis, or they may not pay some or all of our claims. Either event would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our reinsurance contracts did not pass the transfer of risk provisions of FAS 113, we would be required to restate our financial results. Evaluating risk transfer involves significant assumptions relating to the amount and timing of expected cash flows, as well as interpretations of underlying contract terms, to determine if contracts meet the conditions 34 Table of Contents established by SFAS No. 113. These tests include a number of subjective judgments. Because of this subjectivity and in the context of evolving practices and application of existing and future standards, we could be required in the future to adjust our accounting treatment of these transactions. This could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If our relationship with one of our larger distribution partners were terminated, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As discussed above (see Business  Marketing and Distribution above), we distribute our products through a select group of distribution partners, including brokers, agents and program administrators. For the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately 27.2% of our gross premiums written was produced by two of our distribution partners: American Professional Agency (a program administrator) and Marsh Inc. Our program administration agreements are terminable upon 180 days notice. We do not have exclusive arrangements with our brokers and agents, and they can terminate our relationship at any time. Thus, we cannot be sure that relationships with our distribution partners will continue. The termination of a relationship with one or more of these producers could result in lower gross premiums written and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If a program administrator were to exceed its underwriting authority or otherwise breach obligations owed to us, we could be materially adversely affected. In the programs currently in place, we authorize the program administrators to write business on our behalf within underwriting guidelines that we prescribe. In this structure, we rely on the underwriting controls of our program administrators to write business within the underwriting guidelines that we prescribe. Although we monitor our programs on an ongoing basis, our monitoring efforts may not be adequate or our program administrators may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us. We are liable to policyholders under the terms of policies underwritten by our program administrators and, to the extent that our program administrators exceed underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We rely heavily on our information technology and telecommunication systems, both generally and in connection with i-bind; failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business. Our business is more highly dependent than many others on successful, uninterrupted functioning of our information technology (IT) and telecommunications systems. In addition to supporting our proprietary i-bind online submission platform, we rely on our IT systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations. These systems also enable us to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting and rate development. A failure of these systems or the termination of a third-party software license upon which any of these systems are based could materially impact our ability to evaluate and write new business. If we do not maintain adequate IT and telecommunications systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including: inadequate information on which to base critical decisions; loss of existing customers; difficulty in attracting new distribution partners or disputes with our present distribution partners; regulatory problems, such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; litigation exposure; and increased administrative expenses. Thus, our failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our investment results and, therefore, financial condition and results of operations, may be materially adversely impacted by changes in the business, financial condition or operating results of the entities in which we invest, as well as changes in interest rates, government monetary policies, general economic conditions and overall capital market conditions. Our results of operations depend, in part, on the performance of our invested assets. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the fair value of, our investments in fixed-income securities. As a result, interest rate fluctuations could impact our net income. Substantially all of our fixed-income securities are classified as available 35 Table of Contents for sale, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and increase or decrease our stockholders equity. In addition, issuers of the fixed-income securities that we own may default on principal and interest payments, as a result of economic downturn, events of corporate malfeasance or other factors which would cause a decline in the value of our fixed-income portfolio and cause our net earnings to decline through lost investment income and credit write-down of principal. Our fixed-income investment portfolio includes mortgage-backed securities. The fair value of these securities fluctuates with the market, and in addition changes in interest rates expose these securities to prepayment risk. That is, in periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments (generally from refinancings) increase and the securities are paid down more quickly, requiring us, as the investor, to reinvest repayments at the then lower market rates. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, prepayments generally slow. Mortgage/asset-backed securities that have an amortized cost that is less than par (i.e. purchased at a discount) may incur a decrease in yield as a result of a slower rate of prepayment. Certain asset-backed and municipal securities held by Darwin are backed by a financial guarantee insurance policy from a mono-line insurance guarantor (mono-lines) to strengthen the overall credit quality of the security. These mono-lines have historically been rated at the highest credit quality ratings from the major rating agencies (Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch). Recent volatility in the credit market, particularly related to the sub-prime credit market, has caused large losses for these mono-lines, reduced their capital and put their credit ratings at risk. Several have been downgraded and/or are on a negative credit watch by the major rating agencies. When a security is backed by a mono-line insurance company guarantee, and that mono-line has a credit rating higher than the underlying credit rating of the issuer, it may trade at a price higher than it would if there was no guarantee. When acquiring fixed income securities that are backed by a financial guarantee insurance policy, Darwins investment philosophy is to evaluate the credit quality of the underlying issuer assuming that no insurance guarantee is in place and purchase those securities based upon the assumption that no insurance policy would be available to make payment on the securities. A subsequent downgrade of that mono-line insurance carriers credit rating could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of the securities that are backed by that mono-line carriers insurance guarantee. The Company has recently completed a search for an equity investment manager and has begun investing in equity securities with the goal of investing approximately 10% of our investment portfolio in this class over time. The performance of an equity portfolio depends on a number of factors, including many of the same that affect the performance of fixed-income securities (although those factors can have the opposite effect on the market prices of equity securities. The equity markets as a whole have been relatively volatile in recent years, and we will need to exercise care in selecting equity securities for investment, and our equity investments may be negatively affected by market conditions outside our control. If we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it appropriately matches our insurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such liabilities. In addition, if we do not succeed in targeting an appropriate overall risk level for our investment portfolio, the return on our investments may be insufficient to meet our long-term profit targets. As a holding company and underwriting manager, we are dependent on the results of operations of our insurance company subsidiaries, and we rely upon the regulatory and financial capacity of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts could harm our ability to meet our obligations. As an insurance holding company without significant operations of our own (other than our underwriting manager business), payments from our subsidiaries under our underwriting management and tax sharing agreements are currently our sole sources of funds to pay holding company expenses. We anticipate that such payments, together with dividends paid by subsidiaries, will be the primary source of funds for our holding company. State insurance laws restrict the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to declare stockholder dividends. State insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus. (See Business  Regulation, Payment of Dividends above.) In addition, insurance regulators can block payments to us from our insurance company subsidiaries that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval if the regulators determine that the payments (such as payments under tax sharing agreements or payments 36 Table of Contents for employee or other services) would be adverse to the interests of policyholders or creditors. As a result, we may not be able to receive dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to pay corporate expenses or meet other obligations. If the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, it could adversely affect our ability to pay our corporate expenses. If we are unable to raise additional capital in the future, whether on favorable terms or at all, we may not have sufficient funds to implement our operating plans, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We have in place a $25 million credit facility with a consortium of lending institutions led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., extending until March 2010, under which there was approximately $20 million of borrowing capacity at December 31, 2007. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that such credit availability, together with payments under our tax sharing agreements and such dividends as we are permitted by regulators to receive from our subsidiaries will support operations for the foreseeable future without the need for additional capital. However many factors will affect our capital needs and their amount and timing. Such factors include: our growth and profitability; claims experience and the availability of reinsurance; and possible acquisition opportunities, market disruptions and other unforeseeable developments. If we have to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on unfavorable terms and may, in an equity financing, dilute our stockholders interests. In any case, such securities may confer rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the common stock shares or may impose covenants that impair our operations. Litigation and legal proceedings against our insurance company subsidiaries could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to routine legal proceedings in the normal course of operating our business, including litigation regarding claims, and we expect to continue to be subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently involved in any legal proceeding that we believe could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if such litigation were to develop, adverse judgments in one or more of such lawsuits could require us to pay significant damage amounts or to change aspects of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we acquire other insurance businesses and are unable to integrate them successfully with our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As noted elsewhere in this Report (see Business  Evolution and Subsidiaries) we acquired AMS, a group of Florida-based insurance distribution corporations, in early 2008. We do not currently have plans to acquire any other insurance business. However, we believe we will be presented from time to time with acquisition opportunities which would allow us to grow our business while achieving our profitability goals. Therefore, if we are presented with an appropriate opportunity, we may pursue acquisition of one or more specialty insurance businesses or books of business. Some of these acquisitions could be material in size and scope. If a potential acquisition opportunity is identified, there can be no assurance that we will consummate such acquisition. If any such acquisition does occur it may not be successful in enhancing our business, may not be accretive to earnings or book value or may not generate an underwriting profit. In addition, to the extent that we do acquire new businesses, such acquisitions could pose a number of special risks, including the diversion of managements attention, the unsuccessful integration of the acquired operations and personnel, adverse short-term effects on reported operating results, impairment of acquired intangible assets and the loss of key employees. We may, in the future, issue additional common stock in connection with one or more acquisitions, which may dilute our stockholders. Alternatively, we may incur debt, which could limit our future financial flexibility. Additionally, with respect to future acquisitions, our stockholders may not have an opportunity to review the financial statements of the entity being acquired or to vote on such acquisitions. 37 Table of Contents Our capital adequacy requirements could negatively affect our return on equity for a long time. In addition, if we are unable to grow into our capital base as quickly as we anticipate, our return on equity could be negatively affected. We need to satisfy certain capital requirements in order to maintain our A.M. Best ratings. We are also subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by insurance regulators. These requirements may lead us to maintain a higher level of capital in our insurance company subsidiaries than we otherwise would, which could hold down our return on equity. Either capitalization requirement could persist for a relatively long period, meaning that our return on equity would be decreased for a number of years into the future. Risks Related to Our Industry Our business is cyclical in nature, which may affect our financial performance. The insurance business historically has been a cyclical industry, with periods of intense price competition and broad coverage terms (referred to as soft market conditions), and other periods when insuring capacity is tight, resulting in high premium levels and restrictive coverage terms (hard markets). An increase in the supply of risk-bearing capacity, due either to new entrants bringing in new capital or to additional capital being contributed by existing insurers, causes less favorable pricing and policy terms and may decrease demand for our underwriting services. Additionally, periodic changes in loss frequency and severity within a particular insurance line will impact the cycle of the insurance business significantly. Our returns will generally be impacted by the cyclical nature of the industry. Though each of our lines and classes is cyclical, each is subject to its own insurance cycle and the prevailing conditions in one class may or may not be reflective of conditions in another. While difficult to generalize, we believe markets for the E&O and Medical Malpractice Liability lines have become more competitive during the past several years, and as a result, virtually all of our major business lines are experiencing soft or highly competitive market conditions. We endeavor to target market segments where conditions are favorable to insurers, but downturns in market conditions could affect our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we were unable to write our specialty lines of insurance at appropriate rates, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, which would reduce our revenues. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have, or have more market recognition than we do, and, we may not be successful in competing effectively with them. We compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we have and may also have lower total expense ratios, allowing them to price their products more competitively than we can. In addition, some of our competitors operate from tax-advantaged jurisdictions and have the ability to offer lower rates due to such tax advantages. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate or to expand our operations into new markets, our underwriting revenues and net income may grow more slowly than expected or may decline. Competition is based on many factors, including: perceived market strength of the insurer; pricing and other terms and conditions; services provided; speed of claims payment; reputation and experience of the key management and underwriting staff; and ratings assigned by independent rating organizations such as Best. A number of potential new developments could further increase competition in our industry. These developments could include, for example, an increase in capital-raising by companies in our lines of business, which could result in new entrants to our markets and an excess of capital in the industry. Competition from new entrants or increased competition from our existing competitors could affect our ability to price our products at rates that are likely to generate underwriting profits. 38 Table of Contents We are subject to extensive regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if we fail to comply with regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, primarily by DNAs state of domicile Delaware, and Darwin Selects state of domicile Arkansas. To a lesser extent, our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to regulation in the other states where they operate. Significant changes the laws and regulations of these states could further limit our discretion or make it more expensive to conduct our business. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may impose timing and expense constraints that could adversely affect our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. In addition, regulatory authorities have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, where there is uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe to be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Further, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could interfere with our operations and require us to bear additional costs of compliance, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of our liability may not be known for years after a contract is issued. Recent liabilities related to options award practices and to sub-prime lending and collateralized debt obligations are examples of claims and coverage issues that can emerge from time to time. Another recent example of an emerging claims and coverage trend is the larger amount of settlements and jury awards against professionals and corporate directors and officers covered by professional liability and directors and officers liability insurance. The effects of claims and coverage trends are extremely hard to quantify or predict and could harm our results of operations. The passage of tort reform and the subsequent review of such laws by the courts could have a material impact on our operations. Tort reform generally refers to laws restricting a plaintiffs ability to recover damages by imposing one or more limitations, including: eliminating certain claims that can be heard in a court, limiting the amounts or types of damages; reducing statutes of limitation; or limiting venue or court selection. Certain states in which we do business have enacted, or are considering, tort reform legislation. However, many reform laws are being challenged in state courts, and there is no assurance that they will ultimately be upheld. While the effects of tort reform would appear beneficial to our business generally, there can be no assurance that such reforms will be effective. If tort reforms are effective, providing professional and other liability insurance may become more attractive, thereby causing an increase in competition for our business. In addition, there is no assurance that the benefits of tort reform will not be accompanied by regulatory actions that may be detrimental to our business such as expanded coverage requirements and premium rate limitations or rollback of premiums charged. 39 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Alleghany and the ownership of our shares is highly concentrated. A future sale of all or a substantial portion of Alleghanys shares of our common stock, or the possibility of such future sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Alleghany and our management stockholders beneficially own approximately 65% of our outstanding common stock. At the time of our IPO in May 2006, Alleghany was granted the right under a Registration Rights Agreement to require us to register some or all of the Alleghany shares for sale under the U.S. securities laws. In August 2007 we registered all of Alleghanys 9,371,096 shares of Common Stock in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement. As of the date hereof, Alleghany has not sold any shares of Common Stock under the August 2007 Registration Statement, but it may decide to sell some or all of the registered shares at any time in its sole discretion. Alleghanys sale of Common Stock could have an adverse effect on our stock price. We cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of shares by Alleghany or others, or the availability of shares for future sale, may have on the prevailing market price of our Common Stock. If such sales, or the possibility of such sales, reduce the market price of our Common Stock, our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets may be adversely affected. Alleghany has significant control over us and may not always exercise its control in a way that benefits the other security holders. Also, conflicts of interest that may arise between us and Alleghany could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us. As our majority stockholder, Alleghany has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the power to affect the election of our directors, appointment of our management, our dividend policy and the approval of any action requiring a stockholder vote, such as amendments to our certificate of incorporation, transactions with affiliates, mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets. Because Alleghanys interests may differ from the interests of our other security holders, actions Alleghany takes with respect to us, as our controlling stockholder, may not be favorable to such other investors. Additionally, questions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between us and Alleghany from time to time. One of our directors is an officer and director of Alleghany, and two other of our directors are also officers of Alleghany. Ownership interests of our directors in Alleghany shares, or service as a director or officer of both our company and Alleghany, could give rise to potential conflicts of interest when a director or officer is faced with a decision that could have different implications for the two companies. These potential conflicts could arise, for example, over matters such as the desirability of an acquisition opportunity, employee retention or recruiting, or our dividend policy. The corporate opportunity policy set forth in our certificate of incorporation addresses potential conflicts of interest between Darwin, on the one hand, and Alleghany and its officers and directors who are directors of the Company, on the other hand. It provides that, subject to any written agreement to the contrary, Alleghany has no legal duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as we do, or from doing business with any of our clients, customers or vendors. The policy also provides that if Alleghany acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and Alleghany, or a person who is an affiliate of Alleghany, then unless the corporate opportunity was expressly offered to Alleghany in its capacity as a stockholder of Darwin, the corporate opportunity will be deemed to be renounced by us such that we waive any claim that the corporate opportunity should have been presented to us, and Alleghany will have no duty to communicate or present that corporate opportunity to us. The policy further provides that if one of our directors or officers who is also a director, officer, employee or agent of Alleghany learns of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both us and Alleghany, or a person who is an affiliate of Alleghany, then unless the corporate opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer, the corporate opportunity will be deemed to be renounced by us such that we waive any claim that the corporate opportunity should have been presented to us, and such director or officer will have no duty to communicate or present that corporate opportunity to us. 40 Table of Contents If a conflict of interest arises between us and Alleghany, the corporate opportunity policy set forth in our certificate of incorporation may result in a conflict resolution that would be unfavorable to us. Because Alleghany, through certain of its insurance company subsidiaries, engages in some of the same lines of specialty insurance that we write, our ability to successfully operate and expand our business may be adversely affected. Alleghany has no obligation to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us, or doing business with, or in competition with, any of our clients, customers or vendors. Some of Alleghanys insurance company subsidiaries compete with us in some of the same lines of specialty insurance that we write. Because of Alleghanys significant financial resources, Alleghany could have a significant competitive advantage over us should it decide to expand its business in any of the specialty insurance lines that we write. We are a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE rules and qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, our stockholders are not afforded all of the same protections as stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the Exchange. A company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. As a controlled company (because Alleghany holds more than 50% of the voting power of DPUI), we rely upon the controlled company exemptions of the NYSE corporate governance standards. These exemptions free us from the obligation to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors; that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee consisting entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities; and that we have a compensation committee consisting entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. ITEM 1B.
