ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following risks and uncertainties could affect our future results of operations, financial condition and the market value of our common stock. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TIMELY SECURE CONTRACTS WITH CITIES OR RELATED GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND MANAGE NEW MULTIPURPOSE FACILITIES AND ADJACENT REAL ESTATE, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We depend on contracts with cities or related governmental entities to design, develop, and manage new multipurpose facilities and adjacent real estate. Typically we must expend 20-30 months of effort to obtain such contracts. We depend on these contracts for the revenue they generate and the facilities resulting from these contracts are potential facilities in which our licensees may operate. Failure to timely secure these contracts may negatively impact our results. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE NEW LICENSEES WILLING AND ABLE TO PAY INITIAL LICENSE FEES AND COMMENCE, AND SUSTAIN OPERATIONS, WHICH MAY MEAN WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THE CRITICAL NUMBER OF LICENSEES REQUIRED FOR PROFITABILITY. Purchasing a license requires significant capital and commencing operation is a significant expense which limits the pool of potential licensees We depend on a critical mass of licensees to capture the economies of scale inherent in the League's operations and to facilitate intra-league play. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract qualified candidates for licenses. We anticipate that expansion of the League will be difficult because of the high capital costs of licenses, competitive pressures from sports leagues and entertainment providers both within and outside of the markets where we currently operate, and the lack of arenas for new licensees. The minor league hockey industry in which we conduct business is unproven and subject to significant competition from other sports and entertainment alternatives as well as both the National Hockey League and its minor league hockey system, the American Hockey League, and other independent minor hockey leagues. Even teams of the National Hockey League, which is the largest professional hockey league with the greatest attendance, have struggled to remain financially viable. A significant portion of our revenues result from payments made by licensees. There can be no assurance that licensees will not default under their license agreements. If the League is unable to attract new licensees, or if existing licensees are not able to make the continuing payments required by their license agreements, we may not be able to survive. There can be no assurance that any payments will be made by new or current licensees. IF OUR LICENSEE'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH PLAYERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, THE LICENSEES MAY BE FACED WITH LABOR DISRUPTIONS OR STOPPAGES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The players in the League, employees of the licensees, will be represented by the Professional Hockey Players Association in the 2008-2009 seasons. A collective bargaining agreement has yet to be negotiated. The League and licensees may be regularly subject to grievances, arbitration proceedings and other claims concerning alleged past and current non-compliance with applicable labor law and collective bargaining agreements. These matters, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our licensees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES IN CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE FUTURE RESULTS. Our history of losses in certain subsidiaries makes it difficult to assess our future results of operations and to determine if we will ultimately succeed or remain profitable. There are many events and factors that could materially and adversely affect us, over some of which we have limited or no control, including: * the inability to obtain capital at times and in amounts necessary to support our operations and intended growth; 12 * the inability to develop and expand our design, management and construction business; * the inability to attract and retain licensees for the minor professional hockey league we operate and manage; * the inability of minor professional hockey league licensees to attract and retain the interest of the public in the markets served by the licensees; * competition from other hockey leagues; * competition from alternative forms of sports and entertainment outside the hockey industry; and * the inability to develop and grow a customer base for our ticketing and facility management services. There can be no assurance that we will remain viable or that we will continue our operations for any length of time. WE INTEND TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND MAY NOT SURVIVE IF THIS STRATEGY IS UNSUCCESSFUL. We intend to expand the number of professional minor league hockey licensees and increase the number of arenas we develop and manage. There can be no assurance that we will have available sources of funds or personnel necessary to achieve rapid or sustained growth or that we will succeed in identifying and securing desirable licensees and markets for expansion of the League or new facilities and business opportunities available to expand our business. Even if we are able to expand our business and operations, we may not be able to manage this growth successfully. Any successful growth will require us to continue to implement and improve our financial, accounting, and management information systems and to hire, train, motivate, and manage additional employees. A failure to manage growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and on our ability to execute our business strategy successfully. WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUES AS WELL AS A GROWING NUMBER OF OTHER ENTERTAINMENT ALTERNATIVES AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS DEPEND ON CONTINUED FAN SUPPORT. The League is currently one of four (4) minor professional hockey leagues in operation in the United States. Head-to-head competition has not typically occurred between the existing leagues, as each league has historically operated in a different geographic region of the United States. However, with recent expansion efforts of these leagues, the boundaries are beginning to become less defined and leagues are encroaching upon each other's markets, creating heightened competition. We not only compete against other minor professional hockey leagues but also against other professional sports and entertainment of all different types and mediums. For example, we compete with alternative entertainment venues located within our small to mid-size markets, such as bowling alleys, movie theatres, other sports events, and diverse amusement facilities. In addition, hockey is a relatively new and unfamiliar sport in many of the markets where the League operates. As a result, many of the League's teams have had difficulty building and maintaining a dedicated fan base. There can be no assurance that such teams will be able to maintain or increase their fan bases or, if the League expands, that its new teams will be able to build such a fan base. Our success depends on the League's ability to generate and sustain fan interest. Absent a substantial and dedicated fan base, Global Entertainment and the League may not be able to survive. We also experience significant competition in our arena management and ticketing businesses, primarily from much larger, better financed and more recognized companies. OUR CASH FLOW SEASONALITY MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO MANAGE MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS. A significant portion of our cash flow is generated from June 15 through September 15 each year. The seasonality of the League's revenues may make it difficult for us to meet current and future obligations that have payment dates or schedules that do not correspond to the seasonality of our cash flow. OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE ARENA DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, FACILITY MANAGEMENT VENUE SALES AND MARKETING AND TICKETING INDUSTRIES MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED. We acquired International Coliseums Company in November 2000. Prior to that time, we were engaged exclusively in the minor league hockey industry and had no prior experience in the development and construction of arenas. In January 2002 we formed Global Entertainment Marketing Systems to perform marketing and sales 13 activities related to multipurpose events facilities; we had no prior related experience. We began formal ticketing operations in September 2004 with no prior experience in the ticketing business. In September 2005 we began directly managing the operations of multipurpose events centers with no prior experience. Because of our recently acquired experience it is difficult to determine whether we will be able to successfully manage these businesses and compete in these industries. There are several engineering and consulting firms in direct competition with our arena development business. We also have several competitors in the facility management and ticketing businesses. Most of these competitors have substantially more financial resources and/or financial flexibility compared to Global. Furthermore, the engineering and design industry is undergoing consolidation, particularly in the United States. These competitive forces could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully operate and generate profits from our arena development business. IF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE EXPERIENCE AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, REVENUES ARE LIKELY TO DECLINE CAUSING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION TO DETERIORATE. Our revenues are likely to be significantly and adversely affected if economic conditions in the mid-sized communities in which we operate deteriorate. In particular, our arena development clients are likely to cut costs and delay, curtail, or cancel projects in response to deterioration in economic conditions either locally or nationally. These clients also may demand better pricing terms during such periods. In addition, an economic downturn may impact the credit-worthiness of these clients and the ability to collect cash from them to meet the operating needs of our arena development business. Accordingly, if current economic conditions worsen, our revenues, profits, and operating cash are likely to be adversely impacted. WE DEPEND ON KEY INDIVIDUALS, THE LOSS OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS. Our business depends on its ability to maintain certain key individuals and to attract and retain additional qualified and competent personnel. The loss of the services of Richard Kozuback, the President of Global Entertainment and Chairman of WPHL, or other key officers and directors, could have a material adverse effect on Global Entertainment's ability to conduct its business effectively. In addition, the ability to attract, retain, and expand the staff of qualified technical professionals employed by International Coliseums Company will be an important factor in determining our future success. A shortage of professionals qualified in certain technical areas exists from time to time in the engineering and design industry. The market for these professionals is competitive, and we may not be successful in our efforts to continue to attract and retain such professionals. WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS REGARDING FRANCHISING AND THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS COULD LIMIT OR PREVENT THE LEAGUE FROM OPERATING. We are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and business opportunity licenses, as well as state laws that regulate substantive aspects of the licensor/licensee relationship. The FTC's rules on franchising generally require us to furnish prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular containing information prescribed by the FTC rules, however, there are exceptions to this requirement based on the initial cost of a license and the licensee's financial condition. At least fifteen (15) states presently regulate the offer and sale of franchises and generally require registration of the franchise offering with state authorities. Our failure to comply with these rules could result in substantial penalties and damages, or suspension of part or all of the League's operations. OUR DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC VENUES MAY EXPOSE US TO LITIGATION. Our participation in the development, operation, and management of multipurpose sports and entertainment arenas attended by the public may expose us to additional exposure from litigation arising from the use of such facilities by the public. Although we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance to protect us against the risk of loss, there can be no assurance that we will not be a target in any potential litigation seeking substantial damages. We could be adversely impacted if we become involved in litigation. 14 WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH PLANS. We will require additional capital to continue to grow and possibly to survive. The arena development industry, in particular, is capital intensive and requires that we obtain additional working capital and additional funds to support our operations. Unless we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations, which we may not be able to achieve for the foreseeable future, we will continue to rely on equity financing and long-term debt to meet our cash requirements. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain financing on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, insufficient capital may require us to delay or scale back anticipated future activities. In addition, if additional capital is raised through equity-related financing, it could result in dilution to the ownership interests of existing stockholders. OUR COMMON STOCK IS THINLY TRADED AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE SECURITIES AT ALL OR WHEN YOU WANT TO DO SO. Our common stock currently is quoted on the American Stock Exchange and currently is thinly traded. Because of the limited public market for our common stock, you may be unable to sell our common stock when you want to do so. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None.
