Item 1A. Risk Factors Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We are currently involved in litigation and administrative proceedings involving some of our key patents; any invalidation or limitation of the scope of our key patents could significantly harm our business. Our patent portfolio contains some patents that are particularly significant to our ongoing revenues and business. As more fully described in Part I, Item 3Legal Proceedings, we are currently involved in litigation involving some of these key patents in the United States. The parties in these legal actions have challenged the validity, scope, enforceability and ownership of key patents that we license to generate a substantial portion of our revenues. In addition, reexamination requests have been filed against us in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with respect to certain key patent claims at issue in one or more of our litigation and arbitration proceedings, and oppositions have been filed against us with respect to key patents in the European Patent Office. Under a reexamination proceeding and upon completion of the proceeding, the PTO may leave a patent in its present form, narrow the scope of the patent or cancel some or all of the claims of the patent. As further described in Part I, Item 3Legal Proceedings, the PTO issued several Official Actions rejecting or maintaining earlier rejections of many of the claims in certain of our key patents. We are currently asserting these key patents and patent claims in certain of our ongoing litigation and administrative proceedings. If the PTOs adverse rulings are upheld on appeal and some or all of the claims of the key patents that are subject to reexamination are canceled, our business may be significantly harmed. In addition, counterparties to our litigation and administrative proceedings may seek and obtain motions to stay these proceedings based on rejections of claims in the PTO reexaminations, and other courts or tribunals reviewing our legal actions could make findings adverse to our interests, even if the PTO actions are not final. 11 Table of Contents We cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings or the myriad procedural and substantive motions in these proceedings. In the event that there is an adverse ruling in any legal or administrative proceeding relating to the infringement, validity, enforceability or ownership of any of our key patents, or if a court or an administrative body such as the PTO limits the scope of the claims of any of our key patents, we could be prevented from enforcing or earning future revenues from such key patents, and the likelihood that companies will take new licenses and that current licensees will continue to agree to pay under their existing licenses could be significantly reduced. The resulting reduction in license fees and royalties could significantly harm our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, or the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, regardless of the merits of any claim, the continued maintenance of these legal and administrative proceedings may result in substantial legal expenses and could divert our managements time and attention away from our other business operations, which could significantly harm our business. Our enforcement proceedings historically have been protracted and complex, and we have experienced significant delays in certain of these proceedings. The complexity of our litigations, their disproportionate importance to our business compared to other companies, the propensity for delay in patent litigations, and the potential that we may lose particular motions as well as the overall litigations all could cause significant volatility in our stock price and could materially adversely affect our business and consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We expect to continue to be involved in material legal proceedings in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, including material litigation with existing licensees or strategic partners, which could harm our business. In the past, we have found it necessary to litigate to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to enforce the terms of our existing license agreements, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Our current legal actions, as described in Part I, Item 3Legal Proceedings, are examples of significant disputes and litigation that impact our business. We expect to be involved in similar legal proceedings in the future, including proceedings to ensure proper and full payment of royalties by current licensees under the terms of their license agreements. These existing and any future legal actions could cause an existing licensee or strategic partner to cease making royalty or other payments to us, or to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents or the scope of our license agreements, and could significantly damage our relationship with such licensee or strategic partner. Litigation could also severely disrupt or shut down the business operations of our licensees or strategic partners, which in turn would significantly harm our ongoing relations with them and cause us to lose royalty revenues. In addition, many semiconductor and package assembly companies maintain their own internal design groups and have their own package design and manufacturing capabilities. If we believe these groups have designed technologies that infringe upon our intellectual property, and if they subsequently fail to enter into a license agreement with us or pay for licensed technology, then it may become necessary for us to commence legal proceedings against them. Litigation stemming from these or other disputes could also harm our relationships with other licensees or our ability to gain new customers, who may postpone licensing decisions pending the outcome of the litigation or dispute. In addition, these legal proceedings could be very expensive and may reduce or eliminate our profits. The costs associated with legal proceedings are typically high, relatively unpredictable and not completely within our control. While we do our best to forecast and control such costs, the costs may be materially higher than expected, which could adversely affect our operating results. Whether or not determined in our favor or ultimately settled, litigation diverts our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from our business operations. Furthermore, an adverse decision in any of these legal actions could result in a loss of our proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses from others, limit the value of our licensed technology or otherwise negatively impact our stock price or our business and consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Even if we prevail in our legal actions, significant contingencies will exist to their settlement and final resolution, including the scope of the liability of each party, our ability to enforce judgments against the parties, the ability of the parties to make any payments owed or agreed upon and the dismissal of the legal action by the relevant court, none of which are completely within our control. Parties that may be obligated to pay us royalties could also decide to alter their business activities or corporate structure, which could affect our ability to collect royalties from such parties. 12 Table of Contents If we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and our confidential information, our business will suffer. We rely primarily on a combination of license, development and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our licensees and others may seek to use our technology without the payment of license fees and royalties, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation. The growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to convince third parties of the applicability of our intellectual property to their products, and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights against them. In certain instances, we attempt to obtain patent protection for portions of our intellectual property, and our license agreements typically include both issued patents and pending patent applications. If we fail to obtain patents or if the patents issued to us do not cover all of the claims included in our patent applications, others could use portions of our intellectual property without the payment of license fees and royalties. We also rely on trade secret laws rather than patent laws to protect other portions of our proprietary technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. The misappropriation of our trade secrets or other proprietary information could seriously harm our business. We protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, suppliers and customers. We cannot be certain that these contracts have not been and will not be breached, that we will be able to timely detect unauthorized use or transfer of our intellectual property, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If we fail to use these mechanisms to protect our intellectual property, or if a court fails to enforce our intellectual property rights, our business will suffer. We cannot be certain that these protection mechanisms can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated or challenged. Our revenues may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce our intellectual property rights or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights. We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in our technology. However, any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our technology adequately against unauthorized third-party use, which could adversely affect our business. Third parties also may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and will divert managements attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards. Even if we have an agreement that provides for a third party to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to perform its contractual obligations under the agreement. If we cannot or do not license the infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms, or substitute similar technology from another source, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could suffer. If the U.S. patent laws and regulations are changed, we could be adversely impacted. Our business relies in part on the uniform and historically consistent application of United States patent laws and regulations. Changes to these laws and regulations may occur as a result of decisions and actions of Congress, the PTO, and the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. In recent years, certain proposals have been made to change some aspects of the patent laws and PTO rules, and the U.S. Supreme Court has decided a number of patent cases and continues to actively review more patent cases than it has in the past. Some of these 13 Table of Contents changes or potential changes may not be advantageous for us, and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce our patents against parties using them without a license or payment of royalties. These changes or potential changes, if passed by Congress or implemented by the Administration, could have a deleterious affect on our licensing program and, therefore, the royalties we can collect. The market for semiconductors and related products is highly concentrated, and we have limited opportunities to sell our products. The semiconductor industry is highly concentrated in that a small number of semiconductor designers and manufacturers account for a substantial portion of the purchases of semiconductor products generally, including our products and products incorporating technologies that we may acquire. Consolidation in the semiconductor industry may increase this concentration. Accordingly, we expect that sales of our products, including sales of products and technologies that we acquire, will be concentrated with a limited number of customers for the foreseeable future. As we acquire new technologies and integrate them into our product line, we will need to establish new relationships to sell these products. Our financial results depend in significant part on our success in establishing and maintaining relationships with, and effecting substantial sales to, these customers. Even if we are successful in establishing and maintaining such relationships, our financial results will be dependent in large part on these customers sales and business results. A significant amount of our royalty revenues comes from a few market segments and products, and our business could be harmed if these market segments or products decline. A significant portion of our royalty revenues comes from the manufacture and sale of packaged semiconductor chips for DSP, ASSP, ASIC and memory. In addition, we derive substantial revenues from the incorporation of our technology into mobile phones. If demand for semiconductors in any one or a combination of these market segments or products declines, our royalty revenues may be reduced significantly and our business could be harmed. Moreover, were such declines to occur, our business could become more cyclical in nature. Our revenue is concentrated in a few customers and if we lose any of these customers our revenues may decrease substantially. We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2008, there were two customers that each accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. We expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of customers for the foreseeable future. If we lose any of these customers, our revenues may decrease substantially. Volume pricing incentives in our TCC licenses with two DRAM manufacturers may slow our DRAM royalty growth. In 2005, we provided two major DRAM manufacturers with first-mover pricing advantages in respect of royalties due us under their respective TCC licenses based on several factors, including volumes. The effect of the volume pricing adjustments may be to cause, at certain high shipment volumes and for these two DRAM manufacturers only, our aggregate annual DRAM royalty revenue to grow less rapidly than annual growth in overall unit shipments in the DRAM segment. An additional effect may be to cause, depending on the relative DRAM market share enjoyed by these two DRAM manufacturers in a given calendar quarter and their royalty payments within a calendar year, some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in growth in our revenues from the DRAM segment. 14 Table of Contents Some of our license agreements have fixed terms and, in order to maintain our relationships with licensees under such agreements, we will need to renegotiate some of our existing license agreements in the future. Some of our license agreements have fixed terms. We will need to renegotiate license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of such license agreements and, based on various factors including the technology and business needs of our licensees, we may not be able to renegotiate such license agreements on similar terms, or at all. In order to maintain existing relationships with some of our licensees, we may be forced to renegotiate license agreements on terms that are more favorable to such licensees, which could harm our results of operations. If we fail to renegotiate our license agreements we would lose existing licensees and our business would be materially adversely affected. Some of our license agreements may convert to fully paid-up licenses at the expiration of their terms, and we may not receive royalties after that time. We currently have one license agreement that automatically converts to a fully paid-up license after the expiration of its current term on December 31, 2013, provided that the licensee (Texas Instruments) complies with all terms and conditions of the license agreement up through its expiration. We also have certain other license agreements that each provide the licensee with the option to extend the current term of their agreement for an additional five years with royalty payments throughout the expiration of the extended term, whereupon such a license automatically converts to a fully paid-up license after the expiration of its extended term. We may not receive further royalties from licensees for any licensed technology under those agreements if they convert to fully paid-up licenses because such licensees will be entitled to continue using some, if not all, of our relevant intellectual property under the terms of the license agreements, even if relevant patents are still in effect. A significant conversion of our license agreements to fully paid-up licenses could materially harm our results of operations following such conversion. We have a royalty-based business model, which is inherently risky. Our long-term success depends on future royalties paid to us by licensees. Royalty payments under our TCC licenses are primarily based upon the number of electrical connections to the semiconductor chip in a package covered by our licensed technology. We also have royalty arrangements for TCC and other technologies in which royalties are paid based upon a percent of the net sales price or in which royalties are paid on a per package basis. We are dependent upon our ability to structure, negotiate and enforce agreements for the determination and payment of royalties, as well as upon our licensees compliance with their agreements. We face risks inherent in a royalty-based business model, many of which are outside of our control, such as the following:  the rate of adoption and incorporation of our technology by semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers;  the extent to which large equipment vendors and materials providers develop and supply tools and materials to enable manufacturing using our packaging technology;  the demand for products incorporating semiconductors that use our licensed technology;  the cyclicality of supply and demand for products using our licensed technology;  the impact of economic downturns; and  the timing of receipt of royalty reports may not meet our revenue recognition criteria resulting in fluctuation in our results of operations. It is difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose revenues. The standard terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document the manufacture and sale of products that incorporate our technology and report this data to us on a quarterly basis. Although our standard 15 Table of Contents license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, flawed and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our licensees. Our license compliance program randomly audits licensees to independently verify the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that the random audits will be effective to that end. We make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable or could limit our revenue growth. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing of new technologies, products and services, including wafer level packaging, wafer level camera and other image quality enhancement technologies, and µPILR packaging technology. Investments in new technologies are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness and demand for the technology, delays or shortages of materials and equipment, and effective licensing or product sales. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new technologies, products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. Competing technologies may harm our business. We expect that our technologies will continue to compete with technologies of internal design groups of semiconductor manufacturers, assemblers and electronic and system manufacturers. These internal design groups create their own packaging and optics solutions, and have direct access to their companys technical information and technology roadmaps, and have capacity, cost and technical advantages over us. If these internal design groups design around our patents or introduce unique solutions superior to our technology, they may not need to license our technology. These groups may design technology that is less expensive to implement than ours or provides products with higher performance or additional features. Many of these groups have substantially greater resources, financial or otherwise, than us and lower cost structures, and the inherent advantage of internal access to corporate strategies. As a result, they may be able to bring alternative solutions to market more easily and quickly. For instance, certain flip chip technologies are being used by large semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers for a variety of semiconductors, including processors and memory. Another example of a competitive technology is the small format lead frame packages that are also gaining popularity. The companies using these technologies are utilizing their current lead frame infrastructure to achieve cost-effective results. Wafer-level packaging is an emerging competitive technology that could also erode chip-scale packaging market share as the technology and infrastructure matures. Other examples of competitive technologies are the chip-on-board technique to package image sensors and the system-in-package technology that can integrate multiple die without chip-scale packaging. In the future, our licensed technologies may also compete with other technologies. These technologies may be less expensive than ours and provide higher or additional performance. Companies with these competing technologies may also have greater resources than us. Technological change could render our technologies obsolete, and new, competitive technologies could emerge that achieve broad adoption and adversely affect the use of our technologies and intellectual property. If we do not create and implement new designs to expand our licensable technology portfolio, our competitive position could be harmed and our operating results adversely affected. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from licenses and royalties from a relatively small number of key technologies. We plan to devote significant engineering resources in order to develop new packaging and imaging technologies to address the evolving needs of the semiconductor and the consumer and communication electronics industries. To remain competitive, we must introduce new technologies or designs in a timely manner 16 Table of Contents and the market must adopt them. Developments in our technologies are inherently complex, and require long development cycles and a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability. We may not be able to develop and market new technologies in a timely or commercially acceptable fashion. Moreover, our patents will expire in the future. Our currently issued U.S. patents expire at various times from March 9, 2010 through August 10, 2027. We need to develop or acquire successful innovations and obtain new patents before our current patents expire, and our failure to do so could significantly harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. If we do not successfully further develop and commercialize the technologies we acquire, or cultivate strategic relationship that expand our licensable technology portfolio, our competitive position could be harmed and our operating results adversely affected. We also attempt to expand our licensable technology portfolio and technical expertise by acquiring and further developing new technologies or developing strategic relationships with others. These strategic relationships may include the right for us to sublicense technology and intellectual property to others. However, we may not be able to acquire or obtain rights to licensable technology and intellectual property in a timely manner or upon commercially reasonable terms. Even if we do acquire such rights, some of the technologies we invest in may be commercially unproven and may not be adopted or accepted by the industry. Moreover, our research and development efforts, and acquisitions and strategic relationships, may be futile if we do not accurately predict the future needs of the semiconductor, consumer and communication electronics, and consumer imaging industries. Our failure to acquire new technologies that are commercially viable in the semiconductor, consumer and communication electronics, and consumer imaging industries could significantly harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Failure by our licensees to sell products using our technology could limit our royalty revenue growth. Because we expect a portion of our future revenues to be derived from licenses and royalties from semiconductors that use our licensed technology, our future success depends upon our licensees developing and selling commercially successful products. Any of the following factors could limit our licensees ability to sell products that incorporate our technology:  the willingness and ability of materials and equipment suppliers to produce materials and equipment that support our licensed technology, in a quantity sufficient to enable volume manufacturing;  the ability of our licensees to purchase such materials and equipment on a cost-effective and timely basis;  the willingness of our licensees and others to make investments in the manufacturing process that supports our licensed technology, and the amount and timing of those investments; and  our licensees ability to design and assemble packages incorporating our technology that are acceptable to their customers. Because we expect a portion of our future growth to be derived from licenses and royalties from our imaging and optics technology in consumer electronics, such as digital still cameras, wireless devices, personal computers and other consumer electronics, our future success depends upon our licensees developing and selling products that incorporate our technology. Any of the following factors could limit the growth of our imaging and optics technology:  our ability to innovate and provide solutions at lower costs, with improved performance, or with more enhanced features than our competitors;  the relevant markets rate of adoption of our imaging and optics;  our ability to license our technologies to significant customers in imaging and optics fields; and 17 Table of Contents  our competitors who may have superior products or solutions which take away market shares or design wins from us. Failure by the semiconductor industry to adopt next generation high performance DRAM chips that utilize our packaging technology would significantly harm our business. To date, our packaging technology has been used by several companies for high performance DRAM chips. For example, packaging using our technology is used for DDR2 DRAM and we currently have licensees, including Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd., Qimonda AG, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc., who are paying royalties for DRAM chips in advanced packages. DRAM manufacturers are also currently developing next generation high performance DRAM chips, including next generation of DDR referred to as DDR3 and DDR4, to meet increasing speed and performance requirements of electronic products. We believe that these next-generation, high performance DRAM chips will require advanced packaging technologies such as CSP. We anticipate that royalties from shipments of these next-generation, high performance DRAM chips packaged using our technology may account for a significant percentage of our future revenues. If semiconductor manufacturers do not continue to adopt next generation, high performance DRAM packages using our technology and find an alternate viable packaging technology for use with next generation high performance DRAM chips, or if we do not receive royalties from next generation, high performance DRAM chips that use our technology, our future revenues could be adversely affected. Our technology may be too expensive for certain next generation high performance DRAM manufacturers, which could significantly reduce the adoption rate of our packaging technology in next generation high performance DRAM chips. Even if our package technology is selected for at least some of these next generation high performance DRAM chips, there could be delays in the introduction of products utilizing these chips that could materially affect the amount and timing of any royalty payments that we receive. Other factors that could affect adoption of our technology for next generation high performance DRAM products include delays or shortages of materials and equipment and the availability of testing services. If our licensees cannot make or delay payments to us due to financial difficulties, or shift their licensed products to other companies to lower their royalties to us, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. A number of companies in the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries are facing severe financial difficulties. As a result, there have been recent bankruptcies and restructuring of companies in these industries. Our licensees may also face financial difficulties and may seek insolvency proceedings such as bankruptcy and restructuring which may result in their inabilities to make payments to us timely or if at all. In addition, our licensees may merge with or may shift the manufacture of licensed products to companies that are not currently licensees to us. This could make the collection process complex and difficult which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The way we integrate acquired technology into our products may not be accepted by customers. We have devoted, and expect to continue to devote, considerable time and resources to acquiring and integrating new technologies, such as the technologies acquired from Eyesquad GmbH, Digital Optics Corporation, Shellcase, Ltd., North Corporation and FotoNation, into our products. However, if customers do not accept the way we have integrated this technology, they may adopt competing solutions. In addition, as we introduce new products, we cannot predict with certainty if and when our customers will transition to those new products. If customers fail to accept new or upgraded products incorporating our technologies, our financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted. 18 Table of Contents Our services business, including customization services, may subject us to specific costs and risks that we may fail to manage adequately and could harm our business. We derive a portion of our revenues from engineering and design services. Among the engineering services that we offer are customized package design and prototyping, modeling, simulation, failure analysis and reliability testing and related training services. We also offer our customers design services to customize our technologies to incorporate into their products and production processes, enabling our customers to shorten the development effort and time to market. A number of factors, including, among others, the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under our service contracts, could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline, damage our reputation, and harm our ability to attract future licensees, which would in turn harm our operating results. Under our services contracts we are required to perform certain services, in some cases including delivering designs and prototypes. If we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts, we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract. We also provide certain services at or below cost in an effort to increase the speed and breadth with which the semiconductor industry adopts our technologies. For example, we provide modeling, manufacturing process training, equipment and materials characterization and other services to assist licensees in designing, implementing, upgrading and maintaining their packaging assembly line. We frequently provide these services as a form of training to introduce new licensees to our technology and existing clients to new technologies, with the aim that these services will help us to generate revenues in the future. We need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues. Our failure to monitor these services or our design and prototype services adequately may harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because our services sometimes involve the delivery of package or lens designs and prototypes, we may be subject to claims that we infringed or induced the infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights belonging to others. If such a claim were made, we may have to take a license or stop manufacturing the accused prototypes, which could cause our services revenues to decrease. If we choose not to take a license, we may be sued for infringement, and may incur significant litigation costs in defending against the lawsuit. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may have to pay damages and could be subject to an injunction preventing us from continuing to provide the services. Any of these outcomes could harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our licensing cycle is lengthy and costly, and our marketing and sales efforts may be unsuccessful. We generally incur significant marketing and sales expenses prior to entering into our license agreements, generating a license fee and establishing a royalty stream from each licensee. The length of time it takes to establish a new licensing relationship can range from six to 18 months or longer for a TCC license and 18 to 24 months or longer for an imaging & optics license. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins. We employ intensive marketing and sales efforts to educate materials suppliers, equipment vendors, licensees, potential licensees and original equipment manufacturers about the benefits of our technologies. In addition, even if these companies adopt our technologies, they must devote significant resources to integrate fully our technologies into their operations. If our marketing and sales efforts are unsuccessful, then we will not be able to achieve widespread acceptance of our packaging technology. In addition, ongoing litigation could impact our ability to gain new licensees. 19 Table of Contents We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. Even though we are no longer pursuing government or government agency business, we are still subject to various statutes and regulations related to this business. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions such as audit provisions that may not be applicable to private contracts. Although we have performed our obligations under these government contracts, we are subject to audits relating to compliance with the regulations governing these government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations or an adverse audit finding might result in an adjustment to our revenue previously recorded, debarment from future government contracts, and possible civil and criminal penalties. In addition, the government may acquire certain intellectual property rights in data produced or delivered under such contracts and inventions made under such contracts. Our financial and operating results may vary, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. We currently provide guidance on revenue, expenses and cash taxes on a quarterly basis. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future. Because our operating results are difficult to predict, you should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate during any period include those listed in this Risk Factors section of this report and the following:  the timing and compliance with license or service agreements and the terms and conditions for payment to us of license or service fees under these agreements;  changes in our royalties caused by changes in demand for products incorporating semiconductors that use our licensed technology;  the amount of our service revenues;  changes in the level of our operating expenses;  delays in our introduction of new technologies or market acceptance of these new technologies through new license agreements;  our ability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the terms of our agreements;  legal proceedings affecting our patents, patent applications or license agreements;  the timing of the introduction by others of competing technologies;  changes in demand for semiconductor chips in the specific markets in which we concentrateDSP, ASIC, ASSP semiconductors and memory;  changes in accounting principles; and  cyclical fluctuations in semiconductor markets generally. It is difficult to predict when we will enter into additional license agreements. The time it takes to establish a new licensing arrangement can be lengthy. Delays or deferrals in the execution of license agreements may also increase as we develop new technologies. Because the recognition period of our license revenue is dependent on meeting the requirements for revenue recognition, the timing of revenue being recognized may significantly impact our quarterly or annual operating results. Under our typical license agreements, we also receive ongoing royalty payments, and these payments may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on manufacture or sales of products incorporating our licensed technology. We expect to continue to expand our business, which will require us to increase our operating expenses. We may not be able to increase revenues in an amount sufficient to offset these increased expenditures, which may lead to a loss for a quarterly period. 20 Table of Contents Due to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and other factors, the price at which our common stock will trade is likely to continue to be highly volatile. In future periods, if our revenues or operating results are below our estimates or the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. Technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility than companies in many other industries in recent years and, as a result, have, on average, been subject to a greater number of securities class action claims. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. The investment of our cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. At December 31, 2008, we held $87.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $210.7 million in short-term and long-term investments. These sums were invested in various financial securities such as corporate and municipal bonds, variable rate demand notes, asset-backed obligations, auction rate securities, commercial paper, agency bonds and notes, money market funds meeting certain criteria, and cash held at bank demand accounts. The ongoing financial turmoil, originally caused by the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States, has at times adversely impacted the general credit, liquidity, market and interest rates for these and other types of debt securities. The financial market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our investments as of December 31, 2008 include $22.1 million in auction rate municipal bond securities (ARS) and asset-backed securities, including mortgaged-backed securities (collectively ABS). In connection with the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets, our ARS and ABS holdings have experienced failed auctions or thinly traded markets. A failed auction results when sell orders exceed buy orders. As of December 31, 2008, we have recorded a loss to earnings of $1.5 million due to an other-than-temporary impairment of ABS investments and a loss of $4.0 million due to the transfer of ARS investments to trading securities, offset by a gain of $4.0 million to earnings related to the UBS rights discussed further in Note 5Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report. In addition, we have recorded net unrealized losses of $0.8 million, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a reduction in stockholders equity, reflecting adjustments to the remaining available-for-sale securities with a temporary decline in value. See Note 5Financial Instruments for additional information about our marketable securities. As a result of auction failures and thinly traded markets, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our ARS and ABS in the near term may be limited or not exist. We may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments recorded value. If uncertainties in these credit and capital markets continue, these markets deteriorate further or we experience any additional deterioration in underlying collateral on any investments in our portfolio, we may incur impairment charges or additional unrealized losses, and investments may be reclassified as long-term investments in our financial statements in future reporting periods. These events could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The recent economic downturn and financial crisis could negatively affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Recent worldwide economic and market conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with a global recession and worsening credit conditions continuing in 2009. Slower economic activity, increased unemployment, the continued crisis in the financial and credit markets, concerns about inflation and energy costs, decreased business and consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns have contributed to and continue to contribute to a global recession. This global recession has led to reduced customer spending in the wireless communications and semiconductor markets, made it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, 21 Table of Contents and has caused U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products and services. Our major licensees have experienced reductions in semiconductor sales which could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, the crisis in the capital and credit markets limits the ability of our customers to timely borrow and access the capital and credit markets to meet their liquidity needs, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us and reduce their demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows. We operate in a highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and is characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, this industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, declining economic conditions, maturing product and technology cycles, and excess inventories. This cyclicality could cause our operating results to decline dramatically from one period to the next. Our business depends heavily upon the volume of production by our licensees, which, in turn, depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors. Similarly, our services business relies at least in part upon the outsourcing of design and engineering projects by the semiconductor industry. Semiconductor manufacturers and package assembly companies generally sharply curtail their spending during industry downturns, such as in the current global recession, and historically have lowered their spending more than the decline in their revenues. As a result, the impact of the current global economic downturn on our businesses is exacerbated by the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. If we are unable to control our expenses adequately in response to lower revenues from our licensees and service customers in the current or any future economic downturn, our operating results may suffer and we may experience operating losses. Future changes in, or interpretations of, financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue and expense fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Recent accounting pronouncements and their estimated potential impact on our business are addressed in the Note 3Recent Accounting Pronouncements of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The international nature of our business exposes us to financial and regulatory risks that may have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow, and we may have difficulty protecting our intellectual property in some foreign countries. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from licensees headquartered outside of the United States. We have also expanded our operations outside of the United States such as research and development facilities in Japan, Israel, Ireland and Romania to design, develop, test or market certain technologies. International operations are subject to a number of risks, including but not limited to the following:  Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies as our revenues are denominated in principally in U.S. dollars and a portion of our costs are based in non U.S. dollars;  Security concerns, including crime, political instability, terrorist activity, anti-American sentiment, armed conflict and civil or military unrest;  Changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; 22 Table of Contents  Regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions;  Laws and business practices favoring local companies;  Withholding tax obligations on license revenues that we may not be able to offset fully against our U.S. tax obligations, including the further risk that foreign tax authorities may re-characterize license fees or increase tax rates, which could result in increased tax withholdings and penalties;  Differing employment practices, labor issues and business and cultural factors;  Less effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the U.S. or other developed countries; and  Limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers. Our intellectual property is also used in a large number of foreign countries. There are many countries, such as India, in which we currently have no issued patents. In addition, effective intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. It may be difficult for us to protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by other companies in these countries. We expect this to become a greater problem for us as our licensees increase their manufacturing in countries which provide less protection for intellectual property. Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights in some countries may harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our business and operating results may be harmed if we are unable to manage growth in our business or if we undertake any restructuring activities. We plan to continue the expansion of our operations, domestically and internationally, and may continue to do so through both internal growth and acquisitions. This expansion may strain our systems and management, operational and financial controls and resources. In addition, we are likely to incur higher operating costs. To manage our growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our management, systems and financial controls. We also need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee base. We cannot ensure that we will be able to timely and effectively meet demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers and licensees. If we are unable to effectively manage our growth or we are unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining personnel, our business and operating results will be harmed. From time to time, we may undertake to restructure our business. There are several factors that could cause a restructuring to have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These include potential disruption of our operations, the timing of development of our technology, the deliveries to our customers and other aspects of our business. Employee morale and productivity could also suffer and we may lose employees whom we want to keep. Any restructuring would require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work. If we undertake employee reductions or other restructuring activities, we may incur restructuring and related expenses that may be material to our company. Moreover, we could encounter delays in executing any restructuring plans, which could cause further disruption and additional unanticipated expense. We may dispose of or discontinue product lines or business divisions if our existing product lines do not fit into our strategic vision or meet forecasted results, which may adversely impact our business operations and financial condition. As our strategy continues to evolve and the business climate continues to change, we may dispose, discontinue, or divest our product lines or business divisions. Disposing or discontinuing existing product lines or business divisions provides no assurance that our operating expenses will be reduced or will not cause us to incur material charges associated with such decision. Furthermore, the disposition or discontinuance of an existing product line or business division entails various risks, including the risk of not being able to obtain a purchaser, 23 Table of Contents or, if obtained, the purchase price may not be equal to at least the net asset book value for the product line. Other risks include adversely affecting employee morale, managing the expectations of, and maintaining good relations with, our customers of our disposed or discontinued product lines or business divisions, which could prevent us from selling other products to them. We may also incur other significant liabilities and costs associated with our disposal or discontinuance of product lines or business divisions, including employee severance costs, relocation expenses, and impairment of lease obligations and long-lived assets. Certain disputes regarding our intellectual property may require us to indemnify certain licensees, the cost of which could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. While we generally do not indemnify our licensees, some of our license agreements in imaging and optics provide limited indemnities for certain actions brought by third parties against our licensees, and some require us to provide technical support and information to a licensee that is involved in litigation for using our technology. We expect to agree to provide similar indemnity or support obligations to future licensees. Our indemnity and support obligations could result in substantial expenses. In addition to the time and expense required for us to indemnify or supply such support to our licensees, a licensees development, marketing and sales of licensed imaging and optics products could be severely disrupted or shut down as a result of litigation, which in turn could severely hamper our business operations and consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We could experience losses due to product liability claims. We sell products and provide services that may subject us to product liability claims in the future. Although we carry liability insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate, product liability claims can be costly and any future product liability claim made against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies, be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policies or cause us to record a self-insured loss. A product liability claim in excess of our insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if a product liability loss is covered by our insurance policies, such policies contain substantial retentions and deductibles that we would be required to pay. Our existing insurance may not be renewed at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that presently in effect, or at all. The payment of retentions or deductibles for a significant amount of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow. If we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, legal and finance personnel, many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace. None of our senior management, key technical personnel or key sales personnel are bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period. In addition, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our key personnel. The loss of any of our senior management or other key personnel could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. Moreover, some of the individuals on our management team have been in their current positions for a relatively short period of time. Our future success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our management team to work together effectively. Many of our senior management personnel and other key employees have become, or will soon become, vested in their initial stock options grants. While we often grant additional stock options to management personnel and other key employees after their hire dates to provide additional incentives to remain employed by us, their initial grants are usually much larger than follow-on grants. Employees may be more likely to leave us after their initial option grant fully vests, especially if the shares underlying the options have significantly 24 Table of Contents appreciated in value relative to the option exercise price. If any members of our senior management team leave the company, our ability to successfully operate our business could be impaired. We also may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring, training and retaining replacements for departing employees. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales, marketing, legal and finance personnel and on the abilities of new personnel to function effectively, both individually and as a group. Competition for qualified senior employees can be intense. For example, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth and expansion. Further, we must train our new personnel, especially our technical support personnel, to respond to and support our licensees and customers. If we fail to do this, it could lead to dissatisfaction among our licensees or customers, which could slow our growth or result in a loss of business. Our business operations could suffer in the event of information technology systems failures or security breaches. Despite system redundancy and the implementation of security measures within our internal and external information technology and networking systems, our information technology systems may be subject to security breaches, damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, and telecommunication failures. Any system failure or security breach could cause interruptions in our operations in addition to the possibility of losing proprietary information and trade secrets. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches. Decreased effectiveness of share-based compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees. We have historically used stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation as key components of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages. Since the adoption of SFAS 123(R), Share-Based Payment, we have recorded increased compensation costs associated with our stock-based compensation programs. Moreover, difficulties relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it harder or more expensive for us to grant stock- based compensation to employees in the future. As a result, we may find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business. Failure to comply with environmental regulations could harm our business. We use hazardous substances in the manufacturing and testing of prototype products and in the development of our technologies in our research and development laboratories. We are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances. Our past, present or future failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on us, suspension of production, and alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations. Compliance with such regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur other substantial expenses. Any failure by us to control the use, disposal, removal or storage of, or to adequately restrict the discharge of, or assist in the cleanup of, hazardous or toxic substances, could subject us to significant liabilities, including joint and several liabilities under certain statutes. The imposition of such liabilities could significantly harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 25 Table of Contents We have business operations located globally in places that are subject to natural disasters. Our business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities, computer systems and personnel. Our locations may be subject to earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters. Should a hurricane, earthquake or other catastrophe, such a fire, flood, power loss, communication failure or similar event disable our facilities, we do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could conduct our business. Some of our offices are located in states or countries where the local governments may be in financial crisis which may interrupt our business operations and adversely impact our results of operations. We operate our business globally in many jurisdictions worldwide. Our corporate headquarters are located in the state of California which has recently declared the possibility of insolvency. As a result, the state has stopped certain improvement projects and disrupted certain services to its residents, and future state actions are uncertain. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if the state proposes additional taxation or other measures to increase its revenue through tax levies on corporations like us or on its residents, like our employees. In addition, we have operations in the various countries worldwide, including Hungary and Romania, where the countries may be facing financial crisis. For example, the government of Hungary has implemented special taxes on corporations in 2007 and has notably increased its tax examination activities. If the governments of these states or countries where we have business operations cannot provide public services, impose additional tax regulations or levies, or increase their tax examination activities, our business operations may be interrupted and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. We have made and may continue to make acquisitions which could divert managements attention, cause ownership dilution to our stockholders, or be difficult to integrate, which may adversely affect our financial results. We have made several acquisitions, and it is our current plan to continue to acquire companies and technologies that we believe are strategic to our future business. Integrating newly acquired businesses or technologies could put a strain on our resources, could be costly and time consuming, and might not be successful. Such acquisitions could divert our managements attention from other business concerns. In addition, we might lose key employees while integrating new organizations. Acquisitions could also result in customer dissatisfaction, performance problems with an acquired company or technology, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, the assumption or incurrence of contingent liabilities, possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances, any of which could harm our business. Our plans to integrate and expand upon research and development programs and technologies initiated at each of our operating locations, including image sensor packaging, wafer level optics and camera technology from our operation in Charlotte, North Carolina, image enhancement technology for digital auto focus and optical zoom from our operation in Tel Aviv, Israel, and microelectronics packaging and system integration from our operation in San Jose, California, may result in products or technologies that are not adopted by the market. The market may adopt competitive solutions to our products or technologies. Consequently, we might not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses, products or technologies, and might not achieve anticipated revenues and cost benefits. 26 Table of Contents There are numerous risks with our recent acquisitions, which include FotoNation, Inc., Eyesquad GmbH and Digital Optics Corporation and certain assets from Shellcase, Ltd. and North Corporation. In February 2008, we completed our acquisition of FotoNation, Inc., a company headquartered in Burlingame, California. In February 2007, we acquired Eyesquad GmbH, a company based in Munich, Germany and certain assets from North Corporation, a company based in Yokohama, Japan. In July 2006, we completed our acquisition of Digital Optics Corporation, a company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. In December 2005, we completed our acquisition of certain equipment, intellectual property and other intangible assets from Shellcase, Ltd., a company based in Israel. These acquisitions are subject to a number of risks, including the following:  These acquisitions could fail to produce anticipated benefits, or could have other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee. As a result, these acquisitions could result in a reduction of net income per share as compared to the net income per share we would have achieved if these acquisitions had not occurred.  Following completion of these acquisitions, we may uncover additional liabilities or unforeseen expenses not discovered during our diligence process. Any such additional liabilities or expenses could result in significant unanticipated costs not originally estimated, such as impairment charges of acquired assets and goodwill, and may harm our financial results.  The integration of Eyesquad GmbH, Digital Optics Corporation, FotoNation, Inc. and of the Shellcase, Ltd. and the North Corporation assets and personnel will be a time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt our operations if it is not completed in a timely and efficient manner. If our integration efforts are not successful, our results of operations could be harmed, employee morale could decline, key employees could leave, and customer relations could be damaged. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits from any of these acquisitions.  We have incurred substantial direct transaction costs as a result of these acquisitions and anticipate incurring substantial additional costs to support the integration of Eyesquad GmbH, Digital Optics Corporation, FotoNation, Inc. and the assets of Shellcase, Ltd. and North Corporation. The total cost of the integration may exceed our expectations.  Sales of the acquired businesses may be subject to different accounting treatment than our existing businesses, especially related to the recognition of revenue. This may lead to potential deferral of revenue due to new multiple-element revenue arrangements. If our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets (such as acquired patents), or equity investments become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. In addition to internal development, we intend to broaden our intellectual property portfolio through internal development, strategic relationships and acquisitions. We believe this will enhance the competitiveness and size of our current businesses and diversify into markets and technologies that complement our current businesses. These acquisitions could be in the form of asset purchases, equity investments, or business combinations. As a result, we may have intangible assets which are amortized over their estimated useful lives, equity investments and goodwill. Under GAAP, we are required to review our amortizable intangible assets such as patent portfolio and equity investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or equity investments may not be recoverable include a decline in future cash flows, slower growth rates in our industry or slower than anticipated adoption of our products by our customers. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or equity investments is determined, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 27 Table of Contents Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, new SEC regulations and NASDAQ Stock Market rules, have created uncertainty for companies. These laws, regulations and standards are often subject to varying interpretations. As a result, their application in practice may evolve as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result of our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, we have increased and will likely continue to increase general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or Delaware law might delay or prevent a change of control transaction and depress the market price of our stock. Various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws might have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of our company. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Certain of these provisions eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors, authorize the board to issue blank check preferred stock, prohibit stockholder action by written consent, eliminate the right of stockholders to call special meetings, limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors, and establish advance notice procedures for director nominations by stockholders and the submission of other proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law which could delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. In particular, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless specific conditions are met. Any of these provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including without limitation, discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock.
