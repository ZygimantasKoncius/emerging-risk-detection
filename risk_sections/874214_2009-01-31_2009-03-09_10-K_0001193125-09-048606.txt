ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. The following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and the forward-looking information in this document. Please also see Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosures. The risks described below are not the only risks our business faces. We may also be adversely affected by additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. Our ability to anticipate and respond to changing client preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner Our success largely depends on our ability to consistently gauge fashion trends and provide merchandise that satisfies client demands for each of our brands in a timely manner. Any missteps may affect inventory levels, since we enter into agreements to manufacture and purchase our merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately in a timely manner to changes in fashion trends and economic conditions could lead to lower sales, missed opportunities, excess inventories and more frequent markdowns, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Merchandise misjudgments could also negatively impact our image with our clients and result in diminished brand loyalty. Our ability to manage inventory levels The long lead time usually required for our merchandise makes client demand difficult to predict and responding to changes quickly challenging. Our financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in client demand patterns. Inventory levels in excess of client demand may result in excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins. If we underestimate demand for our merchandise, on the other hand, we may experience inventory shortages resulting in missed sales and lost revenues. Either of these events could significantly harm our operating results and brand image. The effect of competitive pressures from other retailers The specialty retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with national, international and local department stores, specialty and discount stores, catalogs and internet businesses offering similar categories of merchandise. Many of our competitors are companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully with them in the future. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable store locations, lease terms and qualified associates. Increased competition could reduce our sales and margins and adversely affect results of operations. Our ability to secure and protect trademarks and other intellectual property rights We believe that our AnnTaylor, AnnTaylor Loft and LOFT trademarks are important to our success. Even though we register and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, there is no assurance that our actions will protect us from the prior registration by others or prevent others from infringing our trademarks and proprietary rights or seeking to block sales of our products as infringements of their trademarks and proprietary rights. Further, the laws of foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Because we have not registered all of our trademarks in all categories, or in all foreign countries in which we manufacture merchandise now or in the future, our international expansion and sourcing of merchandise could be limited. Our license to use the Ann Taylor trademark for manufacturing and exporting purposes in the Peoples Republic of China expires on June 30, 2015 unless the parties agree to an extension. The effect of general economic conditions and the current financial crisis The Companys performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending, which have continued to deteriorate and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Some of the factors impacting discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, wages and employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth based on recent severe market declines, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. 7 Table of Contents The recent global financial crisis has broadened and intensified, reaching unprecedented levels. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. The downturn in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our merchandise and adversely impact our results of operations and continued growth. It is difficult to predict how long the current economic, capital and credit market conditions will continue and what impact they will have on our business. The global economic crisis could have a material adverse effect on the Companys liquidity and capital resources The recent distress in the financial markets has resulted in extreme volatility in security prices and diminished liquidity and credit availability, and there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. Although we believe that cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity through the current credit crisis, tightening of the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities. Our Credit Facility also has financial covenants which, if not met, may lead our lender to terminate the agreement. In addition, the current credit crisis is having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world, and the impact of this crisis on our major suppliers cannot be predicted. The inability of key suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to delivery delays or failures. We have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. With the current financial environment and the instability of financial institutions, we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our deposits. Fluctuation in our level of sales and earnings growth and stock price A variety of factors has historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable stores sales results and profit margins. These factors include fashion trends and client preferences, changes in our merchandise mix, competition, economic conditions, weather, effective inventory management and new store openings. There is no assurance that we will achieve positive levels of sales and earnings growth, and any decline in our future growth or performance could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Our stock price has experienced, and could continue to experience in the future, substantial volatility as a result of many factors, including recent global economic conditions, broad market fluctuations and public perception of the prospects for the womens apparel industry. Failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to comparable store sales, net revenues, operating margins and earnings per share, would likely result in a decline in the market price of our stock. Our ability to achieve the results of our restructuring program In January 2008, we announced a multi-year, strategic, restructuring program as part of a major drive to enhance profitability and improve overall operating effectiveness, which we expanded in Fiscal 2008. The key elements of our restructuring program include optimization of our store portfolio, organizational streamlining and a broad-based productivity initiative. The benefits associated with our restructuring program are based on forecasts, which may vary materially based on various factors, including the timing in execution of our restructuring program; outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties; inventory levels; and changes in managements assumptions and projections. As a result of these events and circumstances, delays and unexpected costs may occur, which could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of our restructuring program or in such benefits taking longer to achieve than expected. Further, to the extent we are unable to improve our financial performance, further restructuring measures may be required in the future. 8 Table of Contents Our ability to grow through new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions and manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores Our continued growth and success depends in part on our ability to open and operate new stores, expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis, and optimize store performance by closing under-performing stores. Accomplishing our store expansion goals, which involve opening fewer stores in Fiscal 2009 than in the past several years, depends upon a number of factors, including locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms. We must also be able to effectively renew and re-negotiate terms in existing store leases. Hiring and training qualified associates, particularly at the store management level, and maintaining overall good relations with our associates, is also important to our store operations. There is no assurance that we will achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively or operate our stores profitably. Our ability to maintain the value of our brands Our success depends on the value of our Ann Taylor and LOFT brands. The Ann Taylor and LOFT names are integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brands will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising, and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality client experience. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives for one or both of these brands and our public image and reputation could be tarnished by negative publicity. Any of these events could negatively impact sales. Our reliance on foreign sources of production We purchase a significant portion of our merchandise from foreign suppliers. As a result, we are subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as:  imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the quantity of our merchandise that may be imported into the United States from countries in regions where we do business;  significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations;  imposition of duties, taxes, and other charges on imports;  imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duties in response to an investigation as to whether a particular product being sold in the United States at less than fair value may cause (or threaten to cause) material injury to the relevant domestic industry;  financial or political instability in any of the countries in which our merchandise is manufactured;  impact of natural disasters and public health concerns on our foreign sourcing offices and vendor manufacturing operations;  fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds;  potential recalls for any merchandise that does not meet our quality standards; and  disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices. We cannot predict whether any of the foreign countries in which our merchandise is manufactured, or in which our merchandise may be manufactured in the future, will be subject to import restrictions by the U.S. government. Any sudden disruption of manufacturing or imposition of trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or more restrictive quotas on apparel or other items we sell could affect the import of such merchandise and could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, the raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high demand for fabrics, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. Increases in the demand for, or the price of, raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or our ability to meet our clients needs. We may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher raw material costs onto our clients, which could negatively impact our profitability. 9 Table of Contents Our reliance on third party manufacturers We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend on independent third parties to manufacture our merchandise. We cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with merchandise specifications, insufficient quality control and failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. In addition, as a result of recent credit market events, our suppliers may be unable to obtain adequate credit or access liquidity to finance their operations. A manufacturers failure to ship merchandise to us on a timely basis or to meet the required product safety and quality standards could cause supply shortages, failure to meet client expectations and damage to our brands, which could result in lost sales. Manufacturer compliance with our social practices requirements We require our independent manufacturers to comply with the Ann Taylor Global Supplier Principles and Guidelines and monitor their compliance with these guidelines using third-party monitoring firms. Although we have an active program to provide training for our independent manufacturers and monitor their compliance with our labor standards, we do not control the manufacturers or their labor practices. Any failure of the manufacturer to comply with our Global Supplier Principles and Guidelines, local labor laws in the country of manufacture or divergence of a manufacturers labor practices from those generally acceptable as ethical in the United States could disrupt the shipment of finished product to us, force us to locate alternative manufacturing sources, reduce demand for our merchandise or damage our reputation. Our reliance on key management Our success depends to a significant extent both upon the continued services of our current executive and senior management team, as well as our ability to attract, hire, motivate and retain additional qualified management in the future. Competition for key executives in the retail industry is intense, and our operations could be adversely affected if we cannot attract and retain qualified associates. Our ability to successfully upgrade and maintain our information systems to support the needs of the organization We rely heavily on information systems to manage our operations, including a full range of retail, financial, sourcing and merchandising systems, and regularly make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace these systems. The reliability and capacity of our information systems is critical. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses, power outages and other technical malfunctions. Any disruptions affecting our information systems, or any delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or in integrating them with current systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business. Any failure to maintain adequate system security controls to protect our computer assets and sensitive data, including client data, from unauthorized access, disclosure or use could also damage our reputation with our clients. In addition, our ability to continue to operate our business without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends in part on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Our dependence on a single distribution facility We handle merchandise distribution for all of our stores from a single facility in Louisville, Kentucky. Independent third party transportation companies deliver our merchandise to our stores and our clients. Any significant interruption in the operation of the distribution facility or the domestic transportation infrastructure due to natural disasters, accidents, inclement weather, system failures, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by employees of the transportation companies, or other unforeseen causes could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores, which could result in lower sales, a loss of loyalty to our brands and excess inventory. 10 Table of Contents Risks associated with Internet sales We sell merchandise over the Internet through our websites, www.anntaylor.com and www.anntaylorloft.com. Our Internet operations are subject to numerous risks, including:  reliance on third party computer hardware/software and order fulfillment providers;  rapid technological change;  diversion of sales from our stores;  liability for online content;  violations of state or federal laws, including those relating to online privacy;  credit card fraud;  risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate our websites and their related support systems, including computer viruses; and  telecommunications failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. There is no assurance that our Internet operations will continue to achieve sales and profitability growth. Our ability to execute brand extensions and new concepts Part of our business strategy is to grow our existing brands and identify and develop new growth opportunities. In Fiscal 2008, we continued to invest in factory channel expansion with the launch of our LOFT Outlet concept. Our success with new merchandise offerings or concepts requires significant capital expenditures and management attention. Any such plan is subject to risks such as client acceptance, competition, product differentiation, challenges to economies of scale in merchandise sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified associates, including management and designers. There is no assurance that these merchandise offerings or concepts will be successful or that our overall profitability will increase as a result. Our failure to successfully execute our growth strategies may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Effects of war, terrorism or other catastrophes Threat of terrorist attacks or actual terrorist events in the United States and worldwide could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, disrupt the production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise or lead to lower client traffic in regional shopping centers. Natural disasters could also impact our ability to open and run our stores in affected areas. Lower client traffic due to security concerns, war or the threat of war and natural disasters could result in decreased sales that would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, as well as applicable employment laws. Additional legal and regulatory requirements, such as those arising under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and various foreign laws, increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in damage to our reputation, financial condition and market price of our stock. Our ability to realize deferred tax assets If our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in managements determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate taxable income from operations and tax planning strategies. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. 11 Table of Contents The effect of external economic factors on our Pension Plan Our future funding obligations for our defined benefit Pension Plan qualified with the Internal Revenue Service depend upon the future performance of assets set aside for this Pension Plan, interest rates used to determine funding levels, actuarial data and experience and any changes in government laws and regulations. In addition, the Pension Plan holds a significant amount of mutual funds which invest in equity securities. If the market values of these securities decline, our pension expenses would increase and, as a result, could materially adversely affect our business. Decreases in interest rates that are not offset by contributions and asset returns could also increase our obligations under such Pension Plan. We may be legally required to make contributions to our Pension Plan in the future, and those contributions could be material. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. 12 Table of Contents
