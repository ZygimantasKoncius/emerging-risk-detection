A reconciliation of operating results to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) is included in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 18 of this Annual Report. Revenue Recognition Revenues from product sales and manufacturing revenue are recognized at the time of shipment and a provision is made at that time for estimated future credits, chargebacks, sales discounts, and returns. These sales provision accruals are presented as an increase in accounts payable balances. The Company continually monitors the adequacy of the accruals by comparing the actual payments to the estimates used in establishing the accruals. The Company ships product to customers primarily FOB and utilizes the following criteria to determine appropriate revenue recognition: pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, selling price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Sales terms are generally 30 days. Royalties under license agreements with third parties are recognized when earned through the sale of the product by the licensor net of any estimated future credits, charge-backs, sales discounts and refunds. Inventory Adjustments Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company reviews the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. The likelihood of any material inventory write-downs is dependent on rapid changes in customer demand or new product introductions by competitors. Research and development expenses The directors do not consider the development programs to be sufficiently advanced to reliably determine the economic benefits and technical feasibility to justify capitalisation of development costs. These costs have been recognised as an expense when incurred. Share-based payment transactions The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined using a binomial model, using the assumptions detailed in Note 10. 37 Impairments The Group assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group that may lead to impairment of assets. Where an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. Value-in-use calculations performed in assessing recoverable amounts incorporate a number of key estimates. Results of Operations The following table provides a summary of revenues and expenses to supplement the more detailed discussions below: INCOME STATEMENTS for the year ended June 30, 2006 Notes 2006 2005 2006 A$000 A$000 US$000 Continuing Operations Revenue 2 13,500 13,404 10,021 Cost of sales (5,445 ) (4,666 ) (4,042 ) Gross profit 8,055 8,738 5,979 Other income 2 4,738 4,274 3,517 Research & development expenses (12,014 ) (10,217 ) (8,918 ) Selling & promotional expenses (9,013 ) (8,411 ) (6,690 ) Shipping and handling expenses (556 ) (444 ) (413 ) General and administrative expenses (8,769 ) (6,566 ) (6,509 ) Other Expenses (301 )  (223 ) Finance costs (52 ) (56 ) (39 ) Loss before income tax 2 (17,912 ) (12,682 ) (13,296 ) Income tax expense 3 (1 ) (2 ) (1 ) Loss for the period (17,913 ) (12,684 ) (13,297 ) Loss attributable to minority interest 1,693 1,152 1,257 Loss attributable to members of Novogen Limited (16,220 ) (11,532 ) (12,040 ) 38 Operating Results  Fiscal 2006 v Fiscal 2005 Revenue The Group earned gross revenues for the year ended June 30, 2006 of $18.2 million versus $17.7 million in the previous corresponding period, an increase of $0.5 million. The increase in revenue was due to increased sales of the Companys consumer products which were $13.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2006 compared with $13.4 million for the previous year, an increase of $0.1 million or 1%. Other income increased by $0.4 million to $4.7 million verses $4.3 million for the previous corresponding period. The increase in Other income was mainly due to increased government grant income through the Pharmaceutical Partnership Program and an increase of A$0.5 million in revenue received from litigation settlements from our consumer products patent defence activities. Total revenue, adjusted for U.S. GAAP, remained constant at A$15.9 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005. Revenue under U.S. GAAP is reduced by certain trade promotions which are treated as discounts to Sales Revenue. These trade promotion expenditures are treated as a marketing expense under AIFRS. Other Revenue under U.S. GAAP is also reduced by interest revenue being recognized in Other Income whereas under AIFRS interest income is recognized in Other Operating Revenue. See Note 24 Differences between AIFRS and U.S. GAAP for detailed U.S. GAAP formatted Statement of Financial Performance. Consumer product sales Sales in Australasia for the year ended June 30, 2006 were $5.2 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 13% from $4.6 million for the previous year. Sales in North America were, $5.7 million, a reduction of $0.5 million or 8% from $6.2 million for the previous year. Sales in Europe of $2.6 million for the year were up slightly by $0.1 million from $2.5 million for the previous corresponding period. During the financial year, the consumer business launched three new product introductions into selected markets including Promensil Post Menopause into the U.S. market in September 2005, Promensil After Menopause in Canada in January 2006 and a Promensil menopause test in Australia in March 2006. These products will be launched progressively into other markets and are targeted to augment the Promensil brand by extending the market to include an after menopause product and menopause test to help women diagnose the symptoms of menopause. Sales levels of our consumer products in Australia, Canada and to a lesser extent in Europe, have continued to benefit from our targeted promotional programs. Sales in the U.S. market were affected by the market decline in the natural menopause product market of 18%. This decline was due to reduced advertising and sales and marketing effort across the sector and increased competition from hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products which appear to be regaining some of the markets which were 39 impacted by the recent controversies surrounding safety issues. In October 2006, the Company licensed the U.S. rights to Promensil and Trinovin brands to Natrol, Inc. The Company will continue to position its products as the most clinically trialled natural alternatives in the menopause market. Costs and Expenses Total expenses before interest and tax increased by $5.8 million to $36.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2006 from $30.3 million for the previous year. Cost of sales increased by $0.8 million, reflecting lower production volumes. Selling and promotional expenses increased by $0.6 million to $9.0 million. The increase was associated with the expenses incurred to fund new product launches and to continue our targeted promotional program. Research and development expenses were $12.0 million, an increase of $1.8 million from $10.2 million for the same period last year, reflecting the costs associated with progressing the pre-clinical and clinical development program including the anti-cancer program being conducted by MEI and manufacturing scale-up costs associated with phenoxodiol. General and administrative expenses were $8.8 million an increase of $2.2 million from $6.6 million for the same period last year. The increased costs included the costs associated with the withdrawn registration statement for Glycotex, Inc. of $1.0 million, $0.2 million increase in share based payments to employees and consultants and increases in other corporate costs. Net loss The operating loss attributable to Novogen shareholders for the fiscal year, after allowing for losses attributable to minority interests of $1.7 million, increased by $4.7 million to $16.2 million from a loss of $11.5 million for the previous year. The net loss from ordinary activities after income tax for the consolidated group for the year ended June 30, 2006 increased by $5.2 million to $17.9 million from $12.7 million for the previous year. The increase in the Companys net loss for the year ended June 30, 2006 was due to higher cost of goods due to reduced production volumes, higher sales and marketing expenditure, increased research and development costs and additional administration and general expenses. The increased loss was partly offset by an increase in sales and other revenues. Liquidity and capital resources The Company has continued to finance its operations from equity capital. At June 30, 2006, the Company had cash balances of A$33.5 million, a decrease of A$13.8 million from the previous years balance of A$47.3 million. Cash was used to fund the Companys operations including the clinical trial program for the anti-cancer drug phenoxodiol, being undertaken by MEI. Cash resources were also used to fund the ongoing efforts in the areas of cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory research and development. Cash was also used to supplement the cash flows from the consumer 40 products business and general corporate purposes. At June 30, 2006 the Company held cash balances in U.S. dollars of US$13.2 million. Marshall Edwards, Inc. post balance date capital raising On July 11, 2006, MEI entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors providing for the placement of 6,329,311 shares of its common stock and warrants exercisable for 2,215,258 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of US$2.90 per unit (PIPE). The warrants have an exercise price of US$4.35 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The warrants may be exercised no less than six months from the closing date and will expire four years from the date of issuance, or July 11, 2010. MEI closed the private placement on July 11, 2006. In conection with the PIPE the Company received proceeds of US$16.9 million net of US$1.5 million commissions and other costs. On July 11, 2006, MEI entered into a standby equity distribution agreement (SEDA), with Cornell Capital Partners, LP. Under the SEDA, MEI may issue and sell to Cornell shares of its common stock for a total purchase price of up to US$15 million, once a resale registration statement is in effect. MEI has sole discretion whether and when to sell shares of its common stock to Cornell. Cornell will be irrevocably bound to purchase shares of common stock from MEI after MEI sends a notice that it intends to sell shares of common stock to Cornell. Each advance under the SEDA is limited to a maximum of US$1.5 million. Management does not believe that it will access the SEDA until 2007. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents in interest bearing facilities with various maturity dates. At the end of fiscal 2006, deposits amounting to A$12.1 million had a weighted average interest rate of 5.78% and cash deposits of A$21.4 million had a weighted average interest rate of 3.65%. At the end of fiscal 2006, the Company had outstanding interest bearing liabilities in the form of lease liabilities of A$0.1 million. These leases have an average lease term of 4 years. The average interest rate implicit in the leases is 7.75% as compared to 8.33% in fiscal 2005. The Company has arranged finance lease facilities with St George Bank Limited, an Australian commercial bank, of A$4.0 million, of which A$3.4 million was unused at the end of fiscal 2006. The Company does not hedge its foreign exchange exposures. The Company, however, continues to minimise foreign exchange risk by having international sales and marketing expenses being denominated in local currencies. See Item 11 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Foreign Currency Risk. During fiscal 2006, the Company had net cash outflows from operating activities of A$14.4 million. Included in this amount are cash receipts of A$1.5 million of interest received from invested cash balances, A$1.3 million from the proceeds of government 41 grants being primarily the Pharmaceutical Partnerships Program grants for research and development and A$1.2 million royalty received from ADM pursuant to a license agreement between the Company and PTI.
