Item 1A. Risk Factors This document includes statements that may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as "may", "will", "expect", "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", and "continue" or similar words. You should consider all statements other than historical information or current facts to be forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements may contain projections regarding our revenues, earnings, operations, and other financial projections, and may include statements of our future performance, strategies and objectives. However, there may be events in the future which we are not able to accurately predict or control which may cause our actual results to differ, possib ly materially, from the expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed as a result of various factors. Such factors include, among others, market risk, credit risk and operating risk. These and other risks are set forth in greater detail below and elsewhere in this document. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update any of our forward-looking statements. You should carefully consider the risk factors described below in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference in this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. These risk factors are intended to highlight some factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion. Like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the United States or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community, and other factors beyond ou r control. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. Company Risks We have incurred losses in recent periods and may incur losses in the future. We have incurred losses in recent periods. We recorded a net loss of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and a net loss of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We have experienced declines in revenues generated by several of our key segments, including equities sales and trading, equity investment banking and fixed income sales and trading. We may incur losses and further declines in revenue in future periods. Historically, we have financed most of our losses through asset sales and the incurrence of debt. If we continue to incur losses and we are unable to raise funds to finance those losses, they could have a significant effect on our liquidity as well as our ability to operate. In addition, we may incur significant expenses if we expand our underwriting and trading businesses or engage in strategic acquisitions and investments. Accordingly, we will need to increase our revenues at a rate greater than our expenses to achieve and maintain profitability. If our revenues do not increase sufficiently, or we are unable to manage our expenses, we will not achieve and maintain profitability in future periods. We have a significant amount of debt coming due within the next 90 days. In March 2006, we entered into a loan agreement to borrow up to $11 million, of which we initially borrowed $8.7 million. We used these funds, along with other available funds, to repay our $10 million Senior Notes dated June 13, 2003 (see Short-Term Bank Loans and Notes Payable note of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding the Senior Notes). The maturity date for this new loan is June 15, 2006. We are also obligated to repay an additional $5 million of debt on or prior to June 15, 2006 related primarily to our $4.9 million Term Loan. We will be unable to repay these amounts out of cash from our operations and therefore will need to refinance this debt or take other actions, such as selling assets. We cannot be assured that any such financing would be available on acceptable terms or that asset sales could be ac complished in a manner acceptable to us. In addition, upon expiration of a lock-up agreement to which we are a party (refer to Investments note in the Consolidated Financial Statements), this new loan will be collateralized by shares of common stock that we own of iRobot Corporation. If the daily market value of these shares decreases to a level that causes the outstanding loan amount to exceed 30% of the collateral value, we must pledge additional collateral to the bank, either in cash or other specified securities, which, if held by a broker-dealer subsidiary, may require regulatory approval. Although we do not anticipate experiencing any difficulty in obtaining such approval, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are required to provide this additional collateral from our broker-dealer subsidiaries, this could adversely affect our ability to operate our businesses. Our ability to retain our senior professionals and hire new senior management is critical to the success of our business. In order to operate our business successfully, we rely heavily on our senior professionals. Their personal reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and project execution skills are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagements. We encounter intense competition for qualified employees from other companies in the investment banking industry as well as from businesses outside the investment banking industry, such as hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds. In the past we have lost investment banking, brokerage, research and other professionals and could lose more in the future, which could impair our ability to secure or successfully complete engagements. If we lose a significant number of our key professionals, we may have to hire additional personnel. At that time, th ere could be a shortage of qualified and, in some cases, licensed personnel whom we could hire. This could hinder our ability to expand or cause a backlog in our ability to conduct our business, including the handling of investment banking transactions and the processing of brokerage orders. These personnel challenges could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. First Albany has committed to enter into various agreements to retain certain of its employees, including retention agreements in an amount aggregating $7.5 million, which are payable in July 2006 to the extent the employee is still employed by First Albany Capital and/or its affiliates. We cannot assure you that these employees will remain in the employ of First Albany Capital and/or its affiliates either as a result of these agreements or after they have received this payment. In addition, in the past year we have had several changes in our senior management, including the departure of our chief financial officer and our general counsel. In addition, in August 2005 we announced our succession planning for the position of chief executive officer and our formal commencement of a search process to identify candidates for that position. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully hire individuals to fill these positions who will work together effectively to successfully develop and implement our business strategies and operations. We will incur charges if we move our New York City offices into recently leased space. In 2005, we entered into a lease for new office space in New York City. The leases for our current office spaces in New York City expire in October 2008 and May 2009. As part of our effort to reduce expenses, we have entered into discussions with a third party to take over the lease for the new space. If these discussions are unsuccessful, we will move our New York City operations into the new office space. If we do move our New York City offices, our ongoing lease expenses will increase and we will incur additional charges (net of anticipated sublease rental income) arising out of our vacating our current office spaces. (See Commitments and Contingencies note of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding our leases). Limitations on our access to capital could impair our liquidity and our ability to conduct our businesses. Liquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to financial services firms. Failures of financial institutions have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity. Liquidity is of particular importance to our trading business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our clients and counterparties willingness to engage in brokerage transactions with us. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading clients, third parties or us. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time. Our private equity business and investment portfolio may also create liquidity risk due to increased levels of investments in high-risk, illiquid assets. We have made substantial principal investments in our private equity funds and may make additional investments in future funds, which are typically made in securities that are not publicly traded. There is a significant risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy. In particular, these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made, changes in national or international economic conditions or changes in laws, regulations, fiscal policies or political conditions of countries in which investments are made. It takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportuni ties and then to realize the cash value of our investments through resale. Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable, it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash. First Albany Capital and Descap, our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to the net capital requirements of the SEC and various self-regulatory organizations of which they are members. These requirements typically specify the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also mandate that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Any failure to comply with these net capital requirements could impair our ability to conduct our core business as a brokerage firm. Furthermore, First Albany Capital and Descap are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from it to First Albany Companies Inc. As a holding company, First Albany Companies Inc. depends on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to support the funding of dividend payments and debt obligations. As a result, regulatory actions could impede First Albany Companies Inc.s access to funds. In ad dition, because First Albany Companies Inc. holds equity interests in the firms subsidiaries, its rights may be subordinated to the claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries. We focus principally on specific sectors of the economy, and a deterioration in the business environment in these sectors generally or decline in the market for securities of companies within these sectors could materially adversely affect our businesses. For example, our equity business focuses principally on the healthcare, energy and technology sectors of the economy. Therefore, volatility in the business environment in these sectors generally, or in the market for securities of companies within these sectors particularly, could substantially affect our financial results and the market value of our common stock. The market for securities in each of our target sectors may also be subject to industry-specific risks. Underwriting transactions, strategic advisory engagements and related trading activities in our target sectors represent a significant portion of our businesses. This concentration exposes us to the risk of substantial declines in r evenues in the event of downturns in these sectors of the economy and any future downturns in our target sectors could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Increase in capital commitments in our trading, underwriting and other businesses increases the potential for significant losses. The trend in capital markets is toward larger and more frequent commitments of capital by financial services firms in many of their activities. For example, in order to win business, investment banks are increasingly committing to purchase large blocks of stock from publicly-traded issuers or their significant shareholders, instead of the more traditional marketed underwriting process, in which marketing was typically completed before an investment bank committed to purchase securities for resale. As a result, we may be subject to increased risk as we commit greater amounts of capital to facilitate primarily client-driven business. Furthermore, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry. We may enter into large transactions in which we commit our own capital as part of our trading business. The number and size of these large transactions may materially affect our results of operations in a given period. We may also incur significant losses from our trading activities due to market fluctuations and volatility from quarter to quarter. We maintain trading positions in the fixed income and equity markets to facilitate client trading activities. To the extent that we own security positions, in any of those markets, a downturn in the value of those securities or in those markets could result in losses from a decline in value. Conversely, to the extent that we have sold securities we do not own in any of those markets, an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially unlimited losses as we attempt to acquire the securities in a rising market. Our principal trading and investments expose us to risk of loss. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from trading in which we act as principal. Although the majority of our principal trading is riskless principal in nature, we may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of municipal, corporate, asset-backed and equity securities for our own account and from other principal trading. In any period, we may experience losses as a result of price declines, lack of trading volume, and illiquidity. From time to time, we may engage in a large block trade in a single security or maintain large position concentrations in a single security, securities of a single issuer, or securities of issuers engaged in a specific industry. In general, because our inventory is marked to market on a weekly basis, any downward price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our reven ues and profits. In addition, we may engage in hedging transactions and strategies that may not properly mitigate losses in our principal positions. If the transactions and strategies are not successful, we could suffer significant losses. Our financial results may fluctuate substantially from period to period, which may impact our stock price. We have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, significant periodic variations in our revenues and results of operations. These variations may be attributed in part to fluctuations in the value of our investment portfolio and the fact that our investment banking revenues are typically earned upon the successful completion of a transaction, the timing of which is uncertain and beyond our control. In most cases we receive little or no payment for investment banking engagements that do not result in the successful completion of a transaction. As a result, our business is highly dependent on market conditions as well as the decisions and actions of our clients and interested third parties. If the parties fail to complete a transaction on which we are advising or an offering in which we are participating, we will earn little or no revenue from the transaction. This risk may be intensified by our focus on growth companies in the healthcare, energy and technology sectors, as the market for securities of these companies has experienced significant variations in the number and size of equity offerings as well as the after-market trading volume and prices of newly issued securities. Recently, more companies initiating the process of an initial public offering are simultaneously exploring merger and acquisition exit opportunities. If we are not engaged as a strategic advisor in any such dual-tracked process, our investment banking revenues would be adversely affected in the event that an initial public offering is not consummated. In addition, our investments in our private equity funds are adjusted for accounting purposes to fair value at the end of each quarter and our allocable share of these gains or losses will affect our revenues even when these market fluctuations have no cash impact, which could increase the volatility of our quarte rly earnings. As a result, we are unlikely to achieve steady and predictable earnings on a quarterly basis, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price. For more information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Pricing and other competitive pressures may impair the revenues and profitability of our brokerage business. In recent years we have experienced significant pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in debt and equity trading. In the fixed income market, regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency, leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins. In the equity market, we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions, and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading, which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins. The trend toward using alternative trading systems is continuing to grow, which may result in decreased commission and trading revenue, reduce our participation in the trading markets and our ability to access market information, and lead to the creation of new and stronger competitors. Institutional clients also have pressured financial services firms to alter soft dollar practices under which brokerage firms bundle the cost of trade execution with research products and services, and the SEC is considering additional rulemaking in the soft dollar area. Some institutions are entering into arrangements that separate (or unbundle) payments for research products or services from sales commissions. These arrangements have increased the competitive pressures on sales commissions and have affected the value our clients place on high-quality research. Additional pressure on sales and trading revenue may impair the profitability of our brokerage business. Moreover, our inability to reach agreement regarding the terms of unbundling arrangements with institutional clients who are actively seeking such arrangements could result in the loss of those clients, which would likely reduce our institutional commissions. We bel ieve that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay, including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use, and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees, commissions or margins. Difficult market conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways. Difficult market and economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business and profitability in many ways. Weakness in equity markets and diminished trading volume of securities could adversely impact our brokerage business. Industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions also would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues. In addition, reductions in the trading prices for equity securities also tend to reduce the deal value of investment banking transactions, such as underwriting and mergers and acquisitions transactions, which in turn may reduce the fees we earn from these transactions. As we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly, our profits and profit margins may decline. We face strong competition from larger firms. The brokerage and investment banking industries are intensely competitive and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including client relationships, reputation, the abilities of our professionals, market focus and the relative quality and price of our services and products. We have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses, in particular discounts in large block trades and trading commissions and spreads. In addition, pricing and other competitive pressures in investment banking, including the trends toward multiple book runners, co-managers and multiple financial advisors handling transactions, have continued and could adversely affect our revenues, even as the volume and number of investment banking transactions have started to increase. We believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of ou r competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price. We are a small investment bank with 388 employees and net revenues of $166.1 million in 2005. Many of our competitors in the brokerage and investment banking industries have a broader range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, more professionals to serve their clients needs, greater global reach and more established relationships with clients than we have. These larger and better capitalized competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the brokerage and investment banking industries, to compete for skilled professionals, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally. The scale of our competitors has increased in recent years as a result of substantial consolidation among companies in the brokerage and investment banking industries. In addition, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other broad-based financial services firms have established or acquired underwriting or financial advisory practices and broker-dealers or have merged with other financial institutions. These firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we do, which may enhance their competitive position. They also have the ability to support investment banking with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services in an effort to gain market share, which has resulted, and could further result, in pricing pressure in our businesses. In particular, the ability to provide financing has become an important advantage for some of our larger competitors and, because we do not provide such financing, we may be unable t o compete as effectively for clients in a significant part of the brokerage and investment banking market. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk. Our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure, breach of contract or other reasons. We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. As a self-clearing firm, we finance our customer positions and could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers. Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us. If any of the variety of instruments, processes and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. Our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across diverse markets, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. Our financial, accounting or other data processing systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liabil ity to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. We also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and to manage our exposure to risk. In addition, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business, whether due to fire, other natural disaster, power or communications failure, act of terrorism or war or otherwise. Nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including New York, Albany, San Francisco and Boston, work in close proximity to each other. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer and we may not be able to implement successfully contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. Our operations also rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients, our counterparties or third parties operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business. We expect the growth of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions and strategic partnering. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that our financial controls, the level and knowledge of our personnel, our operational abilities, our legal and compliance controls and our other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and our growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, as we acquire new businesses, we face numerous risks and uncertainties integrating their controls and systems into ours, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adv ersely affect our business and prospects. Risks Related to Our Industry Financial services firms have been subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years, increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions. Firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment. The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, including the SEC, the NYSE, the NASD and state attorneys general. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years. This regulatory and enforcement environment has created uncertainty with respect to a number of transactions that had historically been entered into by financial services firms and that were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate. We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulator y organizations. We also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other United States or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. Among other things, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business prospects. In addition, financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts. The SEC and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts and regularly seek to review and update our policies, controls and procedures. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. Our policies and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts may also result in increased costs, additional operational personnel and increased regulatory risk. Failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation. Risks associated with regulatory impact on capital markets. Highly-publicized financial scandals in recent years have led to investor concerns over the integrity of the U.S. financial markets, and have prompted Congress, the SEC, the NYSE and Nasdaq to significantly expand corporate governance and public disclosure requirements. To the extent that private companies, in order to avoid becoming subject to these new requirements, decide to forgo initial public offerings, our equity underwriting business may be adversely affected. In addition, provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the corporate governance rules imposed by self-regulatory organizations have diverted many companies attention away from capital market transactions, including securities offerings and acquisition and disposition transactions. In particular, companies that are or are planning to be public are incurring significant expenses in complying with the SEC an d accounting standards relating to internal control over financial reporting, and companies that disclose material weaknesses in such controls under the new standards may have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets. These factors, in addition to adopted or proposed accounting and disclosure changes, may have an adverse effect on our business. Our business is subject to significant credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses, we are involved in the execution, settlement and financing of various customer and principal securities and commodities transactions. These activities are transacted on a cash, margin or delivery-versus-payment basis and are subject to the risk of counterparty or customer nonperformance. Although transactions are generally collateralized by the underlying security or other securities, we still face the risks associated with changes in the market value of the collateral through settlement date or during the time when margin is extended. We may also incur credit risk in our derivative transactions to the extent such transactions result in uncollateralized credit exposure to our counterparties. We seek to control the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily. We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return collateral pledged. In the case of aged securities failed to receive, we may, under industry regulations, purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty. Our exposure to legal liability is significant, and damages that we may be required to pay and the reputational harm that could result from legal action against us could materially adversely affect our businesses. We face significant legal risks in our businesses and, in recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing. These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions, potential liability for fairness opinions and other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements. We are also subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment, among other things. These ri sks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. As a brokerage and investment banking firm, we depend to a large extent on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with our services, it may be more damaging in our business than in other businesses. Moreover, our role as advisor to our clients on important underwriting or mergers and acquisitions transactions involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment, including rendering fairness opinions in connection with mergers and other transactions. Therefore, our activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and aggrieved third parties, including shareholders of our clients who could bring securities class actions against us. Our investment banking engagements typically include broad indemnities from our clients and provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services, b ut these provisions may not protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. As a result, we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against litigation and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements and adverse judgments. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business and prospects. Employee misconduct could harm us and is difficult to detect and deter. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur at our Company. For example, misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases, and we may suffer significant reputational harm for any misconduct by our employees.
