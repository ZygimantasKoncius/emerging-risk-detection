Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks. Our business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond our control. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these factors. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Highly competitive markets for our products and industry consolidation may create increased pricing pressures. The printing industry is extremely competitive. In the book manufacturing segment, consolidation over the past few years of both customers and competitors within the markets the Company competes has caused downward pricing pressures. In addition, excess capacity and competition from printing companies in lower cost countries may increase competitive pricing pressures. Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater sales, assets and financial resources than us and others, particularly those in foreign countries, may derive significant advantages from local governmental regulation, including tax holidays and other subsidies. All or any of these competitive pressures could affect prices or customers demand for our products, impacting our profit margins 5 and/or resulting in a loss of customers and market share. We have a high degree of customer concentration. We derived approximately 35% of our 2007 revenues, 40% of our 2006 revenues, and 47% of our 2005 revenues from two major customers. A significant reduction in order volumes or price levels from either of them could have a material adverse effect on the Company. We need to keep pace with rapid industry and technological change. The printing industry is in a period of rapid technological evolution. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, upon the ability to anticipate and adapt to rapid industry and technological changes occurring in the industry and upon the ability to offer, on a timely basis, services that meet evolving industry standards. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to adapt to such technological changes or offer these services on a timely basis or establish or maintain a competitive position. We are unable to predict which of the many possible future product and service offerings will be important to establish and maintain competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these products and services. We cannot assure investors that one or more of these factors will not vary unpredictably, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we cannot assure investors, even if these factors turn out as we anticipate, that we will be able to implement our strategy or that the strategy will be successful in this rapidly evolving market. Our operating results are dependent in part on unpredictable order patterns. Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Factors that may affect our future operating results include:  the timing and size of the orders for our books;  the availability of markets for sales to our largest customer;  the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles associated with sales of textbooks to the elementary and high school market;  our customers willingness and success in shifting orders from the busy textbook season to even out our press load over the year;  fluctuations in the currency market may make manufacturing in the United States more or less attractive and make equipment more or less expensive for us to purchase; and  issues that might arise from the integration of acquired entities or the inability to achieve expected results from such acquisitions. As a result of these and other factors, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance. In addition, the factors noted above may make it difficult for us to forecast and provide in a timely 6 manner public guidance (including updates to prior guidance) related to our projected financial performance. Furthermore, it is possible that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Fluctuations in the cost and availability of paper and other raw materials may cause disruption and impact margins. Purchases of paper and other raw materials represent a large portion of our costs. Historically, we have generally been able to pass on these cost increases to customers through higher prices. However, if we are unable to continue to pass on these increases or substitute a less expensive grade of paper, our margins and profits could be adversely affected. In addition, increases in the cost of paper and other materials may adversely impact our book manufacturing customers demand for products. Availability of paper is important to both the book manufacturing and specialty publishing segments of the Company. Although we generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies of paper, unexpected changes in the paper markets could result in a shortage of supply. If this were to occur in the future, it could cause disruption to the business or increase paper costs, adversely impacting either or both net sales or profits. Fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials could adversely affect operating costs or customer demand and thereby negatively impact our operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Energy costs and availability may negatively impact our financial results. Energy costs are incurred directly to run production equipment and facilities and indirectly through expenses such as freight and raw materials such as ink. In a competitive market environment, increases to these direct and indirect energy related costs might not be able to be passed through to customers through price increases or mitigated through other means. In such instances, increased energy costs could adversely impact operating costs or customer demand. In addition, interruption in the availability of energy could disrupt operations, adversely impacting operating results. We may not be able to continue to improve our operating efficiencies. Because the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, we must continue to improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our profitability. Although we have been able to expand our capacity, improve our productivity and reduce costs in the past, there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future. In addition, reducing operating costs in the future may require significant initial costs to reduce headcount, close or consolidate operations, or upgrade equipment and technology. 7 Protection of intellectual property rights critical to publishing segment. Certain of our publications are protected by copyright, primarily held in the Companys name. Such copyrights protect the Companys exclusive right to publish the work in the United States and in many other countries for specified periods. The ability of the Company to continue to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. The Companys operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. Declines in general economic conditions may adversely impact our business. Economic conditions have the potential to impact our financial results significantly. Within the book manufacturing and specialty publishing segments, a change in economic conditions can impact many areas of spending, including government, business and individual spending. Examples of the changes in spending that could affect our financial results include:  Fluctuations in federal or state government spending on education could lead to a corresponding decrease or increase in the demand for educational materials, which are produced in our book manufacturing segment and comprise a portion of our publishing products.  Consumer demand for books can be impacted by reductions in disposable income when costs such as electricity and gasoline reduce discretionary spending.  Changes in the housing market may impact the sale of Creative Homeowners products. These changes may adversely impact our business. The substitution of electronic delivery for printed materials may adversely affect our business. Electronic delivery of documents and data, including the online distribution and hosting of media content, offers alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents. Consumer acceptance of electronic delivery is uncertain, as is the extent to which consumers are replacing print materials with online hosted media content. To the extent that our customers accept these electronic alternatives, demand for our printed products may be adversely affected. Changes in postal rates and postal regulations may adversely impact our business. Postal costs are a significant component of our direct marketing cost structure and postal rate changes can influence the number of catalogs that we may mail. In addition, increased postal rates can impact the cost of delivering our products to customers. Either of these results could adversely affect consumer demand and results of operations. 8 Our facilities are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may subject us to liability or increase costs. We use various materials in our operations which contain substances considered hazardous or toxic under environmental laws. In addition, our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws relating to, among other things, air emissions, waste generation, handling, management and disposal, waste water treatment and discharge and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Permits are required for the operation of certain of our businesses and these permits are subject to renewal, modification and in some circumstances, revocation. Under certain environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (CERCLA, commonly referred to as Superfund), and similar state laws and regulations, we may be liable for costs and damages relating to soil and groundwater contamination at off-site disposal locations or at our own facilities. Future changes to environmental laws and regulations may give rise to additional costs or liabilities that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses. Over the last four years, we have completed three acquisitions, including Moore Langen and Creative Homeowner in fiscal year 2006 and REA in fiscal 2004, and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. We believe that these acquisitions provide strategic growth opportunities for the Company. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The challenges involved in successfully integrating acquisitions include:  we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further our business strategy, or that we overpaid for the company or assets, or that economic conditions have changed, all of which may result in a future impairment charge;  we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and may have difficulty retaining the customers and/or the key personnel of the acquired business;  we may have difficulty incorporating and integrating acquired technologies into our business;  our ongoing business and managements attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing diverse locations;  we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across locations;  an acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees of the acquired business or third parties; and  we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with technology and legal contingencies of the acquired business. 9 These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time. From time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time from our business as well as significant out-of-pocket costs. The consideration that we pay in connection with an acquisition could affect our financial results. If we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate such acquisitions. To the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock, including options or other rights, our existing stockholders may experience dilution in their share ownership in our company and their earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, large one-time write-offs and restructuring charges. They may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges. Any of these factors may materially and adversely affect our business and operations. Our ability to hire and train key executives and other qualified employees is crucial. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to retain our executive officers and key management personnel. Our business strategy also depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain employees who have relevant experience in the printing and publishing industries. There can be no assurance that we can continue to attract and retain the necessary talented employees, including executive officers and other key members of management. If that were to occur, it could adversely affect our business. We need skilled labor to manufacture our products. If we experience problems hiring and retaining skilled labor, our business may be negatively affected. The timely manufacture and delivery of our products requires an adequate supply of skilled labor, and the operating costs of our manufacturing facilities can be adversely affected by high turnover in skilled positions. Accordingly, our ability to increase sales, productivity and net earnings will be limited to a degree by our ability to employ the skilled laborers necessary to meet our requirements. Although our book manufacturing locations are geographically dispersed, individual locations may encounter strong competition with other manufacturers for skilled labor. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to efficiently operate our facilities. In addition, unions represent certain groups of employees at several of our locations, and periodically, contracts with those unions come up for renewal. The outcome of those negotiations could have an adverse affect on our operations at those locations. 10 Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting matters may result in additional expenses. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Stock Market, as well as new accounting pronouncements, are creating uncertainty and additional complexities for companies. To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we continue to invest resources to comply with evolving standards. This investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating and cost management activities. Item 1B.
