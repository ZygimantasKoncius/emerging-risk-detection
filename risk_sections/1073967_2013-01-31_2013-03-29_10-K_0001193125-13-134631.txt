ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Indebtedness Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations for potential acquisition opportunities, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the senior subordinated notes. As of January 31, 2013, our total indebtedness was $410.0 million. We are highly leveraged and our debt service costs are significant. Following the amendments of our senior secured credit agreement in March 2011 and April 2012, and our termination of the 2012 non-extended portion of the revolving credit commitment in September 2011, we have a $20.0 million committed source of credit available to us under the revolving credit facility of our senior secured credit agreement, of which the entire $20.0 million was unused and available to us as of January 31, 2013. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:  making it more difficult for us to make payments on the senior subordinated notes;  increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;  requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operating activities to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement, are at variable rates of interest;  restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and  limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our senior secured credit agreement contains specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests that we must satisfy in order to avoid an event of default under our debt agreements. Under our senior secured credit agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests is dependent upon our financial performance, which can be affected by events beyond our control. We have experienced declines in license and maintenance revenue in the recent past, which have been offset in part by decreases in costs. If our license or maintenance revenue continues to decline, and we are unable to grow our maintenance revenue or reduce our operating expenses, we may be unable to satisfy these ratios and tests. This would force us to seek a waiver or amendment with the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement, and no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments on satisfactory terms, if at all. The lenders would likely condition any waiver or amendment, if given, on additional consideration from us, such as a consent fee, a higher interest rate, principal repayment or more restrictive covenants and limitations on our business. A breach of any of these covenants, if not waived by the lenders, would result in a default under our senior secured credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit agreement, all amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement could be declared to be (or could automatically 10 Table of Contents become) immediately due and payable and all commitments to extend further credit could be terminated. In addition, a default under our senior secured credit agreement would result in a default under the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes, and all amounts outstanding under these notes could be declared immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior secured credit agreement. If the repayment of borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement is accelerated, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness under our senior secured credit agreement, as well as our unsecured indebtedness, including the senior subordinated notes. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;  pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or make other restricted payments;  make investments;  make capital expenditures;  create certain liens;  sell certain assets;  enter into agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend or other payments to us;  guarantee indebtedness;  engage in transactions with affiliates;  prepay, repurchase or redeem the senior subordinated notes;  create or designate unrestricted subsidiaries; and  consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 11 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business A decline or the continued uncertainty in global economic conditions could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Economic conditions, both domestically and abroad, directly affect our operating results. Current and future economic conditions, including such factors as consumer demand, unemployment and inflation levels, the availability of credit, and our customers financial condition, operating results and growth prospects may adversely affect our business and the results of our operations. The continued uncertainty in global economic conditions presents a variety of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the following:  the demand for our products and services, and IT spending generally, may decline as businesses postpone, reduce or cancel IT and other spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values or economic uncertainty;  our customers, distributors and resellers may choose to defer payments or fail to pay amounts owed to us, even though they may have no contractual right to do so;  prolonged economic uncertainty may increase the pricing pressure on our maintenance contract renewal business and could negatively affect our maintenance revenue in the future;  adverse economic conditions may promote consolidation in our customers industries as has occurred in the financial services industry in which many of our customers operate. Customer consolidation may lead to such adverse effects as reduced demand for our products and services by particular customers and within their industry more generally, greater pricing pressure and pressure to renegotiate existing contracts, replacement of our products in our installed base with competing products, and cancellations and reductions of previously planned customer purchases;  we may experience increased pricing competition for our products and services;  significant fluctuations and uncertainty about the future of currencies such as the Euro and the British Pound could negatively affect our revenues, specifically those derived internationally; and  the length of time that existing economic and financial market conditions may persist is unknown. In addition, although we do not anticipate needing additional capital in the near term due to our current financial position, financial market disruption may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital upon acceptable terms or at all. As of January 31, 2013, the committed source of credit available to us under our senior secured credit agreement was $20.0 million. If adverse global economic conditions persist, the foregoing risks could result in our failure to meet the financial covenants under our senior secured credit agreement. A breach of any of these financial covenants would result in a default under our senior secured credit agreement, in which event all outstanding amounts could be declared immediately due and payable. Any such acceleration would also result in a default under the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes. If repayment under our senior secured credit agreement is accelerated, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient assets or access to credit to repay our indebtedness or, if credit were available, that it would be upon acceptable terms. If management is unable to effectively forecast revenues and budget operating expenses, our business could be harmed. Our revenues, particularly our software license revenues, are difficult to forecast. Our sales personnel identify and monitor the status of qualified opportunities and proposals during a given quarter, such as the estimated date when a transaction will close and the potential dollar amount of the transaction. We aggregate these estimates in order to generate a quarterly sales forecast. While this analysis provides visibility to our 12 Table of Contents potential customers and the associated revenue, these estimates may not correlate to actual revenue in a particular quarter. A slowdown in the economy, domestically and internationally, has caused in the past and may cause in the future customer purchasing decisions to be delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled, all of which have reduced and could reduce the rate of conversion of the sales forecast into revenue contracts. In addition, primarily due to a substantial portion of our software licenses revenue contracts closing in the latter part of a quarter, management may be unable to proportionally reduce our operating expenses for that quarter in response to a shortfall in revenues, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected. Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process. We will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes, our ability to manage our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected. Our future revenue is substantially dependent upon our installed customer base renewing maintenance agreements for our products and licensing or upgrading additional Serena products; our future maintenance revenue is dependent on future sales of our software products and could decline. We depend on our installed customer base for future revenue from maintenance renewal fees and licenses or upgrades of additional products. Our maintenance revenue has declined in each of the past three years. If our customers do not purchase additional products, do not upgrade existing products or cancel or fail to renew their maintenance agreements or if they require us to discount our maintenance fees as part of renewing their maintenance agreements or the licensing of additional licensed capacity, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The terms of our standard license arrangements provide for a one-time license fee and a prepayment of one year of software maintenance and support fees. The maintenance agreements are renewable annually at the option of the customer, and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software. In addition, prolonged economic uncertainty has increased the pressure our customers are placing on maintenance renewals and pricing. We may also enter into enterprise license agreements with our customers, which generally result in reduced maintenance fees on a per unit basis due to the increased discounting of associated software license revenue or multi-year maintenance commitments, or both. Our maintenance revenue is dependent upon the continued use of maintenance by our installed customer base and our current installed customer base may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods. In addition, any downturn in our software license sales would have a negative impact on the growth of our professional service revenue and maintenance revenue in future periods. Our profitability is substantially dependent upon revenues derived from our mainframe software products. If revenues for our mainframe software products decline before we increase our revenues and margins derived from our distributed software products, our profitability may decline. The license and maintenance revenues from our mainframe software products generate significantly higher margins than our distributed software products. We expect that our future revenue growth will be derived from our distributed software products, primarily our application release management and DevOps solutions, and do not expect future revenue growth from our mainframe software products due to the maturity of this market. We experienced a decline in software license revenue from our mainframe software products and an associated decline in our profitability during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013. If revenues from our mainframe software products continue to decline faster than we generate increasing revenues and margins from our distributed software products, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 13 Table of Contents If our target markets do not evolve as we anticipate, our business will be adversely affected. If we fail to properly assess and address our target markets or if our products and services fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. With regard to the ALM market, IT organizations have historically addressed their ALM requirements with solutions developed internally. As ALM requirements have become more complex, IT organizations began to migrate to more sophisticated third-party ALM products. Our future financial performance will depend in large part on the continued growth in the number of businesses adopting third-party ALM products and the expansion of their use on a company-wide basis. In addition, we only recently began to offer products in application release management and application release automation markets and have significantly less experience with these markets than the ALM market. Since the markets for our products are still evolving, it is difficult to assess the competitive environment or the size of the market that may develop. Moreover, these markets may grow more slowly than we anticipate. In addition, technologies, customer requirements and industry standards may change rapidly. If we cannot improve or augment our products as rapidly as existing technologies, customer requirements and industry standards evolve, our products or services could become obsolete. The introduction of new or technologically superior products or SaaS offerings by new or existing competitors could also make our products less competitive or obsolete. As a result of any of these factors, our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded. If the market for IBM and IBM-compatible mainframes decreases, it could adversely affect our business. Our mainframe revenue is dependent upon the continued use and acceptance of IBM mainframes (including the periodic refresh by IBM of its mainframe offerings) and of IBM-compatible mainframes and the growth of this market. If the role of the mainframe does not increase as we anticipate, or if it decreases, this may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, if there is a wide acceptance of other platforms or if new platforms emerge that provide enhanced enterprise server capabilities, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, a significant portion of our software license revenue will continue to come from the sales of our mainframe products. As a result, future sales of our existing products and associated maintenance revenue and professional service revenue will depend on continued use of mainframes. If we fail to effectively manage our sales and marketing organizations, it could adversely affect our business. The loss of key sales or marketing employees could result in disruptions to our business and materially adversely affect our license revenue, operating results and financial condition. We have recently experienced significant turnover within our direct sales force, particularly within North America, which could result in reduced sales productivity, increased sales cycles and the delay or loss of business. If we are required to hire new sales and marketing employees in the future, a substantial amount of time and training is generally required before these personnel become productive. The hiring, training and integration of additional and replacement personnel would be time consuming, would likely increase our operating expenses and could cause disruptions to our business, which could materially adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition. If we fail to manage our sales and marketing organizations effectively, these organizations may fail to perform as we anticipate, which could materially adversely affect our license revenue and weaken our competitive position. Any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in significant fluctuations in our operating results. Our sales cycle typically takes three to eighteen months to complete and varies from product to product. Any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could result in significant fluctuations in our operating results. The length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control, including the size and complexity of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities. We have experienced an overall lengthening of sales cycles in the current economic environment as customers have more rigorously scrutinized potential IT purchases. Additionally, the 14 Table of Contents emerging market for our products and services contributes to the lengthy sales process in that during the sales cycle we often have to educate potential customers on the use and the benefits of our products. In certain circumstances, we license our software to customers on a trial basis to assist customers in their evaluation of our products. Our sales cycle can also be further extended for product sales made through third party distributors. Our industry changes rapidly due to evolving technology standards, and our future success will depend on our ability to continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers. Our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware, software, database and networking platforms particularly for our distributed systems products. We must develop and introduce enhancements to our existing products and new products on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments, evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements. We expect that we will have to respond quickly to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete. As a result, our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances. Our growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing applications, develop and introduce new applications that keep pace with technological advances, meet changing customer requirements and respond to competitive products. We expect that our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments, and we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments. If we are unable to successfully and timely develop our products due to development constraints, such as high employee turnover, lack of technical ability or lack of development resources, our products may fail to address these evolving customer requirements and become less competitive in our target markets. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to intense competition in our target markets, and we expect to face increased competition in the future, which could have an adverse effect on us. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and such inability would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The market for our products is highly competitive and diverse. Moreover, the technology for products in our target markets may change rapidly. New products are frequently introduced, and existing products are continually enhanced. Competition may also result in changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors, potentially materially adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition. Competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. Competition in the Software Change and Configuration Management Market. We face significant competition as we develop, market and sell our distributed systems products, including PVCS Professional, PVCS Version Manager and Dimensions CM products. Competitors in the distributed systems market include IBM, CA, Inc., Microsoft, and other smaller companies. A growing portion of the market is also using free open source tools to address their basic needs for issue/defect tracking and source code control, such as Jira and Subversion, resulting in an increased source of competition for our distributed system products, particularly PVCS Professional, PVCS Version Manager, Serena Business Manager and, to a lesser extent, Dimensions CM . Competition in the Mainframe market. We currently face competition from a number of sources, including:  customers internal IT departments;  providers of products that compete directly with ChangeMan ZMF and Comparex, such as CA, Inc., IBM and smaller privately-held companies; 15 Table of Contents  providers of application development programmer productivity and system management products, such as Compuware, IBM and smaller privately-held companies; and  providers of mainframe application availability products that compete directly with Serena Comparex and the Serena StarTool product family, such as Compuware, IBM, CA, Inc. and smaller privately-held companies. Competition in Other Markets. We currently face competition from a number of sources, including:  providers of on-premise application release automation solutions that compete with Serena Release Automation, such as BMC and smaller privately-held companies; and  providers of on-premise and SaaS-based ITSM solutions that compete with Serena Service Manager, such as BMC, ServiceNow and smaller privately-held companies. Future Competition. We may face competition in the future from established companies who have not previously entered the mainframe or distributed systems market or from emerging software companies and SaaS providers. Increased competition may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition due to price reductions, reduced gross margins and reduction in market share. Established companies may not only develop their own mainframe or distributed system products and SaaS-based solutions, but they may also acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our competitors, including cooperative relationships between large, established companies and smaller privately-held companies. Because larger companies have significant financial and organizational resources available, they may be able to quickly penetrate the mainframe or distributed systems market through acquisitions or strategic relationships and may be able to leverage the technology and expertise of smaller companies and develop successful ALM products and SaaS-based solutions. We expect that the software industry in general, and providers of ALM solutions in particular, will continue to consolidate. It is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Bundling or Compatibility Risks. Our ability to sell our products also depends, in part, on the compatibility of our products with other third party products, particularly those provided by IBM. Developers of these third party products may change their products so that they will no longer be compatible with our products. These third party developers may also decide to bundle their products with other ALM products for promotional purposes. If that were to happen, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected as we may be priced out of the market or no longer be able to offer commercially viable products. We may encounter problems conducting our international operations, and factors associated with international operations could adversely affect our business. International Operations. We have sales offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, France, Spain, Australia, Japan and Singapore. We have limited experience in marketing, selling and supporting our products in many countries, and may not be able to successfully market, sell, deliver and support our products internationally. Risks of International Operations. International sales were 35%, 36%, and 32%, of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our international revenue is attributable principally to our European operations. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, including the following:  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;  problems in collecting accounts receivable;  longer payment cycles;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and uncertainty about the future of currencies such as the Euro and the British Pound; 16 Table of Contents  inability to control or predict the levels of revenue produced by our international distributors;  seasonal reductions in business activity such as during the summer months in Europe and certain other parts of the world;  limitations on repatriation of earnings;  difficulties in enforcing the terms of our agreements with customers, distributors and resellers;  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;  increased austerity measures by several European governments;  political and economic instability;  recessionary environments in foreign economies; and  increases in tariffs, duties, price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries. We conduct substantial software development operations in the Ukraine that are subject to economic and political changes, changes in laws, policies and taxation and the current physical infrastructure of the country. Should we become unable to conduct operations in this country in the future, and our contingency and business continuity plans are unsuccessful in addressing the related risks to our software development operations, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, the laws of the Ukraine may not protect our intellectual property rights in our software products to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Furthermore, as the software and technology labor market in the Ukraine develops and multi-national companies compete for talent, there is a risk that wage and attrition rates may increase faster than we have anticipated, which could adversely affect our software development activities and results of operations. Growing market acceptance of open source software could cause a decline in our revenue and operating margins. Growing market acceptance of open source software has presented both benefits and challenges to the commercial software industry in recent years. Open Source software is made widely available by its authors and is licensed as is for a nominal fee or, in some cases, at no charge. As the use of open source software becomes more widespread, certain open source technology, such as Subversion, have become competitive with our products offering software version control capabilities, such as PVCS Version Manager and, to a lesser extent, Dimensions CM, which has caused the sale of these products to decline. In addition, Jira, an open source bug tracking tool, has become competitive with the use of Serena Business Manager as an issue and defect tracking tool. Further adoption of open source software within the markets that we sell could cause further declines in the sale of our products or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margins. We may experience delays in developing our products which could adversely affect our business. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new and improved products and services in a timely manner, this could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We have experienced product development delays in new version and update releases in the past and may experience similar or more significant product delays in the future. Difficulties in product development could delay or prevent the successful introduction or marketing of new or improved products or the delivery of new versions of our products to our customers. Any delay in releasing our new distributed systems products, for whatever reason, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 17 Table of Contents Acquisitions may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business or divert the attention of our management. Historically, we have expanded our product offerings by acquiring other companies and by acquiring specific products from third parties. We may acquire or make investments in other companies and technologies. In the event of any acquisitions or investments, we could:  incur debt;  assume liabilities;  incur charges for the impairment of the value of investments or acquired assets; or  incur amortization expense related to intangible assets. If we fail to achieve the financial and strategic benefits of past and future acquisitions or investments, our operating results will suffer. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous other risks, including:  difficulties integrating the acquired operations, technologies or products with ours;  failure to achieve targeted synergies;  unanticipated costs and liabilities;  diversion of managements attention from our core business;  adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers or those of the acquired organization;  difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and  potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired organizations. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses. A majority of our international business is conducted in foreign currencies, principally the Euro and the British pound. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses. We cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. We may experience currency losses in the future. To date, we have not adopted a hedging program to protect us from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Our goodwill became impaired in fiscal year 2009 and certain amortizable intangible assets became impaired in fiscal year 2010. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets again becomes impaired in the future, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in expected future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record significant charges in any future period for which impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined. Third parties in the future could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, possibly adversely affecting our business. Third parties may claim that our current or future products and services infringe their proprietary rights. Any claims of this type could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent future customers from licensing our products or using our services. Because we are dependent upon a limited number of products 18 Table of Contents and services, any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment or service deployment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. We expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products, services and competition in the software industry segments increase and the functionality of products and services in different industry segments overlap. In addition, we use open source software in our solutions and will use open source software in the future. From time to time we may face claims against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. Infringement claims could result in litigation, require us to purchase costly licenses or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. Errors in our products or the failure of our products to conform to specifications could result in our customers demanding refunds from us or asserting claims for damages against us. As our software products and services are complex, they often contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a products life cycle. While we continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services to identify and correct bugs in our software, we expect that errors in our products and services will continue to be found in the future. Although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial, certain of these errors could be significant. Detection of any significant errors may result in, among other things, loss of, or delay in, market acceptance and sales of our products and services, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, or increased service and warranty costs. These problems could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In the past we have discovered errors in certain of our products and have experienced delays in the shipment of our products during the period required to correct these errors. These delays have principally related to new version and product update releases. To date, none of these delays have materially affected our business. However, product and services errors or delays in the future, including any product and services errors or delays associated with the introduction of our distributed systems products and solutions, could be material. In addition, in certain cases we have warranted that our products will operate in accordance with specified customer requirements. If our products or services fail to conform to such specifications, customers could demand a refund for the software license fees or service fees paid to us or assert claims for damages. Product liability claims asserted against us in the future could adversely affect our business. We may be subject to claims for damages related to product errors in the future. A material product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business. Our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims. Our standard software licenses provide that if our products fail to perform, we will correct or replace such products. If these corrective measures fail, we may be required to refund the license fee for the non-performing products. Our standard license agreement limits our liability for non-performing products to the amount of license fee paid. Our standard license also provides that we will not be liable for indirect or consequential damages caused by the failure of our products. Such limitation of liability provisions may, however, not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions to the extent local laws treat certain warranty exclusions as unenforceable. Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products entail the risk of such claims. Changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies regarding revenue recognition could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue and profits. Although we use standardized license agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles, we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standardized agreements, particularly in multi-product or multi-year transactions. As our transactions increase in complexity with the sale of larger, multi-product, multi-year licenses, negotiation of mutually acceptable terms 19 Table of Contents and conditions can extend the sales cycle and, in certain situations, may require us to defer recognition of revenue on such licenses. We believe that we are in compliance with revenue recognition guidance applicable to software transactions, however, these future, more complex, multi-product, multi-year license transactions may require additional accounting analysis to account for them accurately, could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices and may contain terms affecting the timing of revenue recognition. If we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires an effective financial system and management process. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures and controls, could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand, manage our supply chain and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. Our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business, and such officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future. Our success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior executives and certain other key employees, including certain sales, consulting, technical and marketing personnel. If we lost the services of one or more of our executives or key employees, including if one or more of our executives or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, our business could be materially adversely affected. During fiscal year 2013, our Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President of North America Sales and Services, Vice President of Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer, and senior managers within our research and development organization and sales organization resigned from their positions at our company. Certain of our executive officers are not parties to employment agreements with us. In addition, we do not maintain key man life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so. If we are unable to successfully reorganize our business around the departures of executive officers or key personnel or identify, hire, train and integrate new executive officers or other key personnel into our business, if any new executive officers are unable to successfully perform in their positions, establish and implement our business strategy or manage our business, or if any key management personnel are unable to successfully perform in their positions or manage their functional areas, our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The interests of our controlling stockholder may differ from the interests of the holders of our securities. Investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 66.7% of our outstanding common stock as of January 31, 2013 and beneficially own the only authorized share of our series A preferred stock. In addition, Silver Lake and its affiliates, by virtue of their ownership of our common stock and their voting rights under a stockholders agreement, control the vote, in connection with substantially all matters subject to stockholder approval of more than 99% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this ownership and the terms of a stockholders agreement, Silver Lake is entitled to elect directors with majority voting power in our Board of Directors, to appoint new management and to approve actions requiring the approval of the holders of our outstanding voting shares as a single class, including adopting most amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. The interests of Silver Lake and its affiliates may differ from other holders of our securities in material respects. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of Silver Lake and its affiliates, as equity holders, might conflict with the interests of our other holders of our securities. Silver Lake and its affiliates may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to other holders of our securities, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Additionally, the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes permits us to pay advisory fees, dividends or 20 Table of Contents make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and Silver Lake may have an interest in our doing so. We are party to a management advisory agreement with Silver Lake that provides for us to pay advisory and other fees to Silver Lake. Silver Lake and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time in the future, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. You should consider that the interests of Silver Lake and its affiliates may differ from other holders of our securities in material respects. We rely on certain licenses from third parties and the loss or inability to obtain or renew any such licenses could harm our business. Several of our products are designed to include intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary for us to seek or renew such licenses in the future. While we believe such licenses generally can be obtained or renewed on commercially reasonable terms, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses will be available or renewed on acceptable terms. The inability to obtain or renew certain licenses or other rights on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results, including the ability to continue to support our affected products. Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or tax returns from tax authorities could adversely affect our results. Our future effective tax rates could fluctuate or be adversely affected by events such as but not limited to: having higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have high statutory tax rates and having lower than anticipated earnings in countries where we have low statutory tax rates; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; expiration of, or lapses in, research and development tax credit regulations applicable to us; transfer pricing adjustments under our intercompany cost sharing arrangements and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations. We are also subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and international tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Business interruptions could adversely affect our business. Our operations and the operations of our business partners and customers are vulnerable to interruptions by earthquake, fire, hurricane, nuclear reactor leak, power loss, tsunami and other events beyond our control. For example, our corporate headquarters is located near major earthquake faults. We do not have multiple capacity sites to support all of our services in the event of such an occurrence. Additionally, major public health issues such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic may interrupt our business operations or our customers in the geographic regions affected by the particular health issue. In the event that a material business interruption occurs that affects us or our customers, we may be unable to deliver our software products or provide maintenance and professional services to customers as promised, and our business and financial results could be harmed. Furthermore, our IT infrastructure including our network and servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, malware attacks, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering of our IT systems and infrastructure. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and result in potential claims from third parties of liability and damages. ITEM 1B.
