D. Risk Factors. The gold price declined after 1997 and until 2002, reportedly for reasons including declining inflation in many countries worldwide. In 2003 the gold price rose above $400 (London P.M. Fix) per ounce, reaching $416 at the end of 2003 and by December 2004 had reached $454 before settling at $438 by the end of 2004. In early 2005 the gold price declined to levels below $415 before once again resuming its steady uptrend to reach $537 in December 2005 before settling at $517 at the end of December 2005. The volatility in the market continued through 2006 due to movements in the exchange rate, oil prices as well as ongoing tensions in the Middle East, economic and political uncertainty and shocks in the equity markets. Supply and demand balances play an important role in the gold price. On the supply side we had falling production from a few large mines while on the demand side we have increasing consumption in China and India and greater investor demand. The first and second quarters of 2006 saw major producer de-hedging. In 2006, the gold price was volatile trading between $525 per ounce in January 2006 to a high of $725 in May before closing at $634 at the end of December 2006. In the first three months of 2006 gold traded around an average of $550 per ounce. By the middle of April gold was able to break over $600 and continued on a bull run until the middle of May. After reaching $725 there was a rapid pull back to $567 by the middle of June. The price then recovered to $600 by the end of June and by the middle of July was at $672. The market then tended to settle into a range for the next few months trading between $610 and $650. The market broke down in September with the price falling to $576 by September 20. Gold continued to trade between this price and $600, until it was able to break over $600 at the start of November. For the next three months gold traded in a range of $600 to $648. In the first quarter of 2007, gold was again able to move up significantly reaching a high of $686 on February 26, 2007 but a shock to the world equity markets in March saw gold fall back sharply to $637 on March 5, 2007. As inflation issues resurfaced and weakness in the dollar returned, gold traded back to $662 at the end of March. Hedging  Historically, the Company has sought to mitigate gold price risk, in part, through hedging strategies. The policy of the Company has been to seek where appropriate to protect operating, sustaining capital and debt servicing costs through hedging activities. This has included periodic purchase of put options, spot deferred sales, and forward sales covering a portion of future gold production at a fixed price. The Company regularly evaluates the portion of its production that is hedged. The Company does not engage in speculative activity and does not trade its hedged positions. - 42 - Table of Contents The average realized price after excluding fair value gains and losses in 2006 represents a discount of 20% to the average spot price for the year (2005: discount of 13%; 2004 discount of 10%). This discount effectively reduced pre-tax profit by $59.6 million for the year (2005: decrease of $34 million; 2004: decrease of $24 million). Following the adoption of IAS39 in 2001, gains and losses arising from the early closure of hedge transactions prior to 2001 were transferred to equity, to be recycled into income when the underlying transactions, against which the hedges were initially designated, took place. The net amount of gains/losses, arising from the early closure and re-designation of hedge transactions, retained in equity at December 31, 2006 was a gain of $6.6 million (2005: gain of $8.7 million; 2004: gain of $14.4 million), following the recycling of losses totaling $17.1 million (2005: losses of $13.5 million, 2004: losses of $17.2 million). Based on a hedge book valuation of minus $332.8 million as at December 31, 2006, a further $363.4 million of losses remain in equity to be recycled into income when the underlying transactions, against which the hedges that are designated, take place. The profile of hedging gains/(losses), as at December 31, 2006, are detailed in the schedule below: Residual Other Deferred hedging Comprehensive Total OCI recycled to Costs / (Gains) Income income Year $ millions $ millions $ millions 2007 (2.2 ) 90.2 88.0 2008 (2.8 ) 74.1 71.3 2009 (1.5 ) 85.5 84.0 2010 (0.1 ) 66.1 66.0 2011  36.7 36.7 2012  5.2 5.2 2013  5.6 5.6 Total (6.6 ) 363.4 356.8 Lihir did not enter into any new hedge contracts in 2006. Lihir delivered into hedge contracts in accordance with its delivery schedule for 2006 of 206,500 ounces. The delivery pursuant to these hedge contracts was in accordance with the Companys objective to provide shareholders greater exposure to spot price movements and to reduce the total hedge book exposure. As part of the hedge book restructure in September 2005, the Company negotiated the smoothing of the profile of future gold deliveries. This was achieved by investing $62 million in canceling substantial out of the money hedges, extending maturity dates and increasing strike prices for a major portion of the book. Following the completion of the restructure, the hedge book was reduced from 1.7 million ounces to 1.2 million ounces plus the gold loan of 480,000 ounces. This will provide the Company with greater exposure to the spot price of gold. The revised hedge book profile is reflected in the tabulation at Note 24 to the financial statements. The maximum level of hedging stipulated in the new Syndicated Facility Agreement is 10% of proven and probable reserves. See Item 11  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk and Note 24 to the Financial Statements for more details. The negative valuation of the companys hedge book represents a significant opportunity loss to the current spot price of gold. The Company has not written any new hedges since September 2005 and is continually reviewing its hedging policy in light of current market conditions, obligations and market sentiment. In establishing the forward price of hedging contracts, the Company has, on certain occasions, elected to retain an exposure to gold lease rates. This strategy had added value to the hedge book in the years immediately prior to 2005 years by not only providing for higher forward prices, but also creating value on the lease rate swaps as the lease rate curve has fallen to historically low levels. The revaluation of these lease rate positions flow directly to the P&L. In 2003 and 2004 lease rates fell significantly resulting in significant profits from these positions. In 2005, the Company had a modest increase in the lease rates resulting in a small loss. In 2006, the lease rate curve remained at very low levels and the total movement in market value of the lease rate swaps, as independently valued was a loss of $1.3 million (2005: loss of $0.4 million; 2004: gain of $13.2 million; 2003: gain of $14.7 million). The Company has recognized this movement in market value in the income statement on the basis that it does not satisfy the criteria for hedge accounting under the relevant international accounting standards (IAS 39 or FAS 133). Lihir has a number of offsetting positions which will reduce its exposure to movements in Lease Rates. Notwithstanding the Companys active management of this lease rate exposure, further increases in this curve could have a negative impact on the mark to market of lease rate swaps and therefore adversely affect the Companys earnings. - 43 - Table of Contents Production and Operating Costs  The following table shows gold production, average annual cash production and cash operating costs from 2004 to 2006. 2006 2005 2004 Ore Processed (Tonnes 000s) 4,344 3,482 4,091 Gold Produced (Ounces) 650,811 595,966 599,386 Grade (g Au/t) 5.14 5.98 5.11 Operating Expenses ($000s) Mining expenses 107,551 95,304 89,687 Exploration expenses 5,976 6,198 5,306 Processing costs 47,875 41,654 41,524 Power generation costs 27,000 27,413 29,237 General and administrative costs 66,618 57,884 53,102 Refining, royalty and management fees 12,972 6,813 7,144 Deferred mining costs (56,349 ) (25,048 ) (37,865 ) Costs deferred and transferred to inventories (19,395 ) (39,208 ) (3,557 ) 192,248 171,010 184,578 Production Costs ($ per tonne of ore processed) Mining 24.8 27.4 21.9 Exploration 1.4 1.8 1.3 Processing 11.0 12.0 10.2 Power generation 6.2 7.9 7.1 General and Administrative 15.2 16.6 13.0 Total 58.6 65.7 53.5 The 2006 plan for gold production was 670,400 ounces from the processing of 4.3 million tonnes of ore at 5.5 g/t Au feed grade. A total of 650,811 ounces was produced from processing 4.34 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 5.14 g/t. The main contributing factors to the lower than planned gold production in 2006 were:  Lower than expected mill feed grade; and  Total plant gold recovery was 90.2% in 2006, which was marginally below the plan of 90.6% recovery being adversely impacted by the higher than plan autoclave throughput which marginally reduced the % oxidation of sulphides. These factors were partially offset by the fact that:  Autoclave operating time averaged 90.6% in 2006, which was ahead of the planned 89.2%; and,  Autoclave throughput for 2006 was 184.5 tonnes per operating hour per autoclave which was ahead of the planned 180 tph/ac. Commissioning of the gravity circuit continued throughout 2006. The circuit as constructed contained a number of design issues, which are being resolved. It was established, however, that there was negligible amounts of gravity recoverable gold present in the current ore feed. The circuit will be operated periodically in 2007 to monitor the amount of gravity recoverable present and if justified the circuit will be re-commissioned. The 30 megawatt Geothermal Power Station was commissioned by July 2005 and its reliability has increased significantly following several minor modifications and repairs to damage to turbines caused during commissioning. 2006 ex-pit production of 56,150 million tonnes was 2.29 million tonnes above budget. Phase 7 development was 2.4 million tonnes ahead of budget despite geothermal issues encountered in April and resulting restrictions to mining. Phase 6 was 3.8 million tonnes ahead of schedule for the year, while Phase 8 was 4.4 million tonnes behind as a result of targeting Phase 6 and 7 to aggressively pursue high grade ore to support gold production for 2006. Key factors in surpassing the budgeted material movement for 2006 were:  Increase in supervisory manning levels to raise the utilization rates;  Improved equipment availabilities; - 44 - Table of Contents  Quick reaction to geothermal issues with corresponding controls; and  Mining on inclined benches in all areas to produce better floors. Major operational issues encountered through 2006:  Geothermal event in April in Phase 7 delayed production from this area. This arose when an eruption of steam and rock occurred from an undetected zone of pressure beneath an area being mined. Procedures have now been modified to prevent a recurrence of this event; and  Ground water levels in Phase 5 locked out high grade ore during the fourth quarter. Production of 650,811 ounces of gold in bullion was achieved with higher mill throughput. Gold recovery increased to 90.2% on average for the year. Mining Expenses  Mining expenses were $108 million in 2006 (2005: $95 million; 2004: $90 million). Costs for 2006 were higher than 2005 as a result of increasing cost of mining inputs such as fuel, tires, explosives and maintenance. Costs for 2005 were higher than 2004 as a result of increased maintenance and a larger mining fleet, and higher fuel prices. The major elements of total mining costs during the open pit mining phase are hauling, loading, blasting and dewatering. These elements combined account for an average of approximately 60% of total direct mining costs throughout the reporting periods. Mining expenses were allocated between the direct process ore and stockpile ore on the basis of the amount of contained gold with only the costs attributable to direct process ore expensed. Mining costs attributable to the stockpiled ore will be expensed when the ore is processed and sold during the stockpile processing period after open pit mining ceases. In accordance with international accounting standard IAS 2, inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. As at December 31, 2006, the Company believes the processing of these stockpiles will have a future economic benefit to the Company and accordingly values these stockpiles at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is assessed annually based on the product expected to be obtained from the ore at the estimated selling price less costs as calculated for other inventories of ore and metal, less all further costs to completion and all anticipated costs to be incurred prior to its sale. In the years prior to 2004, a full provision of $65 million was made against non-current stockpiles on the basis that cost exceeded net realizable value. In accordance with IAS 2, at December 31, 2004, that previous write-down was fully reversed to reflect the cost of these stockpiles, which is the amount expected to be realized from future processing of that ore. Direct expenditure on mining such as stripping, drilling and depreciation costs, are brought to account on a pit basis for each stage of the mines development based on the estimated ratio of waste to ore for each pit. The actual ratio of waste to ore removed for each pit varies from year to year. In periods where more than the average amount of waste is removed the surplus is transferred to deferred mining costs. It is subsequently expensed during periods where the waste to ore ratio is less than the average. The average amount of waste to be removed is assessed according to the on a pit-by-pit basis, and not over the entire life of the mine. The increase in deferred mining costs during 2006 reflected the actual mining sequence undertaken during the year. Processing Costs - Processing costs were $48 million in 2006, (2005: $42 million; 2004: $42 million) with significantly increased throughput in 2006 (+25%) being the main driver for the increase in costs over 2005. Unit costs decreased by 12% in 2006 compared to 2005. Power Generation Costs  Despite significantly higher costs for heavy fuel oil, the commissioning of the 30MW geothermal power station in July 2005 has seen power generation costs remain consistent at $27 million in 2006 (2005: $27 million; 2004: $29 million). General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative costs were $67 million in 2006 (2005: $58 million; 2004: $53 million). Staff costs increased in 2006 following a concerted recruitment drive to fill a significant number of vacancies for both new and existing positions. The continued focus by the Company on the community saw an increase in assistance programs such as health and housing along with costs associated with its environmental programs. Additional costs were also incurred in accommodating the Companys workforce. These items contributed to an overall increase in general and administrative expenses of $9 million in 2006 compared to 2005. In comparing 2005 to 2004, offsetting a positive impact from exchange rate movements in 2005 of $1.3 million were one-off costs of associated with the hedge book restructure ($3.6 million), and losses on disposal of assets being geothermal wells now no longer in use ($2.2 million) and water pipeline destroyed by the landslide ($0.5 million). Increased staff costs were realized with the gradual move towards the Company becoming fully independent from Rio Tinto. With a greater focus on the community, Lihirs donations, community assistance programs, and housing assistance increased, as did its cost associated with its environmental management programs. These items contributed to an overall increase in general and administrative expenses of $5.0 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Royalty, Refining and Management Fees - These totaled $13 million in 2006 (2005: $6.8 million; 2004: $7.1 million). Mining royalties payable to the PNG Government are 2% of the FOB value of the gold produced. With Lihirs move to fully independent management in early October 2005 from Rio Tinto, the Companys payment of a management fee to Lihir Management Company Pty Limited ceased. Since the separation from Rio Tinto, the Lihir mine now pays a management fee to LSA, a subsidiary of the Company. See Item 10. Additional Information  C. Material Contracts  Lihir Management for a description of the management agreement between Lihir and LSA. - 45 - Table of Contents In 2006, the Company paid $5.6 million to LSA. Gold refining is carried out by AGR Matthey, a partnership between the Western Australian Mint, Australian Gold Alliance Pty Ltd and Johnson Matthey (Aust.) Ltd, under a refining agreement, expiring on February 28, 2008. The refining fee is comprised of a refining charge, transport and insurance charges and a location London swap charge. On February 21, 2007, the PNG Government gazetted a new production levy in respect of minerals and alluvial gold (production levy). The production levy in relation to minerals is 0.25% of the assessable income, as defined in the Income Tax Act 1959, of the mineral producer. The production levy is payable to the Mineral Resources Authority. The introduction of the Production Levy was supported by the mining industry in PNG, with the proceeds to be used to support the operation of the Mineral Resources Authority established by the PNG National Government. Unit Costs  These are shown in the table below prepared in accordance with the Gold Institute Standard. The following table presents Lihirs results in a format that includes certain un-audited non-GAAP measures, such as cash costs. The table is also presented to show separately non-cash costs, other operating costs not included in the determination of gross cash costs and impairment adjustments. The measures used and the presentation are intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity and performance of Lihirs mining operations. In particular, cash costs is a measure that is used in the gold mining industry and was developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability. However, Lihirs measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses this measure for the same purpose when monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Company. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. $/ounce 2006 2005 2004 Gross operating costs 403 378 356 - Exploration (9 ) (10 ) (9 ) - Other corporate costs (8 ) (4 )  Direct mining expenses * 385 364 347 - Deferred mining costs (76 ) (37 ) (53 ) - Refining costs * 1 1 1 - Inventory adjustment (24 ) (54 ) (33 ) Cash operating costs 287 274 262 - Royalties * 10 8 8 Total cash costs 297 282 270 - Depreciation 57 60 55 - Restoration and mine closure    - Non-cash deferred mining costs (10 ) (5 ) (10 ) - Non-cash inventory adjustment 1 (1 ) (2 ) - Economic Grade Stockpile Adjustment  Non Cash (3 ) (5 ) (12 ) Total production costs 342 331 301 * Components of Gross Cash Costs Total cash costs per ounce were $297 in 2006 which was $15 per ounce or five percent higher than in 2005. The increase was primarily due to the increasing cost of mining inputs such as fuel, tyres, explosives and maintenance. Other Charges Depreciation and Amortization  The depreciation charge for 2006 amounted to $37.4 million (2005: $35.8 million; 2004: $32.9 million). Depreciation was higher in 2006 and 2005 due to an increase in tonnes mined, tonnes milled and gold produced. Capitalized development costs for mine properties are amortized using the units-of-production method. The units-of-production method results in an amortization charge proportional to the depletion of estimated proven and probable ore reserves. The cost of buildings, machinery and equipment is written off over the expected economic life of the item, adopting a method that reflects the consumption of economic benefits. This may be based on the units-of-production method or a fixed percentage over time. The vast majority of the Companys assets are depreciated on a units-of-production basis. - 46 - Table of Contents Interest Expense  Net finance costs amounted to $4.8 million in 2006 (2005: costs of $2.4 million; 2004: benefits of $1.4 million). The net cost results primarily from a lower cash balance maintained throughout 2006 and increased borrowings. The two major capital construction projects being undertaken during the year caused cash balances to be lower. Additionally, an increase in interest expense is reflected in 2006 and 2005 following the drawdown of the gold loan and $30 million of the revolving credit facility (See Item 10. Additional Information  C. Material Contracts  Financing Agreements) in September 2005. During October 2006 an A$45 million drawdown was made on the Ballarat Goldfields Bilateral Facility (See Item 10. Additional Information  C. Material Contracts  Financing Agreements) to fund the 11% investment in shares in Ballarat undertaken at that time. Tax Expense  Since 2001, the Company has been subject to a 30% tax in respect of income derived from the Lihir mine. This is the general rate of taxation for resident PNG corporations. In the case of a resource project, like Lihir, mining income derived from the resource project is assessed as if it were the only income of the owner of the resource project holder of the lease and deductions are generally only available for expenditures attributable to the resource project to which the lease relates. The Company has been given approval to prepare its tax returns in US dollars. Income derived in the Australian operations is subject to a 30% tax. Up to and including the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company was eligible to accelerate its tax depreciation and amortisation. These accelerated depreciation and amortization deductions eliminated the Companys taxable income during the early years of gold production from the Lihir mine. For the years ended December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2004, the Company was eligible to claim tax depreciation and amortisation and to the extent these exceeded the Companys income less other deductions the Company incurred a tax loss. This tax loss can be carried forward and claimed as a deduction in future years. From January 1, 2005, the deduction available for depreciation and amortisation will be limited to an amount which brings the Companys taxable income to nil. The amount not claimed is added back to the unclaimed balance and is available for amortisation in future years. Tax effect accounting procedures are followed using the liability method for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Income tax on temporary differences is set aside to deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset accounts at current rates of tax. Deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differences and tax losses are only carried forward as an asset to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. At the end of 2004 Lihir recognized $85 million of net deferred tax assets on the grounds that, based on long-term forecasts for the gold price, the realization of future profits to be regarded as probable. In 2005 a further $3 million net deferred asset was recognized with a decrease of $1.5 million recorded in 2006. A 4% mining levy imposed in the 1998 PNG Government budget was amended during 1999 following considerable lobbying by industry groups. The mining levy was replaced by a more revenue neutral structure, designed to ensure that the government did not lose revenue as a result of the introduction of a Value Added Tax (VAT) system in 1999, subsequently renamed as a goods and services tax (GST) in 2004. Essentially the mining levy seeks to impose an additional charge on purchases by the Company to compensate for the revenue forgone by the Government on reducing various import duties on the introduction of the GST system. The terms of this arrangement were negotiated between the government and industry groups. In the 2001 annual budget the PNG Government announced that the mining levy would be phased out over 4 years from January 1 2002. This decision was repealed in the 2003 budget and the levy was left at 75% of the original rate introduced. However, after lobbying by industry groups a decision was made by the PNG Government to re-introduce the phase out of the mining levy from 2004. The levy is now to be phased out more gradually over a five year period with 5% removed in 2004, 10% removed in 2005, 15% in 2006, 20% in 2007 and the remaining 25% in 2008. Since 2001, the dividend withholding tax has been 10%. At December 31, 2006, the Company had a net deferred tax position of $86.2 million (2005: $87.7 million and 2004: $84.8 million), a current period tax expense of $22.1 million (2005: tax expense of $5.9 million, 2004: tax benefit of $14.7 million) included in the income statement and a tax benefit of $99.8 million (2005: $79 million, 2004: $70.1 million) included in equity. At that date the Company also had unrecognized capital tax losses of $219.5 million (2005: $218.7 million, 2004: $219.8 million) and net deductible temporary differences of $67.9 million (2005: $73.8 million and 2004: $62.9 million). Where the tax losses relate to Papua New Guinea they can be carried forward for a period not exceeding 20 years. The tax losses arising in the Australian jurisdiction can be carried forward indefinitely. In 2006, 2005 and 2004 deferred tax assets have been recognized beyond deferred tax liabilities because the Company considers the realization of the tax benefits through future taxable profits as probable (implying a high level of likelihood). The recognition of deferred tax assets to the extent of deferred tax liabilities is required under IAS 12, as they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the taxable temporary differences are expected to reverse in the same period as the deductible temporary differences. Impairment Provisions Impairment testing of asset values In 1999 following continued weakness in prevailing prices and the outlook for the gold market prompted a downward revision in Lihirs long-term gold price assumption as at December 31, 1999 from $350/oz to $325/oz. Lihir restated its 1999 financial accounts to record a $237 million impairment provision in compliance with International Accounting Standard IAS 36. - 47 - Table of Contents Lihir responded to the deteriorating outlook for gold by further reducing its long-term gold price assumption from $325 to $300/oz as at December 31, 2000. The resulting impairment provision was $121 million, which was reflected in Lihirs 2000 accounts. Together with the $237 million provision taken in its re-stated 1999 accounts, Lihir has made a cumulative non-cash impairment charge of $358 million. In 2004, having applied the same principles as prior years and revisiting critical assumptions, including life of mine and remaining reserves, an impairment reversal of $205.7 million (2003: $31.1 million) was credited to the income statement in accordance with IAS36, based on a long-term gold price assumption of $380 (2003: $US340) and a pre-tax real discount rate of 7% (2003: 7%). At December 31, 2004 the asset impairment charges of 1999 and 2000 were fully reversed to the extent allowed under IAS36. In 2006, having applied the same principles as prior years and revisiting critical assumptions, no impairment reversal nor impairment loss was required to be recognized in accordance with IAS36, based on a long-term gold price assumption of $500 and a pre-tax real discount rate of 7%. Impairment testing of economic grade stockpiles Also as a result of the increase in the long-term gold price assumption to $500 per ounce the Company includes the economic benefits of processing the economic grade stockpiles within the Companys net realizable value calculation. In 2004, prior years provisions totaling $65 million were fully reversed and together with the 2004 cost of stockpile additions of $25 million, the stockpile was valued at $90 million. At December 31, 2006 the amount that is expected to be realized from future processing of the ore exceeds the cost of $142 million. Foreign Currency Fluctuations The Companys functional currency is the US dollar and accordingly its Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in that currency. Virtually all of the Companys revenues and a significant portion of its operating expenses are denominated in US dollars. A large portion of the Companys total expenditure, principally relating to expatriate salaries and benefits, consultants, grinding materials, and explosives are denominated in Australian dollars and certain of its expenses, including labour and consumables, are denominated in Kina. Accordingly, a depreciation of the US dollar against the Australian dollar or Kina adversely affects the Companys financial results. In addition, the Company is subject to certain PNG requirements regarding the maintenance of cash reserves in PNG in a Kina-denominated account. See Item 10. Additional Information  D. Exchange Controls. Recently Issued US Financial Accounting Standards In June 2004, a committee of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) began discussing the accounting treatment for the stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine under US GAAP. In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified EITF Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry. EITF No. 04-6 addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable production costs that should be included as a component of inventory to be recognized in costs applicable to sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory. As a result, capitalization of post-production stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. The guidance in EITF No. 04-6 is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to adopt EITF No. 04-6 effective January 1, 2006. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs  an amendment of ARB No. 43. SFAS 151 adopts the IASB view related to inventories that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. SFAS 151 was effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 and was to be applied prospectively. Adoption of SFAS 151 did not have an impact on the Companys financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised) Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board opinion No. 25. Under US GAAP, the Company has applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R since January 1, 2006. As a result, the provisions of SFAS 123R have been applied to all awards granted after July 1, 1995. There are no additional adjustments required in the current period as a result of this application. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154), which deals with all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by an accounting pronouncement if that pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 replaces APB Opinion 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. This Statement requires retrospective application of a change in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects of the cumulative effect of the change, in which case the change in principle is applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable. Corrections of an error require adjusting previously issued financial statements. SFAS 154 was effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. This standard is consistent with the entitys accounting policy under IFRS and there was no impact of adopting this standard. - 48 - Table of Contents In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our US GAAP consolidated results of operations and financial condition and have not yet reached final conclusions. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Tax Force in Issue No. 06-3 (EITF 06-03), How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That is, Gross versus Net Presentation). The scope of EITF 06-03 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing activity between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. EITF 06-03 also concluded that the presentation of taxes within its scope on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or net (excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy decision subject to appropriate disclosure. EITF 06-03 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company currently presents these taxes on a net basis. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We have not yet determined the impact SFAS 157 will have on our US GAAP consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In September of 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effect of Prior Year Misstatements when Qualifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 is effective for companies with fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides an alternative measurement treatment for certain financial assets and financial liabilities, under an instrument-by-instrument election, that permits fair value to be used for both initial and subsequent measurement, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. While SFAS 159 is effective beginning January 1, 2008, earlier adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2007, provided that the entity also adopts all of the requirements of SFAS 157. We are currently evaluating whether we will adopt SFAS 159 early, and the impact SFAS 159 may have on our consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued IFRS Standards Certain new accounting standards and IFRIC interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the December 31 2006 reporting period. The group is currently considering the impact of the following new and revised standards: (i) in August 2005, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. IFRS 7 revises and enhances IAS 30 Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institutions and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Presentation. IFRS 7 is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2007. The group has not elected to early adopt IFRS 7. (ii) in November 2006, the IASB issued IFRS 8 Operating Segments. IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 131. IFRS 8 is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009. The group has elected not to early adopt IFRS 8. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company continues to receive positive cash flows from operations. See Item 3. Key Information  A. Selected Financial Data. During 2005, Lihir completed the expenditure of the proceeds from the capital raised in 2003 to finance further capital expenditure, including the construction of geothermal power stations to replace the existing heavy fuel oil station. Construction of an additional 20-megawatts of geothermal energy capacity commenced in late 2005 and is expected to be complete in the early part of 2007. Work is continuing to define the total productive steam reserve available. Lihir is conducting a feasibility study into the expansion of the processing plant to lift production to about 1 million ounces per annum which would require significant funds to move into a development phase. In conjunction with the feasibility study the Company is considering various funding options to meet Lihirs short to medium term requirements. Gold Loan and Project Financing Facility Lihir is a borrower under a syndicated facility agreement dated September 13, 2005 (Syndicated Facility Agreement), arranged by ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (Australia Branch). The initial financiers of the facility were: ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (Australia Branch), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, BNP - 49 - Table of Contents Paribas Singapore Branch, Bank of Western Australia Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Macquarie Bank Limited, National Australia Bank Limited, Natexis Banques Populaires Hong Kong Branch, Société Générale, WestLB AG Sydney Branch, and Westpac Banking Corporation. ABN AMRO Australia Limited acts as facility agent and security trustee in relation to the Syndicated Facility Agreement. The Syndicated Facility Agreement consists of two facilities. The first facility is a $50 million revolving credit facility. The interest applicable to the revolving credit facility, inclusive of political risk insurance, is 1.90% over LIBOR plus a PRI premium of 0.95%. $30 million of this facility was drawn on October 26, 2006. The second facility is a 480,000 ounce gold facility fully drawn down on September 15, 2005, generating funds of $215.6 million at the draw down price of $449.00 per ounce. Mandatory prepayments are required under the Syndicated Facility Agreement under certain conditions. The Company has pledged its assets, gold production and cash balances as collateral and has provided a range of covenants and warranties in relation to the facility. The Syndicated Facility Agreement permits the payment of dividends and other distributions only if certain conditions are met. The Company may generally at any time prior to the next calculation date (June 30 and December 31 each year with the first Calculation Date being December 31, 2007, as defined in the agreement) withdraw all or part of any excess over a specified minimum cash balance in an offshore account for its own purposes (including any distribution or payment into an unsecured distribution account) subject to conditions specified within the Syndicated Facility Agreement. See also Item, 10  Additional Information  C. Material Contracts  Financing Agreements for a more detailed description of the terms of the Syndicated Facility Agreement. Ballarat Goldfields Facility Lihirs subsidiary, LAH, is party to a 364 day Ballarat Goldfields bilateral facility agreement dated October 17, 2006, with a bank. The facility is a cash advance facility consisting of two tranches, both of which are repayable on the date falling 364 days from the date of the Bilateral Facility Agreement. Tranche A consists of an A$45 million cash advance facility which was drawn in full in connection with the merger between Lihir and Ballarat. Tranche B consists of an A$5 million cash advance facility which is permitted to be drawn down for the purpose of financing capital requirements of the Ballarat East Gold Project being undertaken by Ballarat. $2 million was drawn down under Tranche B on February 26, 2007. Interest on the facility is paid at the rate shown on the Reuters screen BBSY on the first day of each interest period plus a margin of 1.75%. Mandatory prepayment of the facility is required under certain conditions. LAH has pledged its assets in favour of the bank and provided a range of covenants and warranties in relation to the facility. Lihir has pledged 50% of the balance of the distribution account at any time in favour of the bank as security for the borrowings under the Bilateral Facility Agreement. See also Item, 10  Additional Information  C. Material Contracts  Financing Agreements for a more detailed description of the Bilateral Facility Agreement. Net Debt/Cash Position The Companys net debt/cash position as at December 31 for each of the past three years is as follows: Net debt as at December 31 $ 000 2006 2005 2004 Syndicated Facility Agreement  revolving credit facility (30,000 )  (19,509 ) Syndicated Facility Agreement  gold loan (215,520 ) (215,520 )  Ballarat Goldfields bilateral facility agreement (35,595 )   Less cash on hand 47,032 127,836 83,559 Net (debt)/cash1 (234,083 ) (87,684 ) 64,050 Equity (811,877 ) (783,472 ) (837,223 ) Net debt to debt plus equity1 22.4 % 10.0 % N/A 1 Does not include cash from the Ballarat Goldfields bilateral facility agreement that was paid to Ballarat prior to the Ballarat merger. While Lihir currently believes that it has or will have access to resources sufficient to finance its operations, the adequacy of the Companys financial resources will depend upon its ability to generate sufficient revenues from gold production, to have continued access to equity capital market funding, and to keep its costs and other expenditures within its current estimates. Lihir believes that working capital is sufficient for its present requirements. At December 31, 2006 Lihirs capital expenditure commitments totaled $68.3 million (2005: $86.3 million; 2004 $34.7 million). The Companys capital expenditure requirements for 2007 are expected to be approximately $129 million for the - 50 - Table of Contents Lihir mine, including the committed amount of $68.3 million, plus an additional A$80 million in estimated 2007 and 2008 capital expenditure related to Ballarat. This committed expenditure relates to the flotation plant ($43.7 million), 20MW geothermal power station ($5.4 million), blast hole drill rigs ($5.1 million), oxygen plant motor ($2.4 million) and dewatering equipment ($1.2 million) and other smaller projects. The Company does not currently have a formal credit rating and is not aware of any information issued by ratings agencies that would influence the Companys ability to raise funds as, and when, required. Net Cash Flow From Operating Activities Cash generated from operating activities in 2006 was $58.7 million, an increase of $49.1 million over 2005. This was driven by the higher realized gold price (up $91 per ounce). Cash payments increased by $5.1 million, consistent with the increase in gross operating costs. Cash generated from operating activities in 2005 was $9.5 million, a reduction of $20.8 million over 2004. This was driven by the landslide which occurred in October 2005 resulting in the loss of production for a period of approximately one month. Despite the loss of one months gold production, a higher realized gold price (up $13 per ounce) offset the cost of lost production. Cash payments increased by $16.2 million, consistent with the increase in gross operating costs. Cash Flow From Financing Activities In 2006, debt outstanding increased to $281.1 million following draws from the revolving credit facility in the amount of $30.0 million and from the Ballarat Goldfields bilateral facility of $35.6 million in anticipation of the Ballarat Goldfields NL acquisition. In the first half of 2005, debt outstanding increased to $49.5 million following a drawdown in May 2005 from the Syndicated Facility Agreement of $30.0 million. In September 2005, the Company established a new Syndicated Facility Agreement and drew down 480,000 ounces of gold which it sold at the then spot gold price of $449 per ounce, thereby raising $215.5 million. The establishment of the new facility enabled the Company to restructure its hedge book and repay its debt obligations consisting of the $30.0 million May 2005 drawdown and its existing 2004 debt balance of $19.5 million. A further $62.2 million was utilized to cancel certain substantial out-of-the-money hedges, to extend maturity dates and to increase strike prices for a major portion of its hedge book. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc Lihir does not have a significant research and development program. D. Trend Information Lihir officially commenced production in October 1997 and had produced a total of over 5.6 million ounces of gold by December 31, 2006. There has been an ongoing program to increase both the reliability of the plant and its throughput capacity. This has seen milled throughput steadily rise from 2.35 million tonnes in 1998 to a project to date record of 4.34 million tonnes in 2006. Commissioning of the new flotation expansion and further incremental improvement projects are expected to see plant throughput increase to over 5.3 million tonnes in 2007. The new flotation circuit will produce a higher-grade gold concentrate, providing a second, enhanced source of ore gold feed to the existing autoclaves. The flotation plant is expected to derive increased production of around 140,000 ounces of gold per annum on average over its first seven years of operation, at significantly lower marginal cost. From 2007 through 2010, it is estimated that the annual gold production capacity of the Lihir mine and processing facilities will be over 800,000 ounces. In January 2007, the Lihir Gold Limited Board approved expenditure of a feasibility study aimed at increasing process plant capacity in order for it to consistently produce in excess of 1 million ounces of gold annually. This feasibility study is due to be completed early in 2008. Gold production depends on both plant performance and grade. During the 2003 and 2004 years, the grade of feed to the mill reduced from prior years as mining moved from the Minifie deposit and stripping was undertaken from the Lienetz pit. Grades improved in the second half of 2005 as mining moved into the higher grade benches of the Lienetz deposit. In 2006 mining progressed almost entirely from the Lienitz area with grades generally lower than 2005 in line with the mining strategy of extracting higher grade ore preferentially. In April 2003, the Company commissioned 6 megawatts electrical generating capacity utilizing geothermal steam as its energy source. A further 30 megawatts electrical generating capacity using geothermal was commissioned in June of 2005. Construction of a further 20 megawatts of geothermal electrical generating capacity is due to be completed in early 2007 which is expected to meet anticipated power generation needs following expansion of the processing plant. This form of energy generation provides both significant cost and environmental benefits. Efforts to find additional suitable geothermal steam sources to further reduce heavy fuel consumption in the generation of power and to meet the power requirements of further expanded process plant are continuing. In 2004 and 2005, demand for commodities, particularly from emerging economies such as China and India, has significantly heightened worldwide mining activity, thereby placing supply constraints on some materials and spare parts consumed in the operation. The Company accordingly experienced significant increases in such costs. Attention is being - 51 - Table of Contents given to reducing costs in all areas of the business, particularly through use of geothermal power in the face of rising fuel costs. However, increased production is expected to have a more significant effect in lowering unit costs. Lihir Gold has undertaken an ongoing exploration program, mainly in the Luise Caldera, aimed at defining resource and reserve levels. This has resulted in increases in both resource and reserves to the levels as disclosed in the Reserves Estimates section. With the Kapit resource largely defined and a Kapit reserve established, the levels of exploration activity and expenditure have been substantially reduced. Exploration will continue at this new lower level of activity and expenditure. E. Off-Balance Sheet arrangements The Company does not use off-balance sheet special purpose entities as a source of liquidity or for other financing purposes. F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations The profile of Lihirs contractual obligations to external parties as at December 31, 2006, is shown below: Later than 1 year Later than 2 years but not later than but not later than Total Less than 1 year 2 years 5 years More than 5 years $ 000 $ 000 $ 000 $ 000 $ 000 Project financing facility 215,520 26,940 44,900 143,680  Ballarat Goldfields facility 35,595 35,595    Revolving Credit Facility 30,000   30,000  Operating leases 5,349 971 749 1,302 2,327 Capital expenditure commitments 68 68    Other liabilities reflected on the Companys balance sheet* 427,396 175,399 45,531 205,289 1,177 Total in cash 713,928 238,973 91,180 380,271 3,504 * The majority of these liabilities are out-of-the-money hedge positions at December 31, 2006, totaling $332.8 million.

B. Compensation Non-Executive Directors Remuneration Total annual remuneration paid to all non-executive directors is limited to the aggregate amount of $750,000 authorized by the Companys shareholders. As the focus of the Board is on the long-term direction and well-being of the Company, there is no direct link between non-executive directors remuneration and the Companys short-term results. Non-executive directors do not receive any performance related remuneration. Remuneration is limited to the payment of board fees which serves to help maintain independence and impartiality. Remuneration is fixed rather than variable, and is determined with reference to the level of fees paid to board members of other PNG corporations, Australian corporations of comparable size, the complexity of the Companys operations and the workload requirements of Board members. The boards Remuneration and Nomination Committee has oversight of the fees paid to non-executive directors. External independent remuneration advisers are engaged by the Committee to provide advice on appropriate fee levels when these matters are being considered. Executive directors do not receive separate board fees as part of their remuneration packages. Details of the board fees paid to directors in respect of the year ended December 31, 2006 are set out below. No other benefits were paid or are payable to directors. The Company does not pay additional fees for membership or chairing of the Boards committees.

There are no schemes for retirement benefits for non-executive directors and no retirement benefits are payable by the Company to any director. - 55 - Table of Contents Senior management remuneration The Managing Director is supported by a number of senior executives who have responsibility for influencing the integrity, strategy, operations and financial performance of the Company. The Board, through its Remuneration and Nomination Committee, has annual oversight of the remuneration policies and terms of employment for all of the Companys senior executives. The Companys remuneration policy is in the process of being reviewed. However, the following broad principles continue to be applicable:  To provide total remuneration which is competitive in structure and quantum with comparator organizations so as to attract, retain and motivate appropriately qualified and experienced executives;  To achieve alignment between the structure of remuneration incentives for individual employees with shareholder value creation;  To tie variable elements of remuneration to the achievement of challenging performance criteria that are consistent with the best interests of the Company and shareholders; and  To provide an appropriate balance of fixed and variable or at-risk remuneration. In line with this, the Managing Directors remuneration package includes both a fixed component and an at-risk or performance related component (comprising both short-term and long-term incentives). The short-term incentive is annual and cash based, allowing the Managing Director to earn an amount equal to up to 50 percent of his base salary in the event the Board determines that the performance criteria established by it have been met. The performance criteria are set annually and include both financial and non-financial measures. These measures include specific targets related to gold production, production costs, cash flow and profitability, as well as targets relating to safety, environment and community relations criteria. In November 2006, the Managing Director received a salary increase of 20 percent due to his performance towards achieving the Companys goals and objectives. Further details of the Managing Directors employment terms and remuneration package are available on the Companys website. In addition, a long term incentive plan is included in the Managing Directors remuneration package, allowing him to receive an annual allocation of share rights equivalent in value to up to 55.56 percent of his base salary, based on a detailed set of performance hurdles focusing on contribution to the longer term value of the Company. The annual performance hurdle criteria relate to strategic corporate development, net present value increases, and to total shareholder returns assessed against both a comparator group and as a growth percentage. The long term incentive is designed to be provided by way of allocation of share rights approved by the Companys shareholders each year. At the annual general meeting in April 2006, shareholders approved the allocation of share rights to the Managing Director and other executives of the Company. On October 24, 2006, the Board assessed the Managing Director against certain of the performance hurdles previously set. The share rights associated with those performance hurdles amounted to 80 percent of the total share rights available, with the Board determining that 78 percent should vest. The remaining performance hurdle, amounting to 20 percent of the total share rights, is still to be assessed. On November 24, 2006 the Managing Director exercised his vested share rights. The Company acquired 176,071 shares on-market on behalf of the Managing Director with the shares being classified as restricted executive shares. The Managing Director entered into a Deed of Undertaking providing restrictions on dealing with any of those shares for a period of three years from the testing date. In November 2006, the Board allocated 136,530 share rights to Mr Arthur Hood, the Managing Director, for the 2006/07 year, subject to shareholder approval at the next Annual General Meeting. Mr Hoods employment contract provides for an award of share rights with effect on each anniversary of the date of his appointment as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, subject to shareholder approval. Separate approvals are to be sought each year, in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Australian Securities Exchange. The number of share rights allocated to the Managing Director was calculated in accordance with the Managing Directors employment contract. It represents the maximum number of shares that would be provided to Mr Hood in the event of optimum performance against all performance conditions. The testing date for the share rights to be granted to Mr Hood will be the first anniversary of the effective date of grant of the rights. For this grant, the effective date of grant is September 16, 2006. The share rights will be allocated in four separate tranches, each having different performance conditions. The performance conditions for each tranche are as follows: - 56 - Table of Contents Tranche 1  20% of the award will be subject to the Strategic Performance Condition This performance condition will be assessed by the Board against the Companys performance in developing corporate management and structures in line with Board policies to raise the long-term value of the Company. Tranche 2  20% of the award will be subject to the NPV Performance Condition This performance condition will be assessed by the Board against changes in the present value of the Company. This assessment is to have regard to the amount and timing of net expected cash flows, as indicated by reserves, costs and other relevant factors. Tranche 3  30% of the award will be subject to the Comparator TSR Performance Condition This performance condition will be assessed by the Board against the performance of the:  Companys average annual total shareholder return over the performance period against announcement date VWAP (expressed as a percentage); and  average annual total shareholder return of the Comparator Group over the performance period against the Comparator Groups VWAP on the announcement date (expressed as a percentage). If the Companys annual TSR when compared with the Comparator Groups annual TSR:  is greater by 10% or more, all of the rights subject to this condition will vest;  does not exceed the Comparator Groups, no rights subject to this condition will vest; or  is greater by less than 10%; a straight-line calculated proportion of the rights subject to this condition will vest. Tranche 4  30 % of the award will be subject to the TSR Growth Performance Condition Whether or not this performance condition is met will depend on the extent to which the Companys average annual total shareholder return increases over the performance period compared to the announcement date VWAP (expressed as a percentage). If the Companys TSR over the performance period increases by:  15% or more, Mr Hood will be entitled to all of the TSR growth shares;  5% or less, Mr Hood will not be entitled to any TSR growth shares; and  more than 5% but less than 15%, Mr Hood will be entitled to a pro rated number of TSR growth shares calculated on a straight line basis. For the purpose of the above table the announcement date VWAP is the volume weighted average sale price of all ordinary shares in the Company sold on the Australian Securities Exchange over the 20 trading days up to but excluding the date of announcement of Mr Hoods appointment as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. The Comparator Group currently comprise Newmont, Barrick, Newcrest, AngloGold, Oxiana, Goldfields (South Africa), Harmony, Sino Gold Mining and Kingsgate. The performance of the Comparator Group will be calculated using a simple unweighted average. The Board can adjust the composition of the Comparator Group and the way its performance is calculated, if the composition of the group changes materially. Total shareholder return is, broadly, share price growth and dividends reinvested, excluding the impact of franking credits and taxation. The performance period for Tranches 1 and 2 is the one-year period commencing on September 16, 2006 and ending on the testing date (which will be the anniversary of the effective date of the grant of the share rights). The performance period for Tranches 3 and 4 is the period commencing on the date of Mr Hoods appointment (September 16 2005) and ending on the testing date. Rights will only be tested as against the applicable performance conditions once (as at the testing date). There will be no further testing of rights after the initial testing. Mr Hood will be required to undertake in favour of the Company not to sell, encumber or otherwise dispose of shares acquired upon exercise of share rights before the third anniversary of the end of the performance period. Should Mr Hoods employment with the Company cease before the end of that restriction period, Mr Hood may be liable to forfeit his shares. During 2006, the remuneration packages for other executives consisted of a fixed component and an at-risk component. At risk remuneration comprises a short-term incentive payment (or STIP) and an equity based long-term incentive payment (or LTIP) on the terms of the Lihir Senior Executive Share Plan approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on April 24, 2006. The STIP is linked to specific operational and financial criteria developed for each executive based on judgment of relevant key business and improvement drivers for the year. Assessment of STIP performance against the criteria for 2006 is due to be undertaken in the first part of 2007. As is the case with the Managing Director, the LTIP performance hurdles are generally set by reference to external measures of the Companys performance as well as internal measures consistent with the duties and responsibilities of the executives concerned. The Remuneration and Nomination Committees assessment of executives of the Company against their performance hurdles for the LTIP is also due to be undertaken in the first part of 2007. - 57 - Table of Contents Short Term Other Share Based Base Superannuation Incentive/bonus benefits Payments Salary contribution Accrued Received Accrued Total Executive Officers $ $ $ $ $ $ Arthur Hood Managing Director 433,486 39,302 138,084 (1) 3,203 450,561 1,064,636 Paul Fulton (2) Chief Financial Officer 277,945 434,011 (12)  15,148  727,104 Jan Anderson (3) General Manager Operations 48,031 438,881 (13)  13,716  500,628 Mark Laurie (4) Company Secretary/ General Counsel, Manager Corporate & Towns 126,058 21,203 296,734 (5) (14) 54,841  498,836 Noel Foley (6) Executive General Manager 204,539 18,409 48,372  102,928 374,278 Murray Eagle General Manager External Affairs & Sustainable Development 227,447 22,495 53,580 (7) 6,267 116,457 426,246 Graham Folland (8) GM Corporate Development 173,716 15,634 37,693 139 88,225 315,406 Joe Dowling General Manager Corporate Affairs 163,959 17,231 53,205 (9) 7,155 77,197 318,746 Stuart MacKenzie (10) Group Secretary and General Counsel 58,061 5,226 17,276 5,810 21,169 107,539 Ron Yung (11) General Manager Organisation Performance 104,229 9,381 22,615 695 28,372 165,292 (1) This amount includes a bonus payment made to Mr Hood in 2006 in the amount of $35,156 which relates to services provided in 2005 (2) Mr Fulton ceased to be an executive on February 23, 2007 (3) Mr Anderson ceased to be an executive on February 22, 2006 (4) Mr Laurie ceased to be an executive on November 24, 2006 (5) Includes a bonus payment of $34,083 made to Mr Laurie in 2006 which relates to services provided in 2005 (6) Mr Foley commenced employment with the Company on January 13, 2006 (7) This amount includes a bonus payment made to Mr Eagle in 2006 in the amount of $12,118 which relates to services provided in 2005 (8) Mr Folland commenced employment with the Company on March 1, 2006.

The Company also participates in the National Superannuation Fund of Papua New Guinea in respect of its Papua New Guinean employees. The Company contributes to this fund at the statutory rate of 7.7% of salary, and contributions made during the year amounted to $1.0 million (2005: $0.9 million). This is a multi-employer plan, and members benefits are in the nature of defined contributions. - 58 - Table of Contents C. Board Practices Board of Directors The Board of Directors is responsible to shareholders for the overall performance of the Company and accordingly takes accountability for monitoring the Companys business and affairs and setting its strategic direction, establishing policies and overseeing the Companys financial position. Responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Company is delegated to the Managing Director and senior management. Certain fundamental powers and functions remained solely with the Board of Directors and are specifically excluded from the scope of duties of management. In summary, the Board is responsible and accountable for:  final approval of corporate strategy and performance objectives, resources and reserves and financial plans;  capital management, including capital raisings, approval and monitoring of significant capital expenditure;  monitoring of financial performance, review and approval of significant financial and other reporting;  assessing the appropriateness and adequacy of, and monitoring compliance with, corporate governance policies and ethical standards;  evaluating the performance of the senior management team;  determining the Companys risk management policies and reviewing and ratifying its risk management and internal control framework, including insurance, corporate security and prudential limits;  determining the Companys treasury policies, including gold price hedging, foreign currency and interest rate exposure; and  the engagement of auditors to review and report to the Board on the Companys financial results and reporting systems, internal controls and compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. Consistent with these principles, detailed formal delegations from the Board to management have been established. In carrying out its duties, the Board meets formally over one or two days at least five times per year. Additional meetings are held as required to address specific issues or as the need arises. Directors also participate in meetings of various Board committees, which assist the full Board in examining particular areas of interest. In 2006, the Board met 12 times and held an additional 29 committee meetings. Composition of the Board The directors (based on the recommendations of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee) determine the composition of the Board employing the following principles:  the Board may, in accordance with the Companys constitution, be comprised of a minimum of five directors and maximum of twelve; and  the roles of the Chairman of the Board and of Managing Director should be exercised by different individuals. The Company believes that the Board should comprise directors with a broad range of experience reflecting the character of the Companys business. The Board must be structured in such a way that it has proper understanding, and competency in, the current and emerging issues facing the Company, and can effectively review managements decisions. The Companys constitution requires one-third of the directors (or the next lowest whole number) to retire by rotation at each annual general meeting (AGM). The directors to retire at each AGM are those who have been longest in office since their last election. Where directors have served for equal periods, they may agree amongst themselves or determine by lot who will retire. A director must retire in any event at the third AGM since he or she was last elected or re-elected. Retiring directors may offer themselves for re-election. A director appointed as an additional or casual director by the Board will hold office until the next AGM when they may be re-elected. The Managing Director is not subject to retirement by rotation and, along with any director appointed as an additional or casual director, is not to be taken into account in determining the number of directors required to retire by rotation. The Board is currently comprised of eight directors. During 2006, Mr John OReilly ceased to hold office (on December 31, 2006). In March 2007, Mr Alister Maitland and Dr Michael Etheridge were appointed by the Board as additional directors following the successful merger of the Company with Ballarat. Details of the directors at the date of this Annual Report are as follows: - 59 - Table of Contents Year Appointed Name Position As Director Term Ends Ross Garnaut Chairman of Board, Independent Director Member of Audit Committee Member of Environmental and Lihir Impact Committee Chairman of Remuneration and Nomination Committee 1995 Geoffrey Loudon Independent Director Member of Safety and Technical Committee Member of Environmental and Lihir Impact Committee 1995 Peter Cassidy Independent Director Chairman of Safety and Technical Committee Member of Remuneration and Nomination Committee 2003 Winifred Kamit Independent Director 2004 Chair of Environmental and Lihir Impact Committee Member of Audit Committee Member of Remuneration and Nomination Committee Arthur Hood Managing Director 2005 October 1, 2010 Bruce Brook Independent Director Chairman of Audit Committee Member of Safety and Technical Committee 2005 Michael Etheridge Independent Director 2007 Alister Maitland Independent Director 2007 At the Annual General Meeting to be held on April 24, 2007, Dr Cassidy, Mr Loudon, Dr Etheridge and Mr Maitland will retire and offer themselves for re-election. Directors Service Contracts Providing for Benefits on Termination of Contract The Companys non-executive directors have no entitlements to benefits on termination as members of the board. The Managing Directors service contract provides that if the Company terminates his employment or he resigns after there is a significant diminution of his role, status or reporting lines (other than with his agreement), then the Company must pay him the sum determined by multiplying $925,000 by the relevant multiple. For this purpose, the relevant multiple is set out below: If employment is terminated... ...the relevant multiple is... Before October 1, 2006 3 Between October 1, 2006 and September 30, 2008 The number of whole months in the period commencing on the day after the date of termination of employment and ending on October 1, 2010, divided by 24. Between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2010 1 or, if the date of termination of employment is after October 1, 2009, the relevant multiple is a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months in the period commencing the day after the date of termination of employment and the denominator of which is 12. Board committees To assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities, the Board has established four standing committees to consider certain issues and functions in greater detail. The standing committees are:  Audit;  Remuneration and Nomination;  Environmental and Lihir Impact; and  Safety and Technical. The chairman of each committee reports on any matters of substance at the next full meeting of the Board. Committees provide recommendations to the Board. Other committees are established on an ad hoc basis from time to time to deal with specific matters. - 60 - Table of Contents Audit committee The Company has had an Audit Committee since 1995. Members of the Audit Committee at the date of this report are: Mr Bruce Brook  Committee Chairman Dr Ross Garnaut Mrs Winifred Kamit All three members of the Committee are independent, non-executive directors. The Committee has appropriate financial expertise and all members are financially literate and have an appropriate understanding of the industry in which the Company operates. The Managing Director attends Committee meetings in an advisory role at the Committees invitation. However, specific sessions are held with the Companys internal and external auditors independent of the Managing Director and of management. The Group Secretary attends all Committee meetings. The function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities associated with the preparation and independent audit of the Companys accounts, its external financial reporting, its internal control structure, risk management systems and audit function, primarily by: (a) determining the appropriateness of accounting principles and disclosure practices adopted by management and monitoring compliance with applicable accounting standards and other requirements; (b) overseeing the preparation and audit of, and verifying and ensuring the integrity of, the Companys financial statements and reports; (c) the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the Companys external auditor or any other public accounting firm engaged for the purpose of performing audit, review or attestation services for the Company; (d) reviewing and evaluating the independence, qualifications and performance of the external auditor and managing the relationship between the Company and its external auditor; (e) monitoring the adequacy of the Companys internal financial controls, risk management, and compliance systems and processes; (f) overseeing the retention, tasking and resourcing of the Companys internal auditors, monitoring their progress and evaluating their performance; and (g) reviewing the financial management of the Company generally and undertaking such other tasks as the Board or the Managing Director may request from time to time. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Committee has rights of access to management and to auditors (external and internal) without management present and may seek explanations and additional information. The Committee may engage any independent advisers in relation to any matter pertaining to the powers, duties and responsibilities of the Committee. The Audit Committee operates in accordance with a charter published in the corporate governance section of the Companys website. See Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert for a discussion of the Companys Audit Committees financial expert as defined by the SEC. Auditor independence The charter adopted by the Audit Committee confirms its direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the Companys external auditors. In order to ensure the independence of the external auditor, the Audit Committee:  requires that no person may play a significant role in managing the audit for more than five out of any seven successive years;  must approve all non audit work which may be undertaken by the external auditor and exclude them from undertaking such work where it may give rise to a conflict of interest;  receives periodic statements, at least annually, from the auditors outlining all work undertaken for the Lihir Gold, and confirming that the auditor has satisfied all professional regulations relating to auditor independence; and  meets with the external auditor independently of management. Risk oversight and management The Board, through the Audit Committee, is responsible for ensuring that there are adequate policies in place in relation to risk management, compliance and internal control systems. The Companys policies are designed to ensure that strategic, operational, legal, reputation and financial risks are identified, assessed and managed to facilitate achievement of the Companys business objectives. The Audit Committees charter defines the Committees responsibilities in relation to risk management and includes specific and detailed reference to management of the internal audit function. The Companys internal audit function, which is carried out by KPMG under the supervision of the Audit Committee, performs regular reviews on significant areas of risk within the Companys operations to ensure that the internal control plan work is adequate and effective. The internal audit plan is approved by the Audit Committee at least annually and reviewed regularly. The internal auditor submits regular reports to the Chief Financial Officer, to the Audit Committee and, where appropriate, to the Board. Internal control systems and practices are reviewed to ensure compliance with US Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. - 61 - Table of Contents Remuneration and nomination committee The Board has had a Remuneration Committee since 1995. The Committees mandate was widened in 1997 to become a Remuneration and Nomination Committee. Members of the Committee at the date of this report are: Dr Ross Garnaut  Committee Chairman Dr Peter Cassidy Mrs Winifred Kamit All three members of the Committee are independent, non-executive directors. Under its charter, the Committee is responsible for:  reviewing remuneration of non-executive directors, the Managing Director and other senior executives;  establishing criteria for membership of the Board and its committees, and processes for the identification of suitable candidates;  reviewing membership of the board and its committees;  nominating members of the board and its committees;  formulating policies relating to the retirement of non-executive directors;  reviewing management succession planning, reviewing human resources and remuneration policies for the Company generally; and  ensuring the Companys obligations in relation to employee benefits and entitlements, including superannuation, are met. The Managing Director or other members of management may also attend meetings of the Committee at the invitation of the Committee Chairman, whenever particular matters arise that require management participation. However members of management must not participate in the deliberations of the Committee involving matters affecting their position or personal interest. The Group Secretary attends all meetings of the Committee. The Committee charter is available on the Companys website. The Committee reports and recommends to the Board on the above issues, with final determinations made by the board. Environmental and Lihir Impact Committee The Board established this Committee in 1995. Members of the Committee at the date of this report are: Mrs Winifred Kamit  Committee Chairperson Dr Ross Garnaut Mr Geoff Loudon Mr John OReilly served as a member of the Committee until his retirement on December 31, 2006. This Committee meets quarterly and monitors environmental, social and community issues and impacts of the Companys operations on Lihir Island. Reviews are undertaken on the effectiveness of managements policies and practices relating to:  the interaction between the Companys activities and the local community, and the ways in which these activities contribute to social and economic development;  policies and practices followed in dealings with the local community in relation to land;  maintaining and improving community health; and  the impact and associated risks of the Companys activities on the natural marine, atmospheric and terrestrial environment, together with monitoring compliance with the applicable regulatory regime. The Committees focus is on the quality, effectiveness and transparency of these management processes. It also reviews specific issues of significance from time to time. This Committee charter is yet to be formalised although its role, functions and methods of operation are well established. A formal charter is being developed. Safety and Technical Committee The Board established this Committee in 2005. Members of the Committee at the date of this report are: Dr Peter Cassidy  Committee Chairman Mr Geoff Loudon Mr Bruce Brook Mr John OReilly served as a member of this Committee until his resignation on December 31, 2006. Mr Brook was appointed by the Board in January 2007 to fill the vacancy left by Mr OReillys retirement. The Committee meets quarterly and monitors: - 62 - Table of Contents  occupational health and safety standards, policies and issues;  technical issues associated with the Companys exploration, mining and processing activities, with reference to the standards set by the Company and the standards and norms of the industry more generally; and  the status of major capital projects approved by the Board. The Committee charter is available on the Companys website. D. Employees The numbers of employees and contractors at the end of the last three fiscal years are summarized below: 2006 2005 2004 Management 12 14 13 Commercial, human resources, towns and site services, community and environment 450 340 300 Mining operations and mine technical 642 414 407 Plant operations and maintenance 455 359 350 LSA 28 Total Lihir employees 1,587 1,127 1,070 Total contractors (full-time equivalent) 2,250 1,506 1,500 Total 3,837 2,633 2,570 For details of the senior management team, see Item 6  A. Directors and Senior Management. The increase in non production employee numbers was primarily due to two factors. Firstly there was a significant increase in the trainee intake (within human resources) in line with the increased focus on localisation whilst additional services staff were necessary to support the activities associated with construction. Mining staff increased as a result of additional equipment and additional resources in key technical areas, whilst increased plant numbers were primarily due to the flotation expansion. The increase in contractor numbers is primarily a result of the construction of the flotation plant and the additional 20MW geothermal power plant. See 
