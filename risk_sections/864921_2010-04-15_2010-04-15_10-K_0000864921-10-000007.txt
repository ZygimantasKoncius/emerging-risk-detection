Item 1A. Risk Factors: Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, which are described below. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not described or not known to management of the Company may also impair business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. AUDITORS HAVE EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. In their report dated April 15, 2010 Liebman Goldberg & Hymowitz LLP., stated that our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is an issue raised as a result of recurring losses from operations. We have experienced net operating losses and our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to maintain and enhance our profitability. During 2009, the Company changed its auditors to Liebman Goldberg & Hymowitz LLP from Morgenstern, Svoboda and Bear, CPA, P.C. WE HAVE ACCUMULATED LOSSES AND ARE NOT CURRENTLY PROFITABLE. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately $47.7 million as of December 31, 2009 and are currently experiencing negative cash flow. We expect to continue to experience negative cash flow and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to make significant expenditures for acquisitions, sales and marketing, infrastructure development and general and administrative functions. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability. If our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses exceed expectations, we may experience reduced profitability. A large portion of our annual income (loss) is attributable to the adjustment of the derivative liability associated with the fair market value of the embedded derivatives which is based on the market price of our Common Stock. IF WE ARE REQUIRED FOR ANY REASON TO REPAY OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DEPLETE OUR WORKING CAPITAL, IF AVAILABLE, OR RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. OUR FAILURE TO REPAY THE CALLABLE SECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES, IF REQUIRED, COULD RESULT IN LEGAL ACTION AGAINST US, WHICH COULD REQUIRE THE SALE OF SUBSTANTIAL ALL OF OUR ASSETS. During the period from December 28, 2005 through December 31, 2009 the Company entered into a series of financing arrangements involving the aggregate sale of approximately $4.5 million in principal amount of convertible debentures and warrants to purchase 500,230 shares of our Common Stock. We have received Notices of Default relating to our Callable Secured Convertible Notes. A default on these debt obligations could result in foreclosure on all of our assets. See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings. The convertible debentures are due and payable, with interest, unless sooner converted into shares of our Common Stock at various dates though 2012. In addition, any event of default such as our failure to repay the principal or interest when due, our failure to issue shares of Common Stock upon receipt of a notice of conversion from the holder, our failure to timely file a registration statement or have such registration statement declared effective, breach of any covenant, representation or warranty in the Securities Purchase Agreement or related convertible note, the assignment or appointment of a receiver to control a substantial part of our property or business, the filing of a money judgment, writ or similar process against us in excess of $50,000, the commencement of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or liquidation proceeding against us and the delisting of our Common Stock could require the early repayment of the convertible debentures, including a default interest rate of 15% on the outstanding principal balance of the notes if the default is not cured within the specified grace period and as of the end of the last fiscal quarter the amount to repay the convertible debentures would cost an aggregate of approximately $4.0 million. We anticipate that the full amount of the convertible debentures will be converted into shares of our Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the convertible debentures. If we are required to repay the convertible debentures, we would be required to use our limited working capital and raise additional funds. If we were unable to repay the notes when required, the note holders could commence legal action against us and foreclose on all of our assets to recover the amounts due. Any such action would require us to curtail or cease operations. - 4 - - On December 18, 2009, Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York Index No. 603782/09, New Millennium Capital Partners III, LLC; ASW Partners, LLC; ASW Offshore II, Ltd.; ASW Qualified Partners II, LLC; ASW Master Fund II, Ltd.; filed an action entitled New Millennium, et. al. versus Juniper Group, Inc. in the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York. The complaint alleges breach of the terms of certain convertible debentures and seeks equitable relief and monetary damages of $7.46 million. Juniper has denied the allegations in the complaint and asserted counterclaims. A motion for preliminary injunctive relief is pending. While no estimate of the outcome can be made, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses and will prevail in this matter. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these claims. We currently do not have the funds to repay these Notes and if we are unsuccessful in defending their claims, New Millennium et. al. could foreclose on our assets. New Millennium et. al. is the note holder of our Callable Secured Convertible Notes with outstanding principal at December 31, 2009 of approximately $2.6 million. WE COULD HAVE UNFAVORABLE HEALTH INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIM EXPERIENCES. If a customer does not pay us, or if the costs of benefits we provide to worksite employees, exceed the fees a client pays us, our ultimate liability for worksite employee’s payroll and benefits costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. OUR COMMON STOCK TRADES IN A LIMITED PUBLIC MARKET, THE NASD OTC ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARD; AND IN ADDITION THERE ARE VARIOUS INDUSTRY FACTORS, WHICH COULD CAUSE INVESTORS TO FACE POSSIBLE VOLATILITY OF SHARE PRICE. Our Common Stock is currently quoted on the NASD OTC Bulletin Board under the ticker symbol JUNP.OB. As of April 12, 2010 there were 142,158,246 shares of common stock outstanding, approximately all were tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. Various industry factors could cause volatility in the market price of our shares. Factors such as, but not limited to, technological innovations, new products, acquisitions or strategic alliances entered into by us or our competitors, government regulatory action, patent or proprietary rights developments, and market conditions for penny stocks in general could have a material effect on the liquidity of our Common Stock and volatility of our stock price. MANY OF THE INDUSTRIES WE SERVE ARE SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATION AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL AND REGULATORY CHANGE, AND OUR INABILITY OR FAILURE TO ADJUST TO OUR CUSTOMERS’ CHANGING NEEDS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES. We derive, and anticipate that we will continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the wireless telecommunications industry. The wireless telecommunications industry is subject to rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation. Changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide. New or developing technologies could displace the wireless systems used for the transmission of voice, video and data, and improvements in existing technology may allow communications providers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Additionally, the communications industry has been characterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our major customers. Our success depends also on the continued trend by our customers to outsource their needs. If this trend does not continue or if our customers elect to perform the deployment services themselves, our operating results may decline. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WHICH MAY REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE AND HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. The telecommunications industry is highly fragmented, and we compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate, ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets. We also face competition from existing or prospective customers that employ in-house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide. There are relatively few barriers to entry into the industry in which we operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become a competitor. MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS DO NOT OBLIGATE OUR CUSTOMERS TO UNDERTAKE ANY WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OR OTHER WORK WITH US. A significant portion of our revenue is derived pursuant to master service agreements. Under these master service agreements, we contract to provide customers with individual project services, through purchase orders, within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis. Under these agreements, our customers have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work - 5 - - with us. A significant decline in the projects customers assign to us under these master service agreements could result in a decline in our revenue, profitability and liquidity. In addition, certain of our customers are themselves construction companies and general contractors employed by providers of wireless telecommunication services. As a result, our exposure due to the loss of a particular customer may be greater on an indirect basis than described herein. WE MAY NOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER CONTRACTS WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. A substantial portion of our revenues in 2009 and 2008 were derived from master service agreements. Under these contracts, the customer sets the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services. These costs may be affected by a variety of factors, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor. Certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated or losses if actual costs for our contracts exceed our estimates, which could reduce our profitability and liquidity. THE CONCENTRATION OF OUR BUSINESS AMONG LARGE CUSTOMERS COULD INCREASE CREDIT RISKS. The concentration of a portion of our business among a number of large customers increases our potential credit risks. One or more of these customers could delay payments or default on credit extended to them. Any significant delay in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources, possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults. Any significant default could result in significantly decreased earning and material and adversely affect our businesses financial condition and results of operations. Revenues derived from one major customer accounted for 81.2% of our 2009 total revenues. THE PROVISION OF SERVICES FOR WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT IS SEASONAL AND IS AFFECTED BY ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE SPENDING PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, EXPOSING US TO VARIABLE QUARTERLY RESULTS. The provision of services for wireless infrastructure services deployment is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers, exposing the Company to variable quarterly results. Inclement weather may lower the demand for our service in the winter months, as well as other times of the year. Furthermore, the weather can delay the completion of projects already started in addition to delaying the commission of new projects. Therefore, we cannot predict that the financial results for any particular quarter will be the same for any other quarter. Natural catastrophes, such as the hurricanes and snowstorms, could also have a negative impact on the overall economy and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions, which in turn could significantly impact the results of any one or more reporting periods. OUR BUSINESS REQUIRES THE DEPLOYMENT OF SERVICE VEHICLES THROUGHOUT THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES AND INCREASES IN THE COST OF FUEL COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. The price of fuel needed to operate our service vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing. Accordingly, any increase in fuel costs could reduce our profitability and liquidity. WE MAY CHOOSE, OR BE REQUIRED, TO PAY OUR SUBCONTRACTORS OR STAFFING AGENCIES EVEN IF OUR CUSTOMERS DO NOT PAY, OR DELAY PAYING, US FOR THE RELATED SERVICES. We use subcontractors or staffing agencies to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow. In some cases, we pay our subcontractors or staffing agencies before our customers pay us for the related services. If we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors or staffing agencies for work performed for customers who fail to pay, or delay paying, us for the related work, we could experience a decrease in profitability and liquidity. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE OFTEN LARGE COMPANIES THAT HAVE SUPERIOR BARGAINING STRENGTH Most of our customers are large companies that have a greater bargaining position than we do in negotiating contracts due to the potential value to us of obtaining their business and the intense competition we face to obtain that business. This unequal - 6 - - bargaining position could result in our acceptance of less favorable contract terms than we might otherwise accept, reduced operating margins and material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. THE DEVELOPMENT AND INSTALLATION OF WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES REQUIRES UNDERGROUND WORK, WHICH REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES. Some of the work we perform is in underground environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants. In such a case, we may be liable for fines and damages. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could negatively impact our profitability and liquidity. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO HAZARDS THAT COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND WEAKEN OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. Deployment, construction and maintenance of wireless communication towers undertaken by our employees involve exposure to electrical lines, heavy equipment, mechanical failures and adverse weather conditions. If serious accidents or fatalities occur, we may be restricted from bidding on certain work and certain existing contracts could be terminated. In addition, if our safety record were to deteriorate, our ability to bid on certain work could suffer. The occurrence of accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new contracts with customers, which could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity. MANY OF OUR WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CUSTOMERS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED AND THE ADDITION OF NEW REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO EXISTING REGULATIONS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THEIR DEMAND FOR OUR SPECIALTY CONTRACTING SERVICES AND THE PROFITABILITY OF THOSE SERVICES. Many of our wireless telecommunications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC may interpret the application of its regulations to telecommunication companies in a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, then demand for our specialty contracting services may be reduced. THE CURRENT AND CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR OPERATIONS IS CONTINGENT ON OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT EMPLOYEES. In the event we are able to obtain necessary funding, we expect to experience significant growth in the number of employees and the scope of our operations. In particular, we may hire additional sales, marketing and administrative personnel. Additionally, acquisitions could result in an increase in employee headcount and business activity. Such activities could result in increased responsibilities for management. We believe that our ability to increase our customer support capability and to attract, train, and retain qualified technical, sales, marketing, and management personnel, will be a critical factor to our future success. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE STAFFING LEVELS RELATED TO OUR BILLABLE WORKFORCE. If we maintain or increase billable staffing levels in anticipation of one or more projects and those projects are delayed, reduced or terminated, or otherwise do not materialize, we may underutilize these personnel, which could have material, adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS CONSTANTLY GROWING AND EVOLVING. ACCORDINGLY OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. Our future success depends upon our ability to address potential market opportunities while managing our expenses to match our ability to finance our operations. This need to manage our expenses will place a significant strain on our management and operational resources. If we are unable to manage our expenses effectively, we may be unable to finance our operations. By adjusting our operations and development to the level of capitalization, we believe we have sufficient capital resources to meet projected cash flow deficits. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient liquidity from operations or in raising sufficient capital resources, on terms acceptable to us, this could have a material adverse effect on - 7 - - our business, results of operations liquidity and financial condition and would prevent us from being able to utilize potential market opportunities. OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON GROWTH IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF WIRLESS NETWORKS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES, AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH GROWTH SLOWS, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED. Telecommunications carriers are constantly re-evaluating their network deployment plans in response to trends in the capital markets, changing perceptions regarding industry growth, the adoption of new wireless technology, increasing pricing competition for subscribers and general economic conditions in the United States. If the rate of network deployment slows and carriers reduce their capital investment in wireless infrastructure build-outs or fail to expand into new geographic areas, our business may be significantly harmed. The uncertainty associated with rapidly changing telecommunications technology may also negatively impact the rate of deployment of wireless networks and the demand for our services. Telecommunications services providers face significant challenges in assessing consumer demand and in acceptance of rapidly changing enhanced telecommunications capabilities. If telecommunications services providers perceive that the rate of acceptance of the next generation telecommunications product will grow more slowly than previously expected, they may, as a result, slow their development of the next generation technologies. Moreover, increasing price competition for subscribers could adversely affect the profitability of carriers and limit their resources for network deployment. Any significant sustained slowdown will further reduce the demand for our services and adversely affect our financial results. THE DEPARTURE OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS, AND FEW OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL ARE CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO STAY WITH US. We depend on the continued efforts of our officers and senior management. This includes director of operations, director of business development, and construction project managers. The loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. THE REQUIREMENTS OF BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY MAY STRAIN OUR RESOURCES AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT TIME AND ATTENTION. As a public company we are subject the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of the rules and regulations have increased, and may further increase in the future, our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our systems and resources. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and other periodic reports with respect to our business and financial conditions. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we report on the effectiveness of our disclosures controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified independent members of our Board of Directors and qualified member of our management team. WE SHALL BE REQUIRED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL MEANS OF FINANCING. During the period from December 28, 2005 through December 31, 2009 the Company entered into a series of financing arrangements involving the sale of an approximately of $3.7 million in principal amount of Convertible Debentures. In addition, during 2009, the Company issued approximately $784,000 in principal amounts of convertible debentures in exchange for cash proceeds, goods and services and $145,000 in proceeds from the payment related to a note receivable. There can be no assurance that we will generate adequate revenues from operations to finance operations and the failure to generate sufficient operating revenues would have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future operating and capital requirements will vary based on a number of factors, including the level of sales and marketing activities for our services and products. Accordingly, we may be required to obtain additional private or public financing including debt or equity financing and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available as needed, or, if available, on terms favorable to us. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, existing stockholders may experience a dilution in their ownership. In addition, as a condition to giving additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Furthermore, debt financing, if available, will require payment of interest and may involve restrictive covenants that could impose limitations on our operating flexibility. Our failure to successfully obtain additional future funding may jeopardize our ability to continue our business and operations. - 8 - - SERVICES FOR WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE DEPLOYMENT ARE PROVIDED BY BOTH IN-HOUSE SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AND OUTSOURCED SUPPORT PROVIDERS AND MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE LARGER AND HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE DO AND THOSE ADVANTAGES COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPETE WITH THEM. Many of our current and potential competitors may have substantial competitive advantages relative to us, including: · longer operating histories; · significantly greater financial resources; · greater technical and marketing resources; · greater brand name recognition; and · a larger existing customer bases. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and to devote greater resources to develop, promote and sell their services than we can. If we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to grow our business. The Company may not be able to identify and complete potential acquisition candidates. If we do identify potential acquisition candidates, there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire such candidates on appropriate terms. RISKS RELATING TO OUR CURRENT FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS: THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES UNDERLYING OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE SALE AND THE SALE OF THESE SHARES MAY DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. As of April 12, 2010 we had 142,158,246 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and various convertible debentures outstanding or an obligation to issue convertible debentures that may be converted into an estimated 893,818,779 shares of Common Stock at current market prices. In addition, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding convertible debentures may increase if the market price of our stock declines. All of the shares, including all of the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible debentures and upon exercise of our warrants and options, may be sold without restriction. The sale of these shares may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. In addition to the foregoing shares, we currently have 25,357 shares of 12% Non-voting Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding, 106,667 shares of Series B Voting Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding, and 300,000 shares of Series C Voting Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding, which are not currently convertible into shares of Common Stock, however, if these shares were convertible, based on the current market price, the outstanding convertible preferred stock would be convertible into approximately 321,740,000 shares of our Common Stock. Our obligation to issue shares of our Common Stock upon conversion of our Convertible Debentures and preferred stock is essentially limitless. As such we may not have sufficient shares of authorized Common Stock to convert all of the outstanding Convertible Debentures and preferred stock. This could affect our ability to raise additional funds. THE CONTINUOUSLY ADJUSTABLE CONVERSION PRICE FEATURE OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES MAY ENCOURAGE INVESTORS TO MAKE SHORT SALES IN OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. The convertible debentures are convertible into shares of our Common Stock at discounts to the trading price of the Common Stock prior to the conversion ranging from 40% to 72%. The significant downward pressure on the price of the Common Stock as the selling stockholder converts and sells material amounts of Common Stock could encourage short sales by third party investors. These sales could place further downward pressure on the price of the Common Stock. The selling stockholder could sell Common Stock into the market in anticipation of covering the short sale by converting their securities, which could cause further downward pressure on the stock price. In addition, not only the sale of shares issued upon conversion or exercise of notes, warrants and options, but also the mere perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES UPON CONVERSION OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES MAY CAUSE IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. The issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the convertible debentures may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders since the selling stockholders may ultimately convert and sell the full amount issuable on - 9 - - conversion. Although the selling stockholders may not convert their convertible debentures if such conversion or exercise would cause them to own more than 4.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, this restriction does not prevent the selling stockholders from converting some of their holdings, selling those shares and then converting the rest of their holdings. In this way, the selling stockholders could convert and sell their holdings while never owning more than 4.99% of our Common Stock at any one time. There is no upper limit on the number of shares that may be issued which will have the effect of further diluting the proportionate equity interest and voting power of holders of our Common Stock. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING UNDER THE SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WE WILL NEED TO SATISFY CERTAIN CLOSING CONDITIONS AND IF THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED AND WE DO NOT OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING, WE WILL HAVE TO REDUCE STAFF AND CURTAIL OUR OPERATIONS. Pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreements, if we were able to raise additional financing from another source, we would need to satisfy certain terms and conditions as stipulated in the Securities Purchase Agreements. In the event that the terms and conditions are not satisfied, we may not be able to obtain additional financing from another source. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional financing and meeting the terms and conditions. If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms or if we are unable to meet the terms and conditions in the Securities Purchase Agreements, we may need to reduce staff and curtail our operations. RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK: WE HAVE HAD TO FILE FOR EXTENSIONS FOR OUR RECENT ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY FILINGS AND IF WE FAIL TO REMAIN CURRENT ON OUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO SELL OUR SECURITIES AND THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. Companies trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, such as us, must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and must be current in their reports under Section 13, in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTC Bulletin Board. If we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTC Bulletin Board. As a result, the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market. OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO THE "PENNY STOCK" RULES OF THE SEC AND THE TRADING MARKET IN OUR SECURITIES IS LIMITED, WHICH MAKES TRANSACTIONS IN OUR STOCK CUMBERSOME AND MAY REDUCE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a "penny stock," for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: · that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks; and · that the broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: · obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and · make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: · sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and · that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the "penny stock" rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our Common Stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. - 10 - - Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading, about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item
