RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below, in conjunction with the other information and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, before making an investment decision. You should pay particular attention to the fact that we conduct our operations in Italy and are governed by a legal and regulatory environment that in some respects differs significantly from the environment that prevails in other countries with which you may be familiar. Our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be affected materially and adversely by any or all of these risks. In that event, the market price of our ADSs could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to Our Business We do not currently have any regulatory approvals to sell defibrotide to treat or prevent VOD, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to commercialize defibrotide to treat or prevent VOD anywhere in the world. Obtaining regulatory approval has been and continues to be increasingly difficult and costly and takes many years, and, once obtained, is costly to maintain. With the occurrence of a number of high profile safety events with certain pharmaceutical products, regulatory authorities, and in particular the FDA, members of Congress, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congressional committees, private health/science foundations and organizations, medical professionals, including physicians and investigators, and the general public are increasingly concerned about potential or perceived safety issues associated with pharmaceutical and biological products, whether under study for initial approval or already marketed. This increasing concern has produced greater scrutiny, which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, as well as more restrictive labeling of a product or a class of products for safety reasons, potentially including a boxed warning or additional limitations on the use of products, pharmacovigilance programs for approved products or requirement of risk management activities related to the promotion and sale of a product. On May 10, 2011, we announced the filing of our MAA under a centralized procedure with the EMA for defibrotide for the treatment and prevention of VOD in adults and children. On March 21, 2013, the EMA announced its decision to deny the approval of our MAA. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, which reviewed the MAA, concluded that there were issues with certain documentation and the reporting of data in the prevention study. In the treatment study, the number of patients in the historical control group was considered to be too low and the CHMP was concerned about the fact that some patients who were originally chosen to be in the historical control group were excluded from the study. In addition, the CHMP concluded that there was a lack of data on the way the medicine is eliminated by the kidneys in children and patients with reduced kidney function, which concerned the CHMP since a safety concern was identified in children who received high doses of defibrotide. We plan to appeal the EMA’s decision and explore all possible options, including conducting additional clinical studies, with respect to obtaining regulatory approval from the EMA for defibrotide. In addition, on August 17, 2011, we voluntarily withdrew our NDA with the FDA following correspondence from the FDA identifying several potential “Refuse to File” issues regarding, among other things, the completeness and accuracy of our datasets. We have been working with CROs and consultants to address the issues raised by the FDA and plan to resubmit our NDA in 2013. We do not currently have regulatory approval to market and sell defibrotide anywhere in the world, and we may never obtain regulatory approval to market and sell defibrotide. While we have generated revenue on the distribution of defibrotide through our cost recovery and named-patient programs, we cannot guarantee that historical revenues from these programs will continue or whether we will be able to continue to distribute defibrotide on a pre-approval basis. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to commercialize defibrotide or unable to distribute defibrotide on a pre-approval basis, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. The FDA and EMA may require us to conduct additional clinical trials for defibrotide to treat VOD or prevent VOD and/or collect additional data, which will delay the commercialization of defibrotide and may require us to obtain additional capital. The EMA and the FDA may require us to conduct one or more additional clinical trials prior to granting marketing approval for defibrotide. In addition, for the treatment indication, these regulators may require us to conduct a trial that requires a concurrent control group of untreated patients as opposed to a historical control arm, which may not be possible if patients are unwilling to enroll and/or investogators refuse to participate in such a trial. Conducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Our ability to complete any clinical trials in a timely fashion will depend in large part on a number of key factors, including protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval, the rate of patient enrollment in clinical trials, and compliance with extensive current Good Clinical Practices requirements. We have opened clinical sites and have enrolled patients in a number of new countries where our experience is more limited, and have required the use of the services of third party clinical trial service providers. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of any new clinical trials, our studies and ultimately our regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates altogether. 6 We may lack sufficient capital to commence and complete new clinical studies for defibrotide. Obtaining additional capital through equity and/or debt financings, loans or collaborative arrangements with corporate partners may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain additional capital to conduct additional clinical trials for defibrotide, these studies will take years to complete. While we have generated limited revenue from sales of defibrotide on a pre-approval basis, we have had significant losses to date, and we may not be able to meet our future cash requirements without obtaining additional capital from external sources or if we are prevented from or unsuccessful in distributing defibrotide on a pre-approval basis. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately €12.49 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have generated a significant portion of our revenue through the distribution of defibrotide on a pre-approval basis through our cost recovery and named-patient programs. Prior to the initiation of our cost recovery and named-patient programs, we were cash-flow negative and had only generated net losses. We may revert to incurring significant losses and may become cash-flow negative, particularly if we are required to conduct additional clinical studies, or if we are prevented from or unnuccessful in distributing defibrotide on a pre-approval basis. If we incur operating losses and become cash-flow negative for longer than we expect to and are unable to raise additional capital, we may become insolvent and unable to continue our operations. In addition, our fluctuating operating results may fail to meet the expectations of investors, which may cause the price of our ADSs to decline. Our failure to raise additional funds in the future may delay the development of defibrotide. The development of defibrotide has required a commitment of substantial funds and we may need to commit a substantial amount of additional funds in order to obtain regulatory approval to market and commercialize defibrotide. Our long-term capital requirements are dependent upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: · the timing and cost to develop and obtain regulatory approvals to market defibrotide, including the potential need to conduct future clinical trials; · future payments, if any, received or made under existing or possible future collaborative arrangements; · our ability to continue to distribute defibrotide under our named-patient and cost recovery programs; · the costs associated with building and maintaining a commercial infrastructure; · the costs associated with implementing any upgrades to our manufacturing facility as required by the FDA, the EMA, or any other regulatory body; · the costs associated with protecting and expanding our patent and other intellectual property rights; · market acceptance of defibrotide; and · the overall condition of the financial markets. We cannot assure you that funds will be available to us in the future on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on terms that we find acceptable, or at all, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate research and development efforts with respect to defibrotide. We may also be forced to curtail, cease or restructure our operations, enter into new funding arrangements with collaborators on unattractive terms, or relinquish rights to defibrotide that we would not otherwise relinquish in order to continue operating independently. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market defibrotide, we do not know whether we will ever generate significant revenues. Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market defibrotide, we may have very limited markets and may not generate enough revenues from defibrotide to fund our business. The FDA, EMA and KFDA have designated defibrotide to treat and prevent VOD, as “orphan drugs,” which generally means that fewer than 200,000 people are affected by the disease or condition. If we are unable to distribute defibrotide at our expected price-points to this limited market, we may never generate significant revenue. Following regulatory approval for defibrotide, if any, we plan on marketing and distributing defibrotide in major countries throughout Europe through our subsidiary, Gentium GmbH. However, we have alliances with regional partners to assist us with the distribution of defibrotide in certain territories post-approval, including an alliance with Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to market defibrotide for the treatment and prevention of VOD in North America, Central America and South America. Our future profitability may depend largely on our partners’ efforts to market defibrotide, which may not be successful. 7 If we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs and penalties. Our activities, and the activities of our collaborators and third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting and product risk management. These risks may be heightened if we obtain regulatory approval for defibrotide. Regulations governing the health care industry are subject to change, including: • new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, pricing or marketing practices, compliance with wage and hour laws and other employment practices, method of delivery, payment for health care products and services, tracking payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and extensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption prohibitions; • changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity; • changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products; and • changes in the tax laws relating to our operations. While these regulations may not impact our business directly, they may impact Sigma-Tau’s distribution of defibrotide in the Americas, which would impact our royalty revenues upon FDA approval, if any. We may be required to suspend or discontinue any current and future clinical trials due to adverse events or other safety issues that could preclude approval of defibrotide and negatively affect our business model and stock price. If we are required to conduct any future clinical trials for defibrotide, the trials may be suspended at any time for a number of safety-related reasons. For example, we may voluntarily suspend or terminate such clinical trials if, at any time, we believe that defibrotide presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In addition, institutional review boards or regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, including if they present an unacceptable safety risk to patients. Administering any product candidate to humans may produce undesirable side effects. VOD is a condition associated with high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Adverse events involving vascular disorders, coagulation and potentially life-threatening bleeding have been reported in VOD patients treated with defibrotide, which could potentially be related to the defibrotide therapy. Hypotension has been reported in patients participating in clinical trials of defibrotide to treat severe VOD, which may also be related to the drug. Also, we discontinued a 69-patient Phase I/II clinical trial of defibrotide to prevent deep vein thrombosis after hip surgery in Denmark in 2002, when three patients experienced hypotension after receiving the defibrotide intravenously. That trial was discontinued due to the hypotension and because defibrotide can also be administered orally to prevent deep vein thrombosis. These adverse events reports will be assessed by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in determining whether defibrotide is, from a risk-benefit perspective, safe and effective to treat severe VOD, to prevent VOD, and to prevent deep vein thrombosis. It is possible that new adverse events or safety issues will emerge from future data, which could impact conclusions relating to the safety of defibrotide. Any complications associated with the use of defibrotide would severely harm our business operations. Product liability and other claims arising out of the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials may reduce demand for our products or result in substantial damages. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure in connection with human clinical trial testing of defibrotide and the distribution of defibrotide through our named-patient and cost recovery programs. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us if defibrotide causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. 8 Product liability claims of this nature may result in: · a decreased demand for defibrotide; · injury to our reputation; · withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers; · significant litigation costs; and · substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost. Our inability to obtain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of any products that we or our collaborators develop, including defibrotide. If we are successfully sued for any injury caused by our products or processes, then our liability could exceed our product liability insurance coverage and our total assets. Defibrotide could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, if and when defibrotide is approved. Any product for which we obtain marketing approval, together with the manufacturing processes, post-approval commitments, and advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with defibrotide or its manufacture, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in: · restrictions on defibrotide or manufacturing processes; · withdrawal of defibrotide from the market; · voluntary or mandatory recalls; · fines; · suspension of regulatory approvals; · product seizures; or · injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we may lose marketing approval for defibrotide when and if defibrotide is approved. Our manufacturing facility and the manufacturing facility of Patheon S.p.A., with whom we have contracted to fill and finish defibrotide, are subject to continuing regulation by Italian authorities and are subject to inspection and regulation by the FDA and the EMA. These authorities could force us to stop manufacturing our products if they determine that we or Patheon are not in compliance with applicable regulations or require us to complete further costly alterations to our facilities. We manufacture our APIs at our manufacturing facility in Italy. In addition, we have hired Patheon S.p.A. to process defibrotide into the finished drug at Patheon’s manufacturing facility. These facilities are subject to continuing regulation by the Italian Health Authority and other Italian regulatory authorities with respect to the manufacturing of APIs, including the defibrotide compound, and defibrotide. These facilities are also subject to inspection and regulation by the FDA and the EMA with respect to the manufacturing of the defibrotide API compound and defibrotide. Also, part of the process to obtain FDA and EMA approval for defibrotide is to obtain certification from those authorities that these facilities are in compliance with current good manufacturing practices. Following initial approval, if any, the FDA or the EMA will continue to inspect our manufacturing facilities, in some cases, unannounced, to confirm ongoing compliance with good manufacturing practices. These regulators may deny approval to manufacture our APIs or otherwise require us to stop manufacturing our APIs if they determine that either our facility or Patheon’s facility does not meet the standards of compliance required under applicable regulations. In addition, these regulators may require us to complete costly alterations to our facilities. 9 The Public Company Acounting Oversight Board is unable to enforce its review of the audits conducted by our independent registered public accounting firm operating in Italy; therefore, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Reconta Ernst and Young S.p.A., that issues the audit reports included in our annual reports filed with the SEC, is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, to assess its compliance with SEC rules and PCAOB professional standards. While our audits are performed in accordance with the standards of PCAOB, our auditors are a registered public accounting firm in Italy, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable, under Italian law, to enforce their inspection of our auditors audits and, therefore, our auditors, like other independent registered public accounting firms in Italy, are currently not inspected by the PCAOB. Inspections of audit firms that the PCAOB has conducted have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The lack of PCAOB inspections in Italy prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditor’s audits and quality control procedures. As a result, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in Italy may deprive investors of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. We currently rely upon a sole processor, Patheon S.p.A., to fill and finish defibrotide into marketable formulations, and we may not be able to quickly replace Patheon if it is unable to perform these services. If Patheon does not or is not able to perform these services for any reason, it may take time and resources to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to another processor, and such a delay could potentially cause us to breach contractual obligations into which we have entered or may enter, violate local laws requiring us to deliver the product to those in need, and impact our revenues. We use hazardous materials in our manufacturing facility, and any claims relating to the improper handling, storage, release or disposal of these materials could be time-consuming and expensive. Our manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients involves the controlled storage, use and disposal of chemicals and solvents. We are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, transportation, treatment, storage, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, wastewater discharges and air emissions. We obtained certification under the UNI EN ISO 14001 Standard for our environmental management system on April 20, 2007 and an Eco-management and Audit Scheme, or EMAS, certification on July 26, 2007. Both certifications were renewed in 2010 and we are currently working on obtaining renewals for the certifications for an additional three-year period following their expiration. Our environmental policy is designed to comply with current regulations on environmental protection, to provide for continuous improvement of our manufacturing performance, to protect our employees’ health, to protect the safety of people working at our location and to respect the safety of people living close to our plant and in the surrounding community. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from hazardous materials. If an accident occurs, an injured party could seek to hold us liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. We may incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. We may have difficulty obtaining raw material for defibrotide. Defibrotide is based on pig intestines. If our current sources of pig intestines encounter safety or other issues that impact their ability to supply the pig intestines to us as needed, we may not be able to find alternative suppliers in a timely fashion. In that case, we would have to slow or cease our manufacture of defibrotide. 10 Due to our limited resources, we rely on third parties for the development of defibrotide and, if these third parties fail to comply with strict regulations, the development of defibrotide may be delayed or unsuccessful. We do not have the personnel capacity to manage all aspects concerning the development of defibrotide. We depend on third-party providers to manage our clinical trials and will likely continue to depend on such third parties with respect to any future clinical trials conducted. If these third parties fail to comply with applicable regulations or if they fail to adequately execute such trials and/or manage or studies, we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements without undue delay or additional expenditures and, as a result, the development of defibrotide may be delayed or we may fail to gain regulatory approval altogether. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and key relationships, our business could be seriously harmed. We are highly dependent on our senior management, whose services are critical to the successful implementation of research and development and manufacturing and regulatory strategies, and our ability to maintain relationships with key opinion leaders. If we lose one or more of the members of our senior management or other key opinion leaders, our business could be seriously harmed. Replacing key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of specific skills and experience required to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize defibrotide. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these additional key personnel, if needed. We have sold Prociclide and Noravid (two formulations of defibrotide) in Italy to treat vascular disease with risk of thrombosis, which may affect the pricing of defibrotide in Europe for the prevention or treatment of VOD. Until December 31, 2008, through a distribution agreement with Crinos S.p.A., we sold Prociclide and Noravid (both forms of defibrotide) in Italy to treat vascular disease with risk of thrombosis. While we have stopped selling Prociclide and Noravid for this treatment in Italy, if defibrotide is approved for sale in Europe to treat and/or prevent VOD, we may need to obtain regulatory approval of the price we charge for these uses of defibrotide. The regulators may impose an artificially low cap on defibrotide based on the relatively low price-point of Prociclide and Noravid previously sold in Italy for the treatment of vascular disease with risk of thrombosis. All of our manufacturing capability is located in one facility that is vulnerable to natural disasters, telecommunication and information system failures, terrorism and similar problems, and we are not insured against losses that may be caused by any of these occurrences or events. We conduct all of our manufacturing operations in a single facility located in Villa Guardia, near Como, Italy. This facility could be damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunication and information system failure, terrorism or a similar event. Our insurance covers damages to the facility, including the buildings, machinery, electronic equipment and goods, of up to approximately €22 million, but does not cover damages caused by any of the events listed above, including terrorism and some types of flooding. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate for our current and proposed operations, there can be no guarantee that it will adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur. We are not insured against business interruption and we do not have a replacement manufacturing facility readily available. Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes. As a result, we may be unable to compete successfully or to develop innovative products, which could harm our business. Our industry is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Incidence of VOD may decrease with new technologies and conditioning regimens, which will negatively impact our sales opportunities. While we are unaware of any other products or product candidates that treat or prevent VOD, we believe that other companies may have products or are currently developing products to treat some of the same disorders and diseases that defibrotide is designed to treat. Many of these competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience, and greater manufacturing, marketing and financial resources than we have. In addition, these companies’ products and product candidates are in more advanced stages of development than our product candidates or have otherwise been approved for sale by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. As a result, these companies may be able to develop their product candidates and establish their products in the market before we can. Their products may also prove to be more effective, safer or less costly than defibrotide, which could hurt our ability to realize any significant revenues. In May 2003, the FDA designated defibrotide as an orphan drug to treat VOD, and in January 2007, the FDA designated defibrotide as an orphan drug to prevent VOD. If the FDA approves NDAs for these uses of defibrotide, before approving a NDA filed by anyone else, the orphan drug status will grant us limited market exclusivity for seven years from the date of the FDA’s approval of our NDA. However, a marketing authorization may be granted to another applicant for the same product if we give our consent to such authorization, if we are unable to supply sufficient quantities of defibrotide, or if the second applicant can establish in its application that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to our product. In that case, our product would not have market exclusivity. There is no guarantee that the FDA will approve our NDA, if and when we are ready to resubmit, before approving another company’s product for the same uses, although we are not aware of any other company that is researching defibrotide for these uses at this time. In such a case, however, the first product approved would have market exclusivity and our products would not be eligible for approval until that exclusivity period expires. 11 In July 2004, the EMA designated defibrotide as an orphan medicinal product to both treat and prevent VOD. If the European regulators do grant us a marketing authorization for those uses of defibrotide, we will have limited market exclusivity for those uses for ten years following the date of the approval. However, a marketing authorization may be granted to another applicant for the same product if we consent to such authorization, we are unable to supply sufficient quantities of defibrotide, or the second applicant can establish in its application that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to our product. In that case, our product would not have market exclusivity. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, our ability to compete could be impaired. Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to create and market competitive products and to protect those creations. Our pending patent applications, or those applications that we may file in the future, may not be granted. Until a patent is issued, the claims covered by the patent may be narrowed or removed entirely and, therefore, we may not obtain adequate patent protection. As a result, we may face unanticipated competition, or conclude that the risk of bringing products to the market is too great, thus adversely affecting our operating results. Because of the extensive time required to develop, test and complete a regulatory review of a product candidate, it is possible that our relevant patent rights may expire either before defibrotide can be approved for sale and commercialized or within a short time after commercialization. We have been issued a patent in the U.S. and several other countries which covers the method for determining the biological activity of defibrotide. The patent expires in 2022 in most countries. This patent is important because the analytical release of a biological product like defibrotide is a key step in confirming the purity and biological activity of the final product. There may not be an opportunity to extend this patent and thereby extend the exclusivity period related to the FDA and the EMA, in which case we could face increased competition for defibrotide. Patent expiration could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and, consequently, our operating results and financial position. In addition, generic innovators may be able to circumvent this patent and design a novel analytical method for determining the biological activity of defibrotide. In this case, a generic defibrotide could potentially be on the market once the relevant protections offered by our orphan designations end. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, particularly when patent protection is inappropriate or unattainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. To enforce a claim against a third party for illegally obtaining and using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. We intend to eventually license or sell our products in China, South Korea and other countries which do not afford intellectual property rights and protections to the extent that United States and Europe do. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Risks Related to Ownership of the American Depositary Shares Our ADSs have generally had low trading volume, and their public trading price has been volatile. The market price of our common stock has been highly volatile. Between our initial public offering on June 21, 2005 and December 31, 2012, the closing price of our ADSs has fluctuated between $0.33 and $24.40 per share, with an average daily trading volume for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2012 of approximately 21,724 ADSs. The market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations for many reasons, some of which may be unrelated to our operating performance. In addition to general market volatility, other factors that may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of our ADSs include: · public announcements of decisions made by regulators in both the United States and abroad; · public announcements of improvements, new commercial products, failures of products, or progress toward commercialization by our competitors or peers; · the influence of commercial partner and significant shareholder, Sigma-Tau Finanziaria S.p.A.; 12 · developments concerning proprietary rights, including patent and litigation matters; · publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to product candidates under development by us or by our competitors; · regulatory developments; and · quarterly fluctuation in our revenues and financial results. We may not remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. From the date of our public offering through May 2006, our ADSs were listed on the American Stock Exchange. Since May 2006, our ADSs have been listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. The Nasdaq Global Market sets forth various requirements that must be met in order for our ADSs to continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. We would be in violation of the continued listing requirements if: · the closing bid price of our ADSs drops below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive trading days; · our stockholders’ equity falls below $10 million; or · we fail to maintain a market value for publicly held securities of at least $5 million for 30 consecutive trading days. In the event of any such violation, our ADSs could be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. The delisting of our ADSs could have negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest, and fewer business development opportunities. As of December 31, 2012, our stockholders’ equity was $26.83 million (€20.35 million). If we fail to meet the stockholders’ equity or fail to meet the minimum bid price and minimum market value requirements, we may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. One of our largest shareholders and our founder exercises significant control over us, which may make it more difficult for you to elect or replace directors or management and approve or reject mergers and other important corporate events, including obtaining potential financing. One of our largest shareholders and our founder, F3F S.p.A. (formerly known as FinSirton S.p.A.) owned approximately 17% of our outstanding ordinary shares at December 31, 2012. Dr. Laura Ferro, our former Chief Executive Officer and President and a current member of our board of directors, together with members of her family, may be deemed to control F3F S.p.A. In addition, Sigma-Tau Finanziaria S.p.A., along with its affiliates, owned approximately 18% of our outstanding ordinary shares at December 31, 2011. Dr. Marco Brughera, who holds various senior-level positions within the Sigma-Tau Group, serves as a member of our Board of Directors. Moreover, we have licensed our rights in defibrotide to treat and prevent VOD to Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sigma-Tau Finanziaria. Both F3F S.p.A. and Sigma-Tau Finanziaria may substantially control the outcome of all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other important corporate events. They may exercise this ability in a manner that advances their best interests, and not necessarily your best interest. Also, the concentration of our beneficial ownership may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control, or may discourage bids for the ADSs or our ordinary shares at a premium over the market price of the ADSs. The significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of the ADSs due to investors’ perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. As discussed in our risk factor entitled “Our shareholders can prevent us from executing a financing by alleging that our board of directors acted with serious irregularities when approving such financing, because the terms of such financing could harm our company,” each of F3F S.p.A. and Sigma-Tau Finanziaria own a percentage of our ordinary shares sufficient to bring legal action against our board of directors and to possibly prevent us from completing an important corporate event, such as a financing. In addition, under Italian law, directors are not required to recuse themselves from participation in matters that present a conflict of interest. They are merely required to declare the conflict of interest that pertains to the matter. Accordingly, directors who are affiliated with our shareholders may be present for certain discussions that involve or impact the shareholders to which such directors are affiliated. If a significant number of ADSs are sold into the market, the market price of the ADSs could significantly decline, even if our business is doing well. Our outstanding ordinary shares, ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of warrants and ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of options are not subject to lock-up agreements. We have filed registration statements for the resale of most of our outstanding ordinary shares and related ADSs and all of our ordinary shares and related ADSs issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants and options. Such registration and the ultimate sale of the securities in the markets may adversely affect the market for the ADSs. 13 You do not have the ability to exercise your voting rights in the same manner as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting materials in time to instruct the depository to exercise your right to vote. Except as described in this annual report and in the deposit agreement for the ADSs with our depositary, The Bank of New York Mellon, holders of the ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares evidenced by the ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of the ADSs will only have the right to instruct the depositary, as the holders’ representative, to exercise these voting rights. In addition, you may not receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote, and it is possible that you, or persons who hold ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote. You may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result. We may from time to time offer to our existing shareholders the right to purchase our securities. Under our deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will not offer those rights to ADS holders unless both the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or exempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. In addition, we may not be able to take advantage of any exemptions from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, holders of our ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result. You may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs. Your ADSs represented by American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or, from time to time, when it deems expedient, in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or if we or the depositary deem it advisable to do so under any requirement of law, any government or governmental body, any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason. Risks Relating to Being an Italian Corporation The process of seeking to raise additional funds is cumbersome, subject to the verification of an Italian notary public in compliance with our bylaws and applicable law, and may require prior approval of our shareholders at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. We are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy. The principal laws and regulations that apply to our operations, those of Italy and the European Union, are different from those of the United States. With some exceptions, in order to issue new equity or debt securities convertible into equity, we must increase our authorized capital. In order to do so, our board of directors must meet and resolve to recommend that our shareholders approve an amendment to our bylaws increasing our capital. The holders of the majority of our outstanding shares must then approve that amendment at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting duly called. These meetings take time to call and it might be very difficult to get a majority of the holders of all outstanding shares to vote in favor of the proposed resolution. In addition, an Italian notary public must verify that the capital increase is in compliance with our bylaws and with applicable Italian law. Further, under Italian law, our existing shareholders and any holders of convertible securities have preemptive rights (except in specific cases) to acquire any such shares pro-rated on their percentage interest in our company, and on the same terms as approved for such capital increase. Alternatively, our shareholders can delegate the power to increase our capital to the board of directors, but the board’s right to exercise such power, if delegated, will expire after five years. If the board does not approve a capital increase by the end of those five years, our board and shareholders would need to meet again to re-delegate this authority. With respect to shareholders’ resolutions approving a capital increase, Italian law provides that in the absence of meeting minutes, or in the event of the impossibility or illegality of the resolution, any interested person may, for a period of 180 days following the filing of the shareholders’ resolution with the competent Register of Companies, challenge such resolution. If a shareholders’ meeting was not called to approve the capital increase, the relevant resolution should be considered invalid and, any interested person may challenge the capital increase for a period of 90 days following the approval of the consolidated financial statements referring to the year during which the shareholders’ resolution has been, also partially, executed. In addition, once our shareholders authorize a capital increase, all those authorized shares that have been subscribed need to be entirely paid-up before the shareholders may authorize a new capital increase. These restrictions could limit our ability to issue new equity or convertible debt securities on a timely basis. 14 Our shareholders can prevent us from executing a financing by alleging that our board of directors acted with serious irregularities when approving such financing, because the terms of such financing could harm our company. On August 12, 2008, Sigma-Tau Finanziaria S.p.A., together with one of its affiliates, filed a claim in the Court of Como claiming that the members of our board of directors and our board of statutory auditors acted with serious irregularities, in violation of their duties as directors, in approving a potential financing because such financing was potentially harmful to the company. On August 18, 2008, the Court of Como issued a temporary order preventing us from moving forward with the potential financing. While this claim was later dismissed for lack of damages, the claim did, nonetheless, prevent the directors from implementing the financing. Any shareholder or group of shareholders constituting at least 10% of our outstanding ordinary shares could bring a similar action on a future board resolution regarding a financing or other important corporate action, and an Italian court could prevent the transaction from moving forward by issuing an order to that effect. Italian law places restrictions on the amount of debt securities that we may issue relative to our equity to the extent that such debt securities are not listed on regulated markets or do not otherwise provide the holder of such securities the right to purchase or convert the same into our shares. Under Italian law, we may issue debt securities in an amount not to exceed twice the sum of our capital, our legal reserve and any other disposable reserves appearing on our latest Italian GAAP balance sheet approved by our shareholders, unless the debt securities are listed on regulated markets or provide the holder of such securities the right to purchase or convert the same into our shares, in which case such restrictions do not apply. The legal reserve is a reserve to which we allocate 5% of our Italian GAAP net income each year until it equals at least 20% of our capital. One of the other reserves that we maintain on our balance sheet is a “share premium reserve,” meaning amounts paid for our ordinary shares in excess of the amount of such ordinary shares that is allocated to the capital. At December 31, 2012, the sum of Gentium S.p.A. capital, legal reserves and other reserves on our unaudited Italian GAAP financial statements was €38.97 million. If, in the future, we issue debt securities that are not listed on regulated markets or do not provide the holder of the securities the right to purchase or convert the same into our shares, until such debt securities are repaid in full, we may not voluntarily reduce our capital or allocate our reserves (such as by declaring dividends) if it results in the aggregate of the capital and reserves being less than half of the outstanding amount of the debt. In such a case, if our equity is reduced by losses or otherwise such that the amount of the outstanding debt securities is more than twice the amount of our equity, some legal scholars are of the opinion that the ratio must be restored through a recapitalization of our company. If our equity is reduced, we could recapitalize by issuing new shares or having our shareholders contribute additional capital to us, although there can be no assurance that we would be able to find purchasers of new shares or that any of our current shareholders would be willing to contribute additional capital. If we suffer losses that reduce our capital to less than €120 thousand, we would need to recapitalize, change our form of entity or be liquidated. Italian law requires us to reduce our shareholders’ equity and, in particular, our capital, to reflect on-going losses, in certain cases of losses exceeding 1/3 of the capital of the Company. We are also required to maintain a minimum capital of €120 thousand. At December 31, 2012, our unaudited Gentium S.p.A. Italian GAAP capital was approximately €15.04 million. If we suffer losses from operations that reduce our capital to less than €120 thousand, then we must either increase our capital (which we could do by issuing new shares or having our shareholders contribute additional capital to our company) to at least €120 thousand or convert the form of our company into an S.r.l., which has a lower capital requirement of €10 thousand. If we do not take these steps, our company could be liquidated. We apply our operational losses against our legal reserves and capital. If our capital is reduced more than one-third as a result of losses, our board of directors must call a shareholders’ meeting as soon as possible. The shareholders should take appropriate measures, which may include, inter alia, reducing the legal reserves and capital by the amount of the remaining losses, or carrying the losses forward for up to one year. If the shareholders vote to carry the losses forward up to one year, and the losses are still more than one-third of the amount of the capital at the end of the year, then we must reduce our capital by the amount of the losses. Due to the differences between Italian and U.S. law, the depositary (acting as a shareholder on your behalf) may have fewer shareholder rights than you would have as a shareholder of a U.S. company. We are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy. As a result, the rights and obligations of our shareholders are governed by Italian law and our bylaws, and are in some ways different from those that apply to U.S. corporations. Some of these differences may result in the depositary (on your behalf) having fewer shareholder rights than you would have as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation. We have presented a detailed comparison of the Italian laws applicable to our company versus Delaware law in “Item 10, Additional Information, Comparison of Italian and Delaware Corporate Law.” We compare the Italian laws applicable to our company against Delaware law because Delaware is the most common state of incorporation for U.S. public companies. 15 Italian labor laws could impair our flexibility to restructure our business. In Italy, our employees are protected by various laws which afford them consultation rights with respect to specific matters regarding their employers’ business and operations, including the downsizing or closure of facilities and employee terminations. In particular: (i) Law no. 604/1966, regulates the individual dismissals; (ii) Law no. 223/1991, concerns the collective dismissal procedure; (iii) Law no. 428/1990 as amended by legislative decree no. 18/2001, provides for the information and consultation procedure in case of a transfer of the undertaking or a part thereof and (iv) Legislative decree no. 25/2007, introduces a general right to information and consultation for employees. These laws and the collective bargaining agreements to which we are subject could impair our flexibility if we need to restructure our business. 16 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This annual report may contain forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties regarding future events or our future performance, including the uncertainty as to whether regulatory approval for our lead product candidate, defibrotide, will be obtained.
