Item 1A. Risk Factors The following factors should be considered in evaluating our company and our business. These factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Risks Relating to Our Business Reduced prices and reimbursement rates for surgical procedures as a result of competition or Medicare and other governmental and private third party payor cost containment efforts could reduce our revenue, profitability and cash flow Government sponsored health care programs accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. The health care industry is continuing to experience a trend toward cost containment as government and private third-party payors seek to contain reimbursement and utilization rates and to negotiate reduced payment schedules with health care providers. These trends may result in a reduction from historical levels in per patient revenue received by our ASCs. Changes in Medicare payment rates have, in the past, resulted in reduced payments to ASCs. Medicaid and other governmental and private insurance payments also could be affected to the extent that these insurance companies use payment methodologies based on Medicare rates, or take actions independent of Medicare to revise payment methodologies. On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (referred to as the Medicare Modernization Act) was signed into law. The Medicare Modernization Act eliminates the historical practice of basing ASC facility fees on cost surveys of ASCs, and instead requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to devise a new methodology for establishing ASC facility payments, and to implement new reimbursement rates based on the new methodology between January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2008. On August 23, 2006, CMS proposed a new rate-setting methodology pursuant to the mandate established under the Medicare Modernization Act. Under the rate-setting methodology proposed by CMS, ASC facility payments would be a percentage (proposed to be 62 percent) of the rates paid to hospitals for the same services when furnished on an outpatient basis in the hospital setting. Payments for certain services commonly furnished in a physician offices would be capped at the amount Medicare pays physicians as a technical component when the services are furnished in the office setting. In the proposal, CMS also announced its intent to implement the new payment system effective for services furnished on and after January 1, 2008. When CMS eventually implements rebased rates, payment amounts for most procedures could change, in some cases significantly. Additionally, the Medicare Modernization Act provides that there shall be no inflation update to Medicare ASC rates during calendar years 2005 through 2009. This freeze will adversely affect the revenues of our business. Further, if CMS finalizes its proposal to base ASC payments on amounts paid to hospitals for comparable services, we anticipate significant fluctuation in ASC payment rates from year-to-year when CMS annually updates hospital payment rates. 15 The proposed rule, as written, would result in a reduction in the reimbursement rates for certain ophthalmology procedures, including cataract and YAG procedures, which made up approximately 54% of the procedures performed in our ASCs in the fourth quarter of 2006. The proposed rule also would reduce reimbursement rates for gastroenterology and pain procedures which together made up approximately 14% of the procedures performed in our ASCs in the fourth quarter of 2006. Conversely, the proposed rule would increase reimbursement rates for certain procedures, including orthopedic procedures, which made up approximately 8% of the total procedures performed in our ASCs in the fourth quarter of 2006. These proposed reimbursement changes are currently scheduled to be phased in over a two-year period beginning January 1, 2008. If we annualized our fourth quarter 2006 procedure mix, payor mix and volume, we estimate that the first phase of the proposed rule would negatively impact our annual earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.02. We estimate that the final phase of the proposed rule, including the impact of the first phase, would negatively impact our annual earnings per share by $0.03 to $0.04. On February 8, 2006, the President signed into law the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. This legislation requires CMS to, among other things, limit Medicare reimbursements for surgical procedures furnished in ASCs to the amount paid to a hospital for the same service effective for services furnished on and after January 1, 2007. CMS implemented this change effective January 1, 2007. Since Medicare previously paid ASCs more than hospitals for certain procedures commonly furnished in our facilities, this change reduced reimbursement for certain services furnished in our facilities and negatively impacted our business. Considering the procedures performed in our ASCs in 2006 and prior years, the most significant impact to us from this legislation is the reduction in the Medicare facility fee for the after-cataract laser surgery procedure which is also known as the YAG procedure. Based on the number of YAG procedures performed in our ASCs during the fourth quarter of 2006, we estimate that the annual impact from the decreased Medicare facility fee paid for these procedures is a reduction of approximately $1.2 million to $1.4 million in net surgical facilities revenue. This would equate to an estimated negative impact in earnings per share of between $0.01 and $0.02. To the extent that other payors, governmental and private, adopt this practice, the impact could be greater. Under current regulations, ASC Covered Procedures, i.e., those for which a facility fee is provided by the Medicare program, are those procedures specifically approved by CMS. CMS develops and maintains a listing of ASC Covered Procedures (defined by HCPCS Code). A facility fee is available only for listed procedure codes. At present, approximately 2,500 procedures are approved for the ASC setting. CMS is required by law to update the list of ASC Covered Procedures every two (2) years. CMS has disregarded this requirement for many years. There is a substantial risk that CMS will occasionally disregard this statutory requirement, and not update the list of ASC Covered Procedures as required by law. There also is a material risk that CMS will reduce the number of ASC Covered Procedures. On November 26, 2004, CMS proposed to delete 100 procedures from the list of ASC Covered Procedures, including many procedures that are commonly furnished in ASC settings. Although CMS ultimately decided in May 2005 to delete only five of the proposed 100 procedures, CMS could again propose and ultimately decide to substantially reduce the number of procedures for which Medicare will pay an ASC facility fee, a change that could affect the financial viability of our business. To the extent that any procedures performed at our ASCs are deleted from the list of ASC Covered Procedures, it could negatively and materially affect our revenue and business. 16 Considerable uncertainty surrounds the future determination of Medicare reimbursement levels for ambulatory surgical services. Services reimbursable under the Medicare program are subject to legislative change, administrative rulings, interpretations, discretion, governmental funding restrictions and requirements for utilization review. Such matters, as well as more general governmental budgetary concerns, may significantly reduce payments made to ASCs under this program, and there can be no assurance that future Medicare payment rates will be sufficient to cover the costs of, or cost increases in, providing services to Medicare patients. Revenue from laser vision correction procedures comprised approximately 3% of our surgical facilities net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. The market for providing laser vision correction and other refractive surgery procedures continues to be highly competitive. In response, many of our competitors are offering laser vision correction or other refractive surgery services at lower prices than the prices we charge. If price competition continues, however, we may choose or be forced to lower the facility fees we charge in our surgical facilities. If we lower our fees, we could experience reductions in our revenue, profitability and cash flow. As we develop and acquire more multi-specialty ASCs, we anticipate that the percentage of our surgical facilities net revenue derived from governmental payors such as Medicare will decrease while reimbursements from private third party payors will increase. Given this changing payor mix, our success will depend on our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private third party payors. Even though our relative dependence on Medicare reimbursements may decrease, our revenue from private third party payors could be negatively affected by any adverse Medicare changes because many private third party payors tie their reimbursement levels to Medicare rates. Our failure to operate, acquire or develop a sufficient number of profitable surgical facilities could limit our profitability and revenue growth Our growth strategy is focused on growing our existing ASCs and acquiring or developing new ASCs in a cost-effective manner. We may not experience an increase in surgical procedures at our existing or future ASCs. We may not be able to achieve the economies of scale and patient base, or provide the business, administrative and financial services required to grow or sustain profitability in our existing and future ASCs. Newly acquired or developed facilities may generate losses or experience lower operating margins than our more established facilities, or they may not generate returns that justify our investment. The current market for ASC acquisitions is very competitive, and most potential targets are evaluating offers from multiple bidders. This bidding process often results in increased purchase prices and less favorable transaction terms. In many instances, we have dropped out of the bidding because we thought the price was too high or other proposed terms were unacceptable. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or development targets, successfully negotiate the acquisition or development of these facilities on satisfactory terms, or have the access to adequate capital to finance these endeavors. We anticipate that we will fund the acquisition and development of future ASCs from cash generated from our operations and amounts borrowed under our credit facility. The maximum commitment available under our credit facility is currently $125 million. Our current credit facility expires on February 5, 2010. As of February 28, 2007, we have approximately $58 million of availability under our credit facility. Given that we intend to continue to finance our acquisitions by using a combination of cash generated from our business operations and borrowings under our credit facility, we may in the future need to increase our maximum available commitment. We have an option under our credit facility to increase the maximum commitment to $150 million under certain conditions. To the extent we are able to increase our maximum commitment, if at all, such an increase may not be on terms that are favorable to us or sufficient for our needs. Our maximum borrowing availability and applicable interest rates under our credit facility are calculated based on a ratio of our total indebtedness to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), all as more fully defined in our credit facility. Our credit facility currently provides for temporary increases in this ratio through September 30, 2008 for purposes of calculating our maximum borrowing availability. This ratio will decrease following September 30, 2008 and will reduce our maximum borrowing capacity. In addition, our higher level of borrowings and the continued periodic escalation in interest rates have increased our borrowing costs which have adversely affected our profitability. 17 If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy or manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our revenue and profitability could decrease if we are unable to maintain positive relationships with the physicians who perform surgical procedures at our ASCs The success of our business depends on our relationship with, and the success and efforts of, the physicians who perform surgical procedures at our ASCs. Our physician partners may perform surgical procedures at other facilities or hospitals, are not required to use our ASCs and may choose not to perform procedures at our ASCs. Our revenue and profitability would decline if our relationship with key physicians deteriorated or those physicians reduced or eliminated their use of our ASCs. In addition, our business and reputation could be damaged if the physicians who use our ASCs fail to provide quality medical care or follow required professional guidelines at our facilities. In addition, co-owning ASCs with physicians may create additional regulatory risk. See Government Regulation  Federal Law  Anti-Kickback Statute. Our indebtedness could limit our flexibility As we borrow to fund acquisitions we may become significantly leveraged in the future. Our acquisition and development program requires substantial capital resources and the operations of our existing ASCs also require ongoing capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including the timing and size of our acquisitions, development and expansion activities, capital requirements associated with our ASCs, and the future cost of medical equipment. As of February 28, 2007, we have approximately $58 million of availability under our credit facility. If we identify favorable acquisition and development opportunities that require additional resources, we may be required to incur additional indebtedness in order to pursue these opportunities. We may be unable to obtain sufficient financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. As a result, our acquisition and development activities would have to be curtailed or eliminated and our financial results would be adversely affected. The degree to which we are leveraged could also cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, reducing the funds available for our operations. As our indebtedness increases, the portion of our borrowings at variable interest rates will also likely increase which will leave us vulnerable to interest rate increases. Our degree of leverage may also make us vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally and, to the extent we become more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, place us at a competitive disadvantage. Our increased indebtedness and higher borrowing costs may require us to seek additional equity financing. To the extent any such equity financing is available to us, it may be dilutive to our current equity holders. Our operating margins and profitability could suffer if we are unable to manage effectively, and grow the revenue of, our increasing number of ASCs Our growth strategy includes increasing our revenue and earnings by increasing the number of procedures performed at our ASCs. Because we do not anticipate price increases from third party payors, our operating margins will be adversely affected if we do not increase the revenue and procedure volume of our existing ASCs to offset increases in our operating costs. We seek to increase procedure volume and revenue at our ASCs by increasing the number of physicians performing procedures at our facilities, obtaining new or more favorable managed care contracts, improving patient flow at our centers and achieving operating efficiencies. We may not be successful in these endeavors. 18 We acquired ten ASCs in 2006 and our business strategy contemplates us continuing to acquire and develop more ASCs in the future. Our growth has placed, and will continue to place, increased demands on our employees, business systems and other resources. Continued expansion of our operations will require substantial financial resources and management attention. To accommodate our past and anticipated future growth, we will need to continue to implement and improve the management and operation of our business systems and to expand, train, manage and motivate our employees. Our operating results could suffer if we dont properly manage our growth. We may not compete effectively with other companies that have greater resources and experience than us or that may have the ability to influence our licensure Competitors with substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources and experience may compete more effectively than us. We compete with other businesses, including ASC companies, hospitals, individual physicians, other ASCs, laser vision correction centers, eye care clinics and providers of retail optical products. Competitors with substantially greater resources may be more successful in acquiring and developing surgical facilities. Hospitals and other ASCs may be more successful in attracting physicians to utilize their facilities. Our optical laboratories and optical products purchasing organization also face competition on national, regional and local levels. Companies in other health care industry segments, including managers of hospital-based medical specialties or large group medical practices, may become competitors in providing ASCs and surgical equipment, as well as competitive eye care related services. Competition for retaining the services of highly qualified medical, technical and managerial personnel is significant. We also face competitive pressures from local hospitals. In addition to competing for patients and physician relationships, ASCs are often required by Medicare and certain state laws to maintain a written transfer agreement with an area hospital. A transfer agreement provides that a hospital will accept an ASCs patient in the event of an emergency. Generally, we have not encountered problems obtaining transfer agreements from area hospitals. In limited instances, however, we have observed hospitals resisting entering into transfer agreements for what we believe to be competitive reasons. While there often are alternatives for ASCs to comply with federal and state regulations without a transfer agreement, competitive pressures from hospitals may make it more difficult and/or expensive for our ASCs to maintain their licensure and/or Medicare certification. Changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, or adoption of new laws or regulations, governing our business operations, including physician use and/or ownership of ASCs, could result in penalties to us, require us to incur significant expenditures, or force us to make changes to our business operations 19 We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision under federal, state and local laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations, and courts and regulatory authorities generally have provided limited clarification. Moreover, state and local laws and interpretations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. As a result, we may not always be able to accurately predict interpretations of applicable law, and federal and state authorities could challenge some of our activities, including our co-ownership of ASCs with physicians and other investors. If any of our activities are challenged, we may have to divert substantial time, attention and resources from running our business to defend our activities against these challenges, regardless of their merit. If we do not successfully defend these challenges, we may face a variety of adverse consequences, including: loss of use of our ASCs; losing our eligibility to participate in Medicare or Medicaid or losing other contracting privileges; or in some instances, civil or criminal fines or penalties. Any of these results could impair our sources of revenue and our profitability and limit our ability to grow our business. For example, the federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation, receipt, offer or payment of any direct or indirect remuneration in return for the referral of patients or the ordering or purchasing of items or services payable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. This statute is very broad and Congress directed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop regulatory exceptions, known as safe harbors, to the statutes referral prohibitions. While we have attempted to structure the ownership and operation of our ASCs within a safe harbor, we do not satisfy all of the requirements. Because there is no legal requirement that relationships fit within a safe harbor, a business arrangement that does not comply with the safe harbor, or for which a safe harbor does not exist, does not necessarily violate the anti-kickback statute. Presently, despite the fact that we do not fit within a safe harbor, we believe that our ownership and operation of ASCs complies with the anti-kickback statute. However, existing interpretations or enforcement of the federal anti-kickback statute or other applicable federal or state laws and regulations could change. If so, violations of the anti-kickback statute or other laws may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded programs. In addition, there also is a material risk that Congress, CMS or the states could revise physician ownership and referral laws in a manner that could prohibit or limit physician ownership of ASCs. In December 2003, Congress enacted legislation imposing an 18-month moratorium on physician referrals to certain categories of hospitals, i.e., those classified as specialty hospitals under the law, if the physician has an ownership interest in the entity. This moratorium expired in June 2005. Future actions by either Congress or CMS to extend or possibly expand the scope of the moratorium potentially could prohibit or limit physician ownership of ASCs. Additionally, several states are considering limits on physician ownership in and referrals to specialty hospitals, and a few are considering similar limitations on physician ownership in and referrals to ASCs. To the extent that Congress, CMS or any of the states act to prohibit or limit physician ownership of ASCs, the investment structure of our ASCs could be affected. Our limited liability company agreements and limited partnership agreements pursuant to which we own our ASCs provide that if certain laws and regulations change, or the interpretation and/or enforcement of such laws and regulations change, we may have to purchase some or all of the equity interests in our ASCs owned by physicians. The regulatory changes that could trigger this repurchase include it becoming: (i) illegal for a physician to own an equity interest in one of our ASCs; (ii) illegal for physician-owners in our ASCs to refer Medicare or other patients to the facility; or (iii) substantially likely that the receipt by physician-owners of cash distributions from the limited liability company or partnership will be illegal. The cost of repurchasing these equity interests would be substantial. We may not have sufficient capital resources to fund these obligations, and it may trigger the need to procure additional debt or equity financing. To the extent any such financing was available to us, it may be on terms that reduce our earnings or are dilutive to our current equity holders. While we attempt to structure these purchase obligations as favorable as possible to us, the triggering of these obligations could have a significantly negative effect on our financial condition and business prospects. 20 Furthermore, CMS may revise the Medicare conditions for coverage of ASC services. Our Medicare-certified ASCs are required to comply with a series of regulatory obligations in order to qualify services furnished in those facilities for Medicare reimbursement. CMS has not revised the Medicare regulatory conditions for coverage in many years, but has in recent years indicated its intent to update these requirements through notice and comment rulemaking. It is our expectation that our facilities and operations could be modified as necessary to comply with whatever new conditions might be established. However, bringing our facilities and operations into compliance could involve substantial costs to the company. Moreover, it is possible that our facilities and operations could not be revised sufficiently to be in compliance with new Medicare conditions, in which case some or all of our ASCs may be forced to disenroll from the Medicare program. Many governmental and private payors require Medicare certification as a condition to participate in their payment plans. Any ASC not enrolled in Medicare may likewise be precluded from enrolling in other governmental and private payor plans. Such exclusion would have a material negative effect on our business. Regulation of the construction, acquisition or expansion of ASCs could prevent us from developing, acquiring, expanding or relocating facilities Most states require licenses to own and operate ASCs, and some states require a certificate of need, or CON, to construct or modify an ASC. Several states recently have been revising licensure and CON laws in a manner that makes it more difficult to develop or relocate ASCs. If we are unable to procure the appropriate state licensure approvals, or if we are unable to obtain a CON in states with CON laws, then we may not be able to acquire or construct a sufficient number of ASCs, or to expand the scope of services offered in our existing ASCs, to achieve our growth strategy. Procuring these approvals could take considerable time, effort and expense, and may result in delays in opening new or modified facilities. Moreover, if we are unable to maintain good relations with the landlords of our ASCs, we may be forced to relocate a facility from time to time. If we are forced to relocate a facility, we may incur substantial costs in building out and furnishing our new location. In addition, depending on the state, we may also have difficulty obtaining the necessary state licensure and CON approvals to relocate the facility. See Government Regulation  State Law. The nature of being actively involved in acquiring ASCs could subject us to potential claims and material liabilities relating to these businesses Although we conduct extensive due diligence prior to acquiring an ASC and are generally indemnified by the sellers, our acquisitions could subject us to claims, suits or liabilities relating to unknown or contingent liabilities or from incidents occurring prior to our acquisition of the facility. If we incur these liabilities and are not indemnified or insured for them, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Rapid technological advances may reduce our sources of revenue and our profitability Adoption of new technologies that may be comparable or superior to existing technologies for surgical equipment could reduce the amount of the facility fees we receive from physicians who use our surgical facilities, or the amount of revenue derived from our laser services agreements. Reduction of these sources of revenue could decrease our profitability. We also may have to expend significant capital resources to deploy new technology and related equipment to remain competitive. Our inability to provide access to new and improving technology could deter physicians from using our surgical facilities or equipment. 21 Loss of the services of key management personnel could adversely affect our business Our success depends, in part, on the services of key management personnel, including Thomas S. Hall our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; Jack M. Clark, our Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer; and Scott T. Macomber, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We do not know of any reason why we might be likely to lose the services of any of these officers. However, in light of the role that each of these officers is expected to play in our future growth, if we lost the services of any of these officers, we believe that our business could be adversely affected. The nature of our business could subject us to potential malpractice, product liability and other claims The provision of surgical services entails the potentially significant risk of physical injury to patients and an inherent risk of potential malpractice, product liability and other similar claims. Our insurance may not be adequate to satisfy claims or protect us and this coverage may not continue to be available at acceptable costs. A partially or completely uninsured claim against us could reduce our earnings and working capital. Our insurance policies are generally renewed on an annual basis. Although we believe we will be able to renew our current policies or otherwise obtain comparable professional liability coverage, we have no control over the potential costs to renew. Increases in professional liability and other insurance premiums will negatively affect our profitability. If a change in events or circumstances causes us to write-off a portion of our intangible assets, our total assets could be reduced significantly and we could incur a substantial charge to earnings Intangible assets, primarily in the form of goodwill, represent a significant portion of our total assets. At December 31, 2006, intangible assets of our continuing operations represented approximately 75% of total assets and 176% of stockholders' equity. The intangible asset value represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions and affiliations. The value of these assets may not be realized. We regularly, and at least annually, evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate all or a portion of the carrying amount of the asset may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings may become necessary. If, in the future, we determine that our intangible assets have suffered an impairment that requires us to write off a portion of the asset due to a change in events or circumstances, this write-off could significantly reduce our total assets and we could incur a substantial charge to earnings, as well as be in default under one or more covenants in our credit facility. Becoming and remaining compliant with federal regulations enacted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act could require us to expend significant resources and capital, and could impair our profitability and limit our ability to grow our business Numerous federal regulations have been adopted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Compliance with HIPAA regulations governing patient privacy was required by April 14, 2003. We have taken actions in an effort to establish our compliance with HIPAAs privacy regulations, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with HIPAAs privacy regulations. These actions include having our ASCs and affiliated providers implement new HIPAA-compliant policies and procedures, conducting employee HIPAA training, identifying business associates with whom we need to enter into HIPAA-compliant contractual arrangements and various other measures. Ongoing implementation and oversight of these measures involves significant time, effort and expense. 22 Other federal regulations adopted under HIPAA require that our affiliated providers and us be capable of conducting certain standardized health care transactions, including billing and other claims transactions. We have undertaken significant efforts, involving substantial time and expense, to assure that our ASCs and affiliated providers can submit transactions in compliance with HIPAA. We anticipate that continuing time and expense will be required to maintain the ability to submit HIPAA-compliant transactions, and to make sure that newly-acquired ASCs can submit HIPAA-compliant transactions. In addition, compliance with the HIPAA security regulations was required by April 21, 2005. In general, the security regulations require ASCs and other covered entities to implement reasonable technical, physical and administrative security measures to safeguard protected health information maintained, used and disclosed in electronic form. We have taken actions in an effort to establish our compliance with HIPAAs security regulations, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with HIPAAs security regulations. Ongoing implementation and oversight of these measures involves significant time, effort and expense. HIPAA violations could expose us to civil penalties of up to $25,000 per person per year for each violation or criminal penalties with fines of up to $250,000 and/or up to 10 years in prison per violation. Risks Relating to our Common Stock Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may make it difficult to predict our future results of operations and may cause volatility in our stock price During 2006, the market price of our common stock was volatile, fluctuating from a high trading price of $8.74 to a low trading price of $6.08 per share. Our results of operations have varied and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have a high level of fixed operating costs, including compensation costs and rent. As a result, our profitability depends to a large degree on the volume of surgical procedures performed in, and on our ability to utilize the capacity of, our surgical facilities. The timing and degree of fluctuations in our operating results will depend on several factors, including: general economic conditions; decreases in demand for non-emergency procedures due to severe weather; availability or sudden loss of the services of physicians who utilize our surgical facilities; availability or shortages of surgery-related products and equipment; the timing and relative size of acquisitions;and the recording of gains or losses on the sale of minority interests in our ASCs. These kinds of fluctuations in quarterly operating results may make it difficult for you to assess our future results of operations and may cause a decline or volatility in our stock price. Any return on your investment in our stock will depend on your ability to sell our stock at a profit We have never declared or paid any dividends and our credit agreement prohibits payment of dividends on our common stock. We anticipate that we will not declare dividends at any time in the foreseeable future. Instead we will retain earnings for use in our business. As a result, your return on an investment in our stock likely will depend on your ability to sell our stock at a profit. In addition, the stock market has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 23 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
