risk factors and unanticipated events. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from management's expectations. General First South Bancorp, Inc. First South Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Virginia corporation, incorporated on January 7, 1999, that serves as the holding company for First South Bank, a North Carolina chartered commercial bank (the “Bank”). The Company’s principal business is overseeing the business of the Bank and operating through the Bank a commercial banking business. The Bank has one significant operating segment, the providing of general commercial banking services to its markets located in the state of North Carolina. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “FSBK”. First South Bank. The Bank is a North Carolina chartered commercial bank headquartered in Washington, North Carolina. The Bank received federal insurance of its deposits in 1959. The Bank’s principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing these funds in commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, consumer loans and loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, single-family residences in the Bank’s market area. The Bank’s income consists principally of interest and fees earned on loans and investments, loan servicing and other fees, gains on the sale of loans and investments, and service charges and fees collected on deposit accounts. The Bank’s principal expenses are interest expense on deposits and borrowings and noninterest expense such as compensation and employee benefits, office occupancy expenses, FDIC insurance premiums, and other miscellaneous expenses. Funds for these activities are provided principally by deposits, borrowings, repayments of outstanding loans and investments and operating revenues. Market Area The Company makes loans and obtains deposits throughout eastern, northeastern, southeastern and central North Carolina, where the Bank’s offices are located. As of December 31, 2009, management estimates that more than 95% of deposits and 90% of loans came from its primary market area. The economy of the Company’s primary market area is diversified, with employment distributed among manufacturing, agriculture and non-manufacturing activities. There are a significant number of major employers in the Company’s primary market area. The unemployment rate in the Company’s market area is comparable to the national average and the unemployment rate for the State of North Carolina. Critical Accounting Policies The Company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company’s business operations is discussed throughout Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto, where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. 1 Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Loan Impairment and Allowance for Credit Losses. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. Uncollateralized loans are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate, while all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. The Bank uses several factors in determining if a loan or lease is impaired. The internal asset classification procedures include a thorough review of significant loans, leases and lending relationships and include the accumulation of related data. This data includes loan and lease payment status, borrowers’ financial data and borrowers’ operating factors such as cash flows, operating income or loss, etc. The allowance for credit losses is increased by charges to income and decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries). Management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on the Bank’s past loan and lease loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, and current economic conditions. While management believes that it has established the allowance for credit losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment, there can be no assurance in the future that regulators or risks in its loan and lease portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments will not require adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. Income Taxes. Deferred tax asset and liability balances are determined by application to temporary differences of the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes will become payable or receivable. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Off-Balance Sheet Risk. The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Lending Activities General. The Company’s gross loan portfolio, including real estate construction loans in process, totaled $692.0 million at December 31, 2009, representing 83.4% of total assets at that date. It is the Company’s policy to concentrate its lending within its market area. The Company originates a significant amount of commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2009, commercial real estate and construction loans amounted to $510.9 million, or 73.8% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio. The Company has no direct sub-prime or Alt-A loan exposure in its loan portfolio. In recent years, the Company has sought to increase originations of commercial business loans and consumer loans. At December 31, 2009, commercial business loans totaled $26.1 million, or 3.8% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio, and consumer loans totaled $90.7 million, or 13.1% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio. To a lesser extent, the Company also originates multi-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2009, $50.7 million, or 7.4% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio, consisted of single-family, residential mortgage loans. The Company’s residential mortgage construction loans totaled $3.0 million, or 0.4% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio, at December 31, 2009. 2 Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth selected data relating to the composition of the Company’s loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of gross loans other than as disclosed below.

The following table sets forth selected data relating to the composition of the Company’s unfunded commitments by type of loan at the date indicated.

The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2009 regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Company’s portfolio based on their maturity and repricing terms, including scheduled repayments of principal. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments which significantly shorten the average life of mortgage loans and may cause the Company’s repayment experience to differ from that shown below. Loan balances are net of construction loans in process. Lease balances are included in other loans. Due One Year or Less Due After 1 Through 5 Years After December 31, 2009 Due After 5 or More Years After December 31, 2009 Total (In thousands) Residential real estate loans $ 30,415 $ 65,401 $ 51,969 $ 147,785 Commercial real estate, business and other loans 208,293 252,770 64,756 525,819 Total $ 238,708 $ 318,171 $ 116,725 $ 673,604 The following table sets forth at December 31, 2009 the dollar amount of all loans due one year or more after December 31, 2009 which have predetermined interest rates and have floating or adjustable interest rates. Predetermined Rates Floating or Adjustable Rates (In thousands) Residential real estate loans $ 84,241 $ 33,130 Commercial real estate, business and other loans 232,308 85,217 Total $ 316,549 $ 118,347 4 Scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets. The average life of loans can be substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses on loans generally give the Bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgage loans. Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans. The Bank generally has authority to originate and purchase loans secured by real estate located throughout the state of North Carolina and the United States. Consistent with its emphasis on being a community-oriented financial institution, the Bank concentrates its lending activities in its market area. The Bank has not participated in sub-prime lending activities. The Bank’s loan originations are derived from a number of sources, including referrals from depositors and borrowers, repeat customers, advertising, calling officers as well as walk-in customers. The Bank’s solicitation programs consist of advertisements in local media, in addition to participation in various community organizations and events. Real estate loans are originated by the Bank’s loan personnel. The Bank’s loan personnel consists of both salaried with an annual incentive and commission paid mortgage loan officers. Loan applications are accepted at the Bank’s offices. Historically, the Bank generally has not purchased loans. However, the Bank may in the future consider making limited loan purchases, including purchases of commercial loans. In recent years, the Bank has sold or exchanged for mortgage-backed securities a significant amount of fixed-rate, single-family mortgage loans that it originated. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, these transactions totaled $109.8 million, $41.1 million and $42.2 million, respectively. Such loans are sold to or exchanged with the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”, also known as “Freddie Mac”). The Bank generally retains servicing on loans sold or exchanged to FHLMC. Loan Underwriting Policies. The Bank’s lending activities are subject to the Bank’s written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards, its outside investors and to loan origination procedures prescribed by the Bank’s Board of Directors and its management. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower’s ability to repay, and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial information and confirmations. The Bank uses an automated underwriting software program owned by FHLMC named Loan Prospector on the majority of loans underwritten for sale to FHLMC. In addition, loans sold to other investors may be manually underwritten by the Bank or the respective investor, or the respective investor’s representatives, or through an investor’s automated underwriting system, if applicable. All large loans are presented weekly by the management loan committee to a loan committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank, made up of three outside directors who serve on a rotating basis. The President does not serve on the loan committee of the Board of Directors. Individual officers of the Bank have been granted authority by the Board of Directors to approve consumer and commercial loans up to varying specified dollar amounts, depending upon the type of loan and the lender’s level of expertise. In addition, committees of loan officers have loan authorities greater than individual authorities. These authorities are based on aggregate borrowings of an individual or entity. Any loans to a single borrower over $1,500,000 must be approved by the Loan Committee. On a monthly basis, the full Board of Directors reviews the actions taken by the loan committee. Applications for single-family residential mortgage loans are underwritten and closed in accordance with the standards of FHLMC or the investor’s guidelines. Generally, after receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower, in compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, a credit report and verifications are ordered, or obtained, to verify specific information relating to the loan applicant’s employment, income and credit standing. If a proposed loan is to be secured by a mortgage on real estate, an appraisal of the real estate is usually undertaken either by an appraiser approved by the Bank and licensed by the State of North Carolina or an evaluation by qualified Bank personnel. In the case of single-family residential mortgage loans, except when the Bank becomes aware of a particular risk of environmental contamination, the Bank generally does not obtain a formal environmental report on the real estate at the time a loan is made. A formal environmental report may be required in connection with nonresidential real estate loans. It is the Bank’s policy to record a lien on the real estate securing a loan and to obtain title insurance which insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances and other possible title defects. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and, when the property is in a flood plain as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”), obtain flood insurance. 5 The Bank makes a loan commitment on single-family residential mortgage loans of between 15 and 90 days for each loan approved. If the borrower desires a longer commitment, the commitment may be extended for good cause and upon written approval. Fees of between $175 and $650 are charged in connection with the issuance of a commitment letter. The interest rate is guaranteed for the commitment period. If the amount of a residential loan originated or refinanced exceeds 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or contract price, the Bank’s policy generally is to obtain private mortgage insurance at the borrower’s expense on that portion of the principal amount of the loan that exceeds 80%. The Bank will make a single-family residential mortgage loan with up to a 95% loan-to-value ratio if the required private mortgage insurance is obtained. The Bank generally limits the loan-to-value ratio on commercial real estate mortgage loans to 85%, although the loan-to-value ratio on commercial real estate loans in limited circumstances has been as high as 100%. The Bank generally limits the loan-to-value ratio on multi-family residential real estate loans to 85%, although in limited circumstances the loan-to-value ratio has been higher. The Bank is subject to regulations that limit the amount the Bank can lend to one borrower. See “— Depository Institution Regulation — Limits on Loans to One Borrower.” Under these limits, the Bank’s loans-to-one-borrower were limited to $14.1 million at December 31, 2009. At that date, the Bank had no lending relationships in excess of the loans-to-one-borrower limit. Interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected principally by competitive factors, the demand for such loans and the supply of funds available for lending purposes. These factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative tax policies and government budgetary matters. Single-Family Residential Real Estate Lending. The Bank is an originator of single-family, residential real estate loans in its market area. At December 31, 2009, single-family, residential mortgage loans, excluding home improvement loans, totaled $50.7 million, or 7.4% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio. The Bank originates fixed-rate mortgage loans at competitive interest rates. At December 31, 2009, $32.5 million, or 59.6%, of the Company’s residential mortgage loan portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. Generally, the Company retains fixed-rate mortgages with maturities of 15 years or less while fixed-rate loans with longer maturities may be retained in portfolio or sold in the secondary market. The Bank also offers conventional and government mortgage loans in its market area, which are underwritten, closed and sold to an outside investor. The Bank also offers adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. The adjustable-rate loans currently offered by the Bank have interest rates which adjust every one, three, five, seven, or ten years from the closing date of the loan or on an annual basis commencing after an initial fixed-rate period of one, three, five, seven or ten years in accordance with a designated index plus a stipulated margin. The primary index utilized by the Bank is the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant comparable maturity equal to the loan adjustment period, as made available by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Treasury Rate”). The Bank offers adjustable-rate loans that meet FHLMC underwriting standards, as well as loans that do not meet such standards. The Bank’s adjustable-rate single-family residential real estate loans that do not meet FHLMC standards have a cap of generally 2% on any increase in the interest rate at any adjustment date, and include a cap on the maximum interest rate over the life of the loan, which cap generally is 3% to 6% above the initial rate. In return for providing a relatively low cap on interest rate increases over the life of the loan, the Bank’s adjustable-rate loans provide for a floor on the minimum interest rate over the life of the loan, which floor generally is the initial rate. Further, the Bank generally does not offer “teaser” rates, i.e., initial rates below the fully indexed rate, on such loans. The adjustable-rate mortgage loans offered by the Bank that do conform to FHLMC standards have a cap of up to 6% above the initial rate over the life of a loan and include a floor. All of the Bank’s adjustable-rate loans require that any payment adjustment resulting from a change in the interest rate of an adjustable-rate loan be sufficient to result in full amortization of the loan by the end of the loan term and, thus, do not permit any of the increased payment to be added to the principal amount of the loan, or so-called negative amortization. At December 31, 2009, $22.0 million, or 40.4%, of the Company’s residential mortgage loans were adjustable-rate loans. The retention of adjustable-rate loans in the Company’s portfolio helps reduce the Company’s exposure to increases or decreases in prevailing market interest rates. However, there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward repricing of adjustable-rate loans. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable-rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers. Further, although adjustable-rate loans allow the Company to increase the sensitivity of its interest-earning assets to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the initial fixed-rate period before the first adjustment and the lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that yields on the Company’s adjustable-rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the Company’s cost of funds. 6 Construction Lending. The Bank also offers residential and commercial construction loans, with a substantial portion of such loans originated to date being for the construction of single-family dwellings in the Bank’s primary market area. Residential construction loans are offered primarily to individuals building their primary, investment or secondary residence, as well as to selected local developers to build single-family dwellings. Generally, loans to owner/occupants for the construction of owner-occupied, single-family residential properties are originated in connection with the permanent loan on the property and have a construction term of 6 to 18 months. Such loans are offered on a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate basis. Interest rates on residential construction loans made to the owner/occupant have interest rates during the construction period of 0.5% or more above the rate offered by the Bank on the permanent loan product selected by the borrower. Upon completion of construction, the permanent loan rate will be set at the rate then offered by the Bank on that permanent loan product, not to exceed the predetermined permanent rate cap. Interest rates on residential construction loans to builders are set at the prime rate plus a margin of between 0% and 1% and adjust either monthly or daily. Interest rates on commercial construction loans are generally based on the prime rate plus a negotiated margin of between 0% and 1% and adjust either monthly or daily, with construction terms generally not exceeding 18 months. Advances are made on a percentage of completed basis. The Bank has restricted originating speculative construction loans, and has limited most new construction lending to those with contracts or pre-sales only. At December 31, 2009, residential and commercial construction loans totaled $3.0 million and $91.9 million, respectively, which amounted to 0.4% and 13.3%, respectively, of the Company’s gross loan portfolio. Prior to making a commitment to fund a loan, the Bank requires an appraisal of the property by appraisers approved by the Board of Directors for loans in excess of $250,000. For loans up to $250,000, the Bank requires an evaluation of the property by qualified Bank personnel, or in certain cases it may require an outside appraisal by an approved appraiser. The Bank also reviews and inspects each project at the commencement of construction and periodically during the term of the construction loan. The Bank generally charges a 0.0% to 1.25% construction loan fee for speculative builder loans. For construction loans to owner-occupants, the Bank generally charges a 0.0% to 1.0% construction loan fee. For residential construction loans, the Bank generally charges a commitment fee ranging from $275 to $750. Construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate and the borrower is unable to meet the Bank’s requirements of putting up additional funds to cover extra costs or change orders, then the Bank will demand that the loan be paid off and, if necessary, institute foreclosure proceedings, or refinance the loan. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with collateral having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. The Bank has sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to qualified borrowers (i.e., borrowers who satisfy all credit requirements and whose loans satisfy all other underwriting standards which would apply to the Bank’s permanent mortgage loan financing for the subject property) and limiting the loan-to-value amount. On loans to builders, the Bank works only with selected builders with whom it has experience and carefully monitors the creditworthiness of the builders. Builder relationships are analyzed and underwritten annually by the Bank’s credit administration department. Multi-Family Residential and Commercial Real Estate Lending. The Bank originates commercial real estate loans, as well as a limited amount of multi-family residential real estate loans, generally limiting such originations to loans secured by properties in its primary market area and to borrowers with whom it has other loan relationships. The Company’s multi-family residential loan portfolio consists primarily of loans secured by small apartment buildings, and the commercial real estate loan portfolio includes loans to finance the acquisition of small office buildings and commercial and industrial buildings with a preference to owner occupied. Such loans generally range in size from $100,000 to $2.0 million. At December 31, 2009, multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans totaled $867,000 and $419.0 million, respectively, which amounted to 0.1% and 60.5%, respectively, of the Company’s gross loan portfolio. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans are originated for three to seven year terms with interest rates that adjust based on either the prime rate as quoted in The Wall Street Journal plus a negotiated margin of between 0% and 1% for shorter term loans, or on a fixed-rate basis with interest calculated on a 15 to 25-year amortization schedule generally with a balloon payment due after three to seven years. 7 Multi-family residential and commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risks as compared with single-family residential property lending. Multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. The payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the real estate project, retail establishment or business. These risks can be significantly affected by supply and demand conditions in the market for office, retail and residential space, and, as such, may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy generally. To minimize these risks, the Bank generally limits itself to its market area or to borrowers with which it has prior experience or who are otherwise known to the Bank. It has been the Bank’s policy to obtain annual financial statements of the business of the borrower or the project for which commercial or multi-family residential real estate loans are made for loans over $1,000,000. In addition, in the case of commercial mortgage loans made to a partnership or a corporation, the Bank obtains personal guarantees from an owner with 20% or more interest in the company and for loans over $1,000,000 annual financial statements of the principals of the partnership or corporation. The Bank has severely restricted originating any new acquisition and development loans, lot loans or land loans. Commercial Lending. The Company’s commercial loans consist of loans secured by commercial real estate and commercial business loans, which are not secured by real estate. For a discussion of the Company’s commercial real estate lending see “— Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Lending.” As a commercial bank, the Bank originates commercial business loans. The Bank originates commercial business loans to small and medium sized businesses in its market area. The Bank’s commercial borrowers are generally small businesses engaged in manufacturing, distribution, retailing, service companies, or professionals in healthcare, accounting and law. Commercial business loans are generally made to finance the purchase of inventory, new or used equipment or commercial vehicles, to support trading assets and for short-term working capital. Such loans generally are secured by equipment and inventory, and, if possible, cross-collateralized by a real estate mortgage, although commercial business loans are sometimes granted on an unsecured basis. Such loans generally are made for terms of five years or less, depending on the purpose of the loan and the collateral, with loans to finance operating expenses made for one year or less, with interest rates that typically either adjust daily at a rate equal to the prime rate as stated in The Wall Street Journal plus a margin of between 0% and 2% or at a negotiated fixed rate. Generally, commercial loans are made in amounts ranging between $5,000 and $3,500,000. At December 31, 2009, commercial business loans totaled $26.1 million, or 3.8% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio. The Bank underwrites its commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower’s cash flow and ability to service the debt from earnings rather than relying solely on the basis of underlying collateral value, and the Bank seeks to structure such loans to have more than one source of repayment. The borrower is required to provide the Bank with sufficient information to allow the Bank to make its lending determination. In most instances, this information consists of at least two years of financial statements, a statement of projected cash flows, current financial information on any guarantor and any additional information on the collateral. For most commercial loans over $50,000 with maturities exceeding one year, the Bank requires that borrowers and guarantors provide updated financial information at least annually throughout the term of the loan. The Bank’s commercial business loans may be structured as short-term loans, term loans or as lines of credit. Short-term commercial business loans are for periods of 12 months or less and are generally self-liquidating from asset conversion cycles. Commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of assets and have maturities of five years or less. Commercial business lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of supporting trading assets and providing working capital. Such loans are usually approved with a term of 12 months and are reviewed annually. The Bank also offers secured standby letters of credit for its commercial borrowers. The terms of standby letters of credit generally do not exceed one year, and they are underwritten as stringently as any commercial loan and generally are of a performance nature. Commercial business loans are often larger and may involve greater risk than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation of the business involved, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting guidelines, which require that the loan be supported by adequate cash flow of the borrower, profitability of the business, collateral and personal guarantees of the individuals in the business. In addition, the Bank limits this type of lending to its market area and to borrowers with which it has prior experience or who are otherwise well known to the Bank. 8 Lease Receivables. The Bank’s lease receivables are originated by its wholly-owned subsidiary, First South Leasing, LLC (“FSL”). FSL offers leases on equipment utilized for business purposes. Rental terms generally range from 12 to 60 months and include options to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease. Most leases provide 100% of the cost of the equipment and are secured by the leased equipment. FSL requires the leased equipment to be insured and that FSL be listed as a loss payee and named an additional insured on the insurance policy. At December 31, 2009, lease receivables totaled $9.8 million, or 1.4% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio. Consumer Lending. In recent years, the Bank has also focused on originating consumer loans. The consumer loans originated by the Bank include automobile loans, certificate of deposit loans, home equity loans and miscellaneous other consumer loans, including unsecured loans. At December 31, 2009, consumer loans totaled $90.7 million, or 13.1% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio. The Bank’s automobile loans are generally underwritten in amounts up to 90% of the lesser of the purchase price of the automobile or, with respect to used automobiles, the resale value as published by the National Automobile Dealers Association. The terms of most such loans do not exceed 60 months. The Bank requires that the vehicles be insured and the Bank be listed as loss payee on the insurance policy. The Bank generally makes certificate of deposit loans for up to 90% of the depositor’s account balance, but may make a loan of up to 100% of the depositor’s account balance subject to approval by the credit administrator. The interest rate is normally 2% above the annual percentage yield paid on the account and the account must be pledged as collateral to secure the loan. Interest generally is billed on a monthly basis. At December 31, 2009, loans on certificates of deposit totaled $1.1 million, or 0.1% of the Company’s gross loan portfolio. At December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $37.1 million in home equity line of credit loans, representing approximately 5.4% of its gross loan portfolio. The Company’s home equity lines of credit have adjustable interest rates tied to the prime interest rate plus a margin. The home equity lines of credit require monthly payments based on the outstanding balance. Home equity lines of credit are generally secured by subordinate liens against residential real property. The Bank requires that fire and extended coverage casualty insurance (and if appropriate, flood insurance) be maintained in an amount at least sufficient to cover its loan. Home equity loans are generally limited so that the amount of such loans, along with any senior indebtedness, does not exceed 85% of the value of the real estate security. Consumer lending affords the Company the opportunity to earn yields higher than those obtainable on single-family residential lending. However, consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by events such as job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Further, the application of various state and federal laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency law, may limit the amount which may be recovered. In underwriting consumer loans, the Bank considers the borrower’s credit history, an analysis of the borrower’s income and ability to repay the loan, and the value of the collateral. Loan Fees and Servicing. The Bank receives fees in connection with late payments and for miscellaneous services related to its loans. The Bank also charges fees in connection with loan originations. These fees can consist of origination, discount, construction and/or commitment fees, depending on the type of loan. The Bank generally does not service loans for others except as set forth below and except for mortgage loans originated and sold by the Bank with servicing retained. In addition, the Bank has developed a program to originate residential mortgage loans for a local credit union. The Bank receives a 1% origination fee for each loan as well as an annual servicing fee of 0.375% of the loan amount. All of these loans are funded and closed in the name of the credit union. The Bank has explored the possibility of developing similar arrangements with other institutions, although none are currently planned. 9 Nonperforming Loans and Other Problem Assets. It is management’s policy to continually monitor its loan portfolio to anticipate and address potential and actual delinquencies. When a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan, the Bank takes immediate steps to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status. Loans which are delinquent more than 15 days incur a late fee of 4% on mortgage and consumer loans and up to 6% on commercial loans, of the monthly payment of principal and interest due. As a matter of policy, the Bank will contact the borrower after the loan has been delinquent 15 days. If payment is not promptly received, the borrower is contacted again, and efforts are made to formulate an affirmative plan to cure the delinquency. Generally, after any loan is delinquent 30 days or more, a default letter is sent to the borrower. If the default is not cured after 45 days from the default letter, formal legal proceedings may commence to collect amounts owed. Loans generally are placed on nonaccrual status, and accrued but unpaid interest is reversed, when, in management’s judgment, it is determined that the collectibility of interest, but not necessarily principal, is doubtful. Generally, this occurs when payment is delinquent in excess of 90 days. Consumer loans that have become more than 180 days past due are generally charged off, or a specific allowance may be provided for any expected loss. All other loans are charged off when management concludes that they are uncollectible. See Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto for additional information. Real estate acquired in settlement of loans is classified as real estate acquired through foreclosure until such time as it is sold. It is recorded at the lower of the estimated fair value (less estimated costs to sell) of the underlying real estate or the carrying amount of the loan. Costs relating to holding or improving such real estate is charged against income in the current period. Any required write-down of the loan to its fair value less estimated selling costs upon foreclosure is charged against the allowance for credit losses. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto for additional information. The following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank’s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. At December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis: Residential mortgage: Single-family $ 247 $ 382 $ 798 $ 934 $ 1,362 Commercial real estate (1) 8,941 13,458 6,588 1,274 555 Commercial business — 51 26 79 220 Consumer 994 1,111 143 453 122 Total nonperforming loans $ 10,181 $ 15,002 $ 7,555 $ 2,740 $ 2,259 Percentage of total loans, net 1.55 % 2.01 % 0.99 % 0.36 % 0.32 % Real estate owned $ 10,561 $ 7,711 $ 1,602 $ 634 $ 14 (1) Includes three restructured loans totaling $4.3 million at December 31, 2009, pursuant to financial accounting standards. During the year ended December 31, 2009, additional gross interest income of approximately $471,000 would have been recorded on loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis if the loans had been current throughout this period. Aside from the loans defined as nonaccrual, over 90 days past due, classified, or restructured, there were no loans at December 31, 2009, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and may result in disclosure as nonaccrual, over 90 days past due or restructured. There were 13 loans totaling $1.8 million which were accruing interest and contractually over 90 days past due at December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, additional gross interest income of approximately $36,000 was recorded on these loans. 10 Based on an impairment analysis of the Bank’s portfolio, there were $23.0 million of loans classified as impaired, with total impairment of $5.1 million as of December 31, 2009. Accordingly, the Bank has established specific allowance for loan losses for this impairment. A loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan arrangement. Uncollateralized loans are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate, while all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. The Bank uses several factors in determining if a loan is impaired. The internal asset classification procedures include a thorough review of significant loans and lending relationships and include the accumulation of related data. This data includes loan payments status, borrowers’ financial data and borrowers’ operating factors such as cash flows, operating income or loss, and various other matters. See Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto for additional information. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $10.2 million of nonaccrual loans, consisting of four single-family residential mortgage loans totaling $247,000; four single family residential commercial construction loans totaling $1.1 million; eight commercial residential real estate term loans totaling $4.6 million; six commercial non-residential real estate term loans totaling $1.1 million; nine commercial land loans totaling $2.2 million; and eleven consumer loans totaling $994,000. At December 31, 2009, the Bank had $10.6 million of real estate owned, which consisted of 24 single-family residences, 14 vacant lots, one residential subdivision containing raw land and 44 developed lots, one land loan and two commercial properties. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto for additional information. Classified Assets and Credit Quality. Federal regulations require that the Bank classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, examiners have authority to identify problem assets and if appropriate, classify them in their reports of examination. There are four classifications for problem assets: “special mention,” “substandard,” “doubtful” and “loss.” Special mention assets contain a potential weakness that deserve management’s close attention and which could cause a more serious problem if not corrected. Substandard assets have one or more well-defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as a loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. Assets classified as special mention, substandard or doubtful require a bank to establish general allowances for loan losses. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, a bank must either establish a specific allowance for loss in the amount of the portion of the asset classified as loss, or charge off such amount. Work-in-process loans are loans that have been approved and sent to the attorney for closing, but have not yet been returned for processing. These loans are not given a risk grade until they have been processed and are therefore excluded from the credit quality reporting. The Bank assigns a risk grade to each commercial loan. The grading system established by the Bank includes grades 1 through 9. These grades are defined as follows: “1” is Excellent and considered to be of the highest quality with significant financial strength, stability, and liquidity; “2” is Above Average and supported by above average financial strength and stability; “3” is Average and supported by upper tier industry-average financial strength and stability; “4” is Acceptable and supported by lower end industry-average financial strength and stability; “5” is Watch and has been identified by the lender as a loan that has shown some degree of deterioration from its original status; “6” is Special Mention; “7” is Substandard; “8” is Doubtful; and “9” is Loss. The Bank reviews its loan portfolio not less than quarterly to determine whether any assets require classification or re-classification. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $84.0 million of classified assets, including $34.6 million classified as special mention, $44.3 million classified as substandard, none classified as doubtful and $5.1 million classified as loss; compared to $57.9 million of classified assets at December 31, 2008, including $29.1 million classified as special mention, $27.3 million classified as substandard, none classified as doubtful and $1.5 million classified as loss. 11 The following tables set forth information with respect to the Bank’s credit exposure at the dates indicated.

The Bank maintains both general and specific allowances for loan and lease losses and an allowance for unfunded loan commitments (collectively, the “allowance for credit losses”) at levels the Bank believes are appropriate in light of the risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments. The Bank has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk and impairment analysis. Future assessments of credit risk may yield different results, depending on changes in the qualitative and quantitative trends, which may require increases or decreases in the allowance for loan credit losses. The Bank uses a variety of modeling and estimation tools for measuring its credit risk and performing impairment analysis, which is the basis used in developing the allowance for credit losses. The Bank’s principal focus is on maintaining the adequacy of the total allowance for credit losses. Based on the overall credit quality of the loan and lease receivable portfolio, the Bank believes it has established the allowance for credit losses pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment. Management evaluates the information upon which it bases the allowance for credit losses quarterly and believes its accounting decisions remain accurate. However, there can be no assurance in the future that regulators, increased risks in its loans and leases portfolio, changes in economic conditions and other factors will not require additional adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. 12 See Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto for additional information regarding lending activities and the allowance for credit losses.

The assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses includes an analysis of qualitative and quantitative trends in the levels of both classified and pass loans. In developing this analysis, the Bank relies on estimates and exercises management’s best judgment in assessing credit risk. The following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank’s allocation of quantitative percentage factors used in determining the allowance for credit losses for each of the loan categories and risk grades at December 31, 2009. Allocation of Quantitative Percentage Factors by Assigned Risk Grade Category 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Commercial Real Estate 100.00 % 20.00 % 10.00 % 5.00 % 0.45 % 0.35 % 0.35 % 0.20 % 0.10 % Commercial Non-Real Estate Secured 100.00 % 50.00 % 12.00 % 5.00 % 0.45 % 0.35 % 0.35 % 0.20 % 0.10 % Commercial Non-Real Estate Unsecured 100.00 % 50.00 % 15.00 % 7.50 % 0.45 % 0.35 % 0.35 % 0.20 % 0.10 % Consumer Real Estate 100.00 % 20.00 % 10.00 % 5.00 % N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Consumer Non-Real Estate Secured 100.00 % 50.00 % 20.00 % 10.00 % N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Consumer Non-Real Estate Unsecured 100.00 % 50.00 % 25.00 % 15.00 % N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Residential Real Estate 100.00 % 15.00 % 10.00 % 5.00 % N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Lease Receivables 100.00 % 50.00 % 20.00 % 10.00 % N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Pass Loans and Leases Unfunded Commitments Consumer Loans 0.50 % Commercial Real Estate Lines of Credit 0.25 % Home Equity Lines of Credit 0.45 % Commercial Non-Real Estate Lines of Credit 0.25 % Reserve Lines of Credit 0.75 % Commercial Standby Letters of Credit 0.25 % Mortgage Loans 0.35 % Home Equity Lines of Credit 0.25 % Lease Receivables 1.30 % Consumer Real Estate Lines of Credit 0.25 % Work-in-Process 0.25 % Consumer Non-Real Estate Lines of Credit 0.25 % The following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank’s allocation of qualitative factors, including various subjective areas assessed in terms of basis points used in determining the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) as of December 31, 2009. The determination of risk will result in a positive or negative adjustment to the ACL evaluation and validation. Adjustments for each component may range from -10 basis points to +10 basis points. A component score of 0 basis points indicates no effect on the ACL. A component rating of +10 basis points indicates the assessed maximum potential of increased risk to the adequacy of the ACL. A -10 basis point component rating indicates the most positive effect on the ACL.

Interest income from mortgage-backed securities and investment securities generally provides the second largest source of income to the Company after interest on loans. The Bank’s Board of Directors has authorized investment in U.S. Government and agency securities, state government obligations, municipal securities, obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and mortgage-backed securities. The Bank’s objective is to use such investments to reduce credit risk and provide liquidity. At December 31, 2009, the Company’s mortgage-backed securities and investment securities portfolio amounted to $97.2 million and $407,000, respectively. At such date, the Company had an unrealized gain of $322,000, net of deferred taxes, with respect to its securities. Investment and aggregate investment limitations and credit quality parameters of each class of investment are prescribed in the Bank’s investment policy. The Bank performs an analysis on mortgage-backed securities and investment securities on a quarterly basis to determine the impact on earnings and market value under various interest rate scenarios and prepayment conditions. Securities purchases are subject to the oversight of the Bank’s Investment Committee consisting of four directors and are reviewed by the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. The Bank’s President has authority to make specific investment decisions within the parameters determined by the Board of Directors. 17 Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2009, the Company’s mortgage-backed securities amounted to $97.2 million, or 11.7% of total assets. Mortgage-backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, the principal and interest payments on which are passed from the mortgage originators through intermediaries that pool and repackage the participation interest in the form of securities to investors such as the Bank. Such intermediaries may include government sponsored entities such as FHLMC, the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”, also known as “Fannie Mae”) and the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”, also known as “Ginnie Mae”) which guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally increase the quality of the Bank’s assets by virtue of the guarantees that back them, are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations of the Bank. At December 31, 2009, all of the Company’s mortgage-backed securities were backed by loans originated by the Bank and swapped with the FHLMC in exchange for such mortgage-backed securities. The FHLMC is a public corporation chartered by the U.S. Government. The FHLMC issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans. The FHLMC guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates. FHLMC securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States; however, their securities are considered to be good quality investments with marginal credit risks. The maximum loan limit for FNMA and FHLMC currently is $417,000. Mortgage-backed securities typically are issued with stated principal amounts, and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a range and having varying maturities. The underlying pool of mortgages can be composed of either fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans. As a result, the risk characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages, (i.e., fixed-rate or adjustable-rate) as well as prepayment risk, are passed on to the certificate holder. The life of a mortgage-backed pass-through security thus approximates the life of the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans which underlie such securities because of their payment guarantees or credit enhancements which offer nominal credit risk. In addition, mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings of the Bank in the event that the Bank determined to utilize borrowings as a source of funds. Mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the FHLMC are weighted at no more than 20% for risk-based capital purposes, compared to a weight of 50% to 100% for residential loans. See “Depository Institution Regulation — Capital Requirements.” At December 31, 2009, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $96.1 million and a carrying value of $96.7 million were held as available for sale, and mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $514,000 and a carrying value of $514,000 were held for investment. Mortgage-backed securities which are held to maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts using a method which approximates a level yield. Mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale mortgage-backed securities are recognized as direct increases or decreases in equity, net of applicable income taxes. At December 31, 2009, the Bank’s mortgage-backed securities had a weighted average yield of 4.50%. See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto for additional information. At December 31, 2009, the average contractual maturity of the Company’s fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities available for sale was approximately 24.4 years, while the average contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities held for investment was approximately 3.7 years. The actual maturity of a mortgage-backed security varies, depending on when the mortgagors prepay or repay the underlying mortgages. Prepayments of the underlying mortgages may shorten the life of the investment, thereby adversely affecting its yield to maturity and the related market value of the mortgage-backed security. The yield is based upon the interest income and the amortization of the premium or accretion of the discount related to the mortgage-backed security. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted over the estimated term of the securities using a level yield method. The prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage-backed security, and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect the actual prepayment. The actual prepayments of the underlying mortgages depend on many factors, including the type of mortgage, the coupon rate, the age of the mortgages, the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates. The difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates is an important determinant in the rate of prepayments. During periods of falling mortgage interest rates, prepayments generally increase, and, conversely, during periods of rising mortgage interest rates, prepayments generally decrease. If the coupon rate of the underlying mortgage significantly exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans, refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages. Prepayment experience is more difficult to estimate for adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. 18 Investment Securities. Investments in certain securities are classified into three categories and accounted for as follows: (1) debt securities bought with the intent to hold to maturity are classified as held for investment and reported at amortized cost; (2) debt and equity securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; (3) debt and equity securities not classified as either held for investment securities or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of equity. The Company had no investment securities at December 31, 2009. The Bank purchased $5.0 million of investment securities as available for sale during 2009. During 2009, there were $20.0 million of maturities and $20.9 million of sales of investment securities available for sale, respectively. Proceeds from investment maturities and sales are used in daily liquidity management activities including funding borrowing maturities, deposit withdrawals or are reinvested into new investment securities or short-term interest bearing overnight funds. Equity Securities. The Company’s equity securities consist of shares of restricted common stock of Triangle Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: TCAP) received in 2007 upon completion the TCAP public offering. Prior to the public offering, the Company was a 2.2% limited partner in the Triangle Mezzanine Fund, LLLP, with a limited investment of $500,000. In the public offering, TCAP acquired the Triangle Mezzanine Fund, LLLP, and the limited partners received shares of TCAP restricted common stock in amounts equivalent to their limited investment in the Triangle Mezzanine Fund, LLLP. TCAP is a specialty finance company organized to provide customized financing solutions to lower middle market companies located throughout the United States, with an emphasis on the Southeast. At December 31, 2009, the TCAP equity securities owned by the Company had a market value of approximately $407,000. The Company had $3.9 million of FHLB stock at December 31, 2009. The following table sets forth the carrying value of the Company’s investment, mortgage-backed, and equity securities portfolio at the dates indicated. See Notes 1, 2 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto for additional information.

Deposits are the primary source of the Bank’s funds for lending, investment activities and general operational purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan principal and interest repayments, maturities of investment securities and mortgage-backed securities and interest payments thereon. Although loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds, or on a longer term basis for general operational purposes. The Bank has access to borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta. Deposits. The Bank attracts deposits principally from within its market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, statement savings accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts, and certificates of deposit which range in maturity from seven days to five years. Deposit terms vary according to the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Maturities, terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties for its deposit accounts are established by the Bank on a periodic basis. The Bank reviews its deposit pricing on a weekly basis or more frequently based on market conditions. In determining the characteristics of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers the rates offered by competing institutions, lending and liquidity requirements, growth goals and federal regulations. Management believes it prices its deposits comparably to rates offered by its competitors. The Bank does not accept brokered deposits. The Bank attempts to compete for deposits with other institutions in its market area by offering competitively priced deposit instruments that are tailored to the needs of its customers. Additionally, the Bank seeks to meet customers’ needs by providing convenient customer service to the community, efficient staff and convenient hours of service. Substantially all of the Bank’s depositors are North Carolina residents. To provide additional convenience, the Bank participates in the Cirrus and STAR Automatic Teller Machine networks at locations throughout the United States, through which customers can gain access to their accounts at any time. To better serve its customers, the Bank has installed automatic teller machines at twenty-five office locations. The following tables set forth the distribution of the Bank’s deposit accounts and corresponding weighted average interest rates. Management does not believe that the use of year-end balances instead of average balances resulted in any material difference in the information presented. At December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Amount Weighted Average Rate Amount Weighted Average Rate Amount Weighted Average Rate (Dollars in thousands) Demand accounts: Checking $ 212,502 0.11 % $ 208,923 0.22 % $ 227,601 0.97 % Money market 12,006 0.19 14,445 0.20 16,047 2.22 Savings accounts 23,137 0.13 26,554 0.38 17,498 0.15 Total 247,645 0.12 249,922 0.24 261,146 0.99 Certificate accounts: Less than 12 months (1) 74,914 1.42 102,250 3.13 225,839 4.58 12-14 months (1) 274,384 1.80 266,768 3.66 227,626 4.94 15-72 months (1) 91,568 3.41 97,487 3.95 46,759 4.30 Total 440,866 2.07 466,505 3.61 500,224 4.72 Total deposits $ 688,511 1.32 % $ 716,427 2.43 % $ 761,370 3.44 % (1) Original term.

At such date, such deposits represented 35.5% of total deposits and had a weighted average rate of 2.20%. Maturity Period (In thousands) Three months or less $ 519 Over three months 24,099 Over six through 12 months 126,649 Over 12 months 72,932 Total $ 224,199 At December 31, 2009, FHLMC mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $6.2 million were pledged as collateral for deposits from public entities and repurchase agreements. Borrowings. Deposits historically have been the primary source of funds for the Bank’s lending, investment and general operating activities. The Bank is authorized, however, to use advances from the FHLB of Atlanta to supplement its supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The FHLB of Atlanta functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions. As a member of the FHLB System, the Bank is required to own stock in the FHLB of Atlanta and is authorized to apply for advances. Advances are pursuant to several different programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. The FHLB capital stock requirement is based on the sum of a membership stock component totaling 0.20% of the Bank’s total assets plus an activity-based stock component of 4.5% of outstanding FHLB advances. Advances from the FHLB of Atlanta are secured by the Bank’s stock in the FHLB of Atlanta and other eligible assets. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Bank’s borrowings consisted of FHLB advances and retail repurchase agreements. Retail repurchase agreements represent agreements to sell securities under terms which require the Bank to repurchase the same or substantially similar securities by a specified date. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto for additional information. The following table sets forth certain information regarding short-term borrowings by the Company at the dates and for the periods indicated: At or for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Amounts outstanding at end of periods: FHLB advances $ 35,000 $ 45,000 $ 35,000 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements 2,380 7,558 7,067 Rate paid on: FHLB advances 3.04 % 3.01 % 4.40 % Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase 0.25 % 0.25 % 3.38 % Maximum amount of borrowings outstanding at any month end: FHLB advances 50,500 53,000 40,800 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements 7,146 12,805 9,198 Approximate average short-term borrowings outstanding with respect to: FHLB advances 41,081 45,274 9,155 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements 4,907 9,671 7,221 Approximate weighted average rate paid on: (1) FHLB advances 3.00 % 3.07 % 5.01 % Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements 0.25 % 1.81 % 4.34 % (1) Based on month-end balances. 22 Competition The Company faces strong competition in originating real estate, commercial business and consumer loans and in attracting deposits. The Bank competes for real estate and other loans principally on the basis of interest rates, the types of loans it originates, the deposit products it offers and the quality of services it provides to borrowers. The Bank also competes by offering products which are tailored to the local community, including lease financing. Its competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers. Commercial banks, credit unions and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. Competition may increase as a result of the reduction of restrictions on the interstate operations of financial institutions. The Bank attracts its deposits through its branch offices primarily from the local communities. Consequently, competition for deposits is principally from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and brokers in the Bank’s primary market area. The Bank competes for deposits and loans by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, a commitment to outstanding customer service and a well-trained staff. The Bank believes it has developed strong relationships with local realtors and the community in general. The Bank’s primary market area for gathering deposits and/or originating loans is central, eastern, northeastern and southeastern North Carolina, where the Bank’s offices are located. In addition, the Bank makes securities brokerage services available through an affiliation with an independent broker-dealer. Employees As of December 31, 2009, the Bank had 264 full-time and 29 part-time employees, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers the Bank’s relationships with its employees to be good. Depository Institution Regulation General. The Bank is a North Carolina chartered commercial bank and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Bank is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks (“Commissioner”) and the FDIC and to North Carolina and federal statutory and regulatory provisions governing such matters as capital standards, mergers, subsidiary investments and establishment of branch offices. The FDIC also has the authority to conduct special examinations. The Bank is required to file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition and will be required to obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, including mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. As a federally insured depository institution, the Bank is subject to various regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) or (“FRB”), including Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity), Regulation D (Reserve Requirements), Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfers), Regulation Z (Truth in Lending), Regulation CC (Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks) and Regulation DD (Truth in Savings). The system of regulation and supervision applicable to the Bank establishes a comprehensive framework for the operations of the Bank, and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC and the depositors of the Bank, rather than shareholders. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material effect on the Bank that in turn, could have a material effect on the Company. Certain of the legal and regulatory requirements are applicable to the Bank and Company. This discussion does not purport to be a complete explanation of all such laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations involved. 23 Capital Requirements. The FRB and the FDIC have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $150 million or more and state nonmember banks, respectively. The regulations impose two sets of capital adequacy requirements: minimum leverage rules, which require bank holding companies and state nonmember banks to maintain a specified minimum ratio of capital to total assets, and risk-based capital rules, which require the maintenance of specified minimum ratios of capital to “risk-weighted” assets. The regulations of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board require bank holding companies and state nonmember banks, respectively, to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of “Tier 1 capital” to total assets of 3.0%. Although setting a minimum 3.0% leverage ratio, the capital regulations state that only the strongest bank holding companies and banks, with composite examination ratings of 1 under the “CAMELS” rating system used by the federal bank regulators, are permitted to operate at or near such minimum level of capital. All other bank holding companies and banks must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%. Tier 1 capital is the sum of common stockholders’ equity, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (including any related surplus), and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries; minus all intangible assets (other than certain purchased mortgage servicing rights and credit card receivables), identified losses and certain investments. As a DIF-insured, state chartered bank, the Bank must also deduct from Tier 1 capital an amount equal to its investments in, and extensions of credit to, subsidiaries engaged in activities that are not permissible for national banks, other than debt and equity investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities or in subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies. Any bank or bank holding company experiencing or anticipating significant growth is expected to maintain capital well above the minimum levels. In addition, the FRB has indicated that whenever appropriate, and in particular when a bank holding company is undertaking expansion, seeking to engage in new activities or otherwise facing unusual or abnormal risks, it will consider, on a case-by-case basis, the level of an organization’s ratio of tangible Tier 1 capital to total assets in making an overall assessment of capital. In addition to the leverage ratio, the regulations of the FRB and the FDIC require bank holding companies and state chartered nonmember banks to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0% of which at least 4.0% must be Tier 1 capital. Qualifying total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or “supplementary capital” items which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity of 20 years or more, certain other capital instruments and up to 45% of unrealized gains on equity securities. The includible amount of Tier 2 capital cannot exceed the institution’s Tier 1 capital. Qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount of the bank’s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes, reciprocal cross-holdings of capital securities issued by other banks and certain other deductions. The risk-based capital regulations assign balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off-balance sheet items to one of four broad risk weight categories ranging from 0% to 100%. The aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category based principally on the degree of credit risk associated with the obligor. The sum of these weighted values equals the bank holding company or the bank’s risk-weighted assets. In addition to FDIC regulatory capital requirements, the Commissioner requires that the Bank have adequate capitalization based upon each Bank’s particular set of circumstances. The Bank is subject to the Commissioner’s capital surplus regulation which requires commercial banks to maintain a capital surplus of at least 50% of common capital. Common capital is defined as the total of the par value of shares times the number of shares outstanding. Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements, including a leverage limit, a risk-based capital requirement, and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution. All institutions, regardless of their capital levels, are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees if the institution would thereafter fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements. An institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure (an “undercapitalized institution”) may be: (i) subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator; (ii) required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within 45 days; (iii) subject to asset growth limits; and (iv) required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions, branching and new lines of businesses. The capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution’s holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized on average for four consecutive quarters, under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed to comply with its capital restoration plan. A “significantly undercapitalized” institution, as well as any undercapitalized institution that does not submit an acceptable capital restoration plan, may be subject to regulatory demands for recapitalization, broader application of restrictions on transactions with affiliates, limitations on interest rates paid on deposits, asset growth and other activities, possible replacement of directors and officers, and restrictions on capital distributions by any bank holding company controlling the institution. Any company controlling the institution may also be required to divest the institution or the institution could be required to divest subsidiaries. The senior executive officers of a significantly undercapitalized institution may not receive bonuses or increases in compensation without prior approval and the institution is prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on its subordinated debt. In their discretion, the federal banking regulators may also impose the foregoing sanctions on an undercapitalized institution if the regulators determine that such actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions. If an institution’s ratio of tangible capital to total assets falls below the “critical capital level” established by the appropriate federal banking regulator, the institution will be subject to conservatorship or receivership within specified time periods. 24 Under the implementing regulations, the federal banking regulators, including the FDIC, generally measure an institution’s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk-based capital ratio (the ratio of its total capital to risk-weighted assets), Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (the ratio of its core capital to risk-weighted assets) and leverage ratio (the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets). The following table shows the actual and required capital ratios for the various prompt corrective action categories as of December 31, 2009. Adequately Significantly Actual Well Capitalized Capitalized Undercapitalized Undercapitalized Total risk-based capital ratio 13.52 % 10.0% or more 8.0% or more Less than 8.0% Less than 6.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 12.26 % 6.0% or more 4.0% or more Less than 4.0% Less than 3.0% Leverage ratio 9.56 % 5.0% or more 4.0% or more * Less than 4.0% * Less than 3.0% * 3.0% if institution has a composite 1 CAMELS rating. A “critically undercapitalized” institution is defined as an institution that has a ratio of “tangible equity” to total assets of less than 2.0%. Tangible equity is defined as core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock (and related surplus) less all intangibles other than qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights. The FDIC may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory actions applicable to institutions in the next lower capital category (but may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) if the FDIC determines, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less-than-satisfactory rating for any CAMELS rating category. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto for additional information. Safety and Soundness Guidelines. Under FDICIA, as amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (the “CDRI Act”), each federal banking agency was required to establish safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. The interagency guidelines require depository institutions to maintain internal controls and information systems and internal audit systems that are appropriate for the size, nature and scope of the institution’s business. The guidelines also establish certain basic standards for loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth and information security. The guidelines further provide that depository institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation, fees and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss, and should take into account factors such as comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that a depository institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines, it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines. A depository institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to its primary federal regulator within 30 days of receipt of a request for such a plan. Failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. Management believes that the Bank substantially meets all the standards adopted in the interagency guidelines. Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank, like other financial institutions, is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). The purpose of the CRA is to encourage financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including the needs of low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. 25 The federal banking agencies have implemented an evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community credit needs. Under these regulations, an institution is first evaluated and rated under three categories: a lending test, an investment test and a service test. For each of these three tests, the institution is given a rating of either “outstanding,” “high satisfactory,” “low satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial non-compliance.” A set of criteria for each rating has been developed and is included in the regulation. If an institution disagrees with a particular rating, the institution has the burden of rebutting the presumption by clearly establishing that the quantitative measures do not accurately present its actual performance, or that demographics, competitive conditions or economic or legal limitations peculiar to its service area should be considered. The ratings received under the three tests will be used to determine the overall composite CRA rating. The composite ratings currently given are: “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial non-compliance.” The Bank’s CRA rating would be a factor to be considered by the FRB and the FDIC in considering applications submitted by the Bank to acquire branches or to acquire or combine with other financial institutions and take other actions and, if such rating was less than “satisfactory,” could result in the denial of such applications. During the Bank’s last compliance examination, the Bank received an outstanding rating with respect to CRA compliance. Federal Home Loan Bank System. The FHLB System consists of 12 district FHLBs subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Board (“FHFB”). The FHLBs provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with investment in FHLB of Atlanta stock at December 31, 2009, of $3.9 million. The FHLB of Atlanta serves as a reserve or central bank for its member institutions within its assigned district. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It offers advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHFB and the Board of Directors of the FHLB of Atlanta. Long-term advances may only be made for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance, small businesses, small farms and small agribusinesses. Reserves. Pursuant to regulations of the FRB, the Bank must maintain average daily reserves equal to 3% on transaction accounts of $10.7 million up to $55.2 million, plus 10% on the remainder. This percentage is subject to adjustment by the FRB. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution’s interest-earning assets. As of December 31, 2009, the Bank met its reserve requirements. The Bank is also subject to the reserve requirements of North Carolina commercial banks. North Carolina law requires state nonmember banks to maintain, at all times, a reserve fund in an amount set by the Commissioner. Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to limits set by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “Stabilization Act”) was enacted to temporarily raise the standard limit of FDIC insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. On May 20, 2009, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount (SMDIA) to per depositor through December 31, 2013. On January 1, 2014, the standard insurance amount will return to $100,000 per depositor for all account categories except IRAs and certain other retirement accounts, which will remain at $250,000 per depositor, unless a new law is enacted before then to extend the increased deposit insurance limits. The FDIC has amended its risk-based assessment system to implement authority granted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (“Reform Act”). Under the revised system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. Risk Category I, which contains the least risky depository institutions, is expected to include a majority of all insured institutions. Unlike the other categories, Risk Category I contains further risk differentiation based on the FDIC’s analysis of financial ratios, examination component ratings and other information. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Bank was assigned to Risk Category I. The Reform Act provided the FDIC with authority to adjust the Deposit Insurance Fund ratio to insured deposits within a range of 1.15% and 1.50%, in contrast to the prior statutorily fixed ratio of 1.25%. Assessment rates are determined by the FDIC and currently range from 5 to 7 basis points annually of assessable deposits for the healthiest institutions (Risk Category I) to 43 basis points for the riskiest (Risk Category IV). The FDIC may adjust assessment rates from one quarter to the next, except that no single adjustment can exceed 3 basis points. The Bank’s quarterly Deposit Insurance Fund assessments during the year ended December 31, 2009 ranged from 1.67 to 3.86 basis points of assessable deposits. 26 The Reform Act also provided for a one-time credit for eligible insured institutions based on their assessment base as of December 31, 1996. Subject to certain limitations with respect to institutions that are exhibiting weaknesses, one-time credits are used to offset quarterly assessments until exhausted. The Bank’s original one-time assessment credit was $405,964. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Bank used the remaining $106,622 of its one-time assessment credits to offset March and June 2008 quarterly assessments, exhausting its one-time assessment credit. The Reform Act also provided that the FDIC may pay dividends to insured institutions once the Deposit Insurance fund reserve ratio equals or exceeds 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, insured institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”), established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to recapitalize the former Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation (“FSLIC”) deposit insurance fund. The Bank’s quarterly FICO payments during the year ended December 31, 2009 averaged 1.04 basis points of assessable deposits. On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the “TLGP”) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TLGP consists of two components: a temporary guarantee of newly-issued senior unsecured debt named the Debt Guarantee Program, and a temporary unlimited guarantee of funds in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at FDIC insured institutions named the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (“TAG”). All newly-issued senior unsecured debt will be charged an annual assessment of up to 100 basis points (depending on term) multiplied by the amount of debt issued and calculated through the date of that debt or June 30, 2012, whichever is earlier. The Bank elected to opt out of the Debt Guarantee Program. The Bank elected to participate in the TAG Program and as a result, does not anticipate a material increase in its deposit insurance premiums. On August 26, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule extending the TAG portion of the TLGP for six months through June 30, 2010. As a Risk Category I bank, for amounts exceeding the existing $250,000 deposit insurance limit in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts the Bank will be assessed an annualized fee of 15 basis points and collected quarterly through June 30, 2010. On November 12, 2009, the FDIC voted to require all FDIC insured depository institutions to prepay risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The prepaid assessments are designed to provide the FDIC with additional liquid assets for the DIF, which have been used to protect depositors of failed institutions and have been exchanged for less liquid claims against the assets of failed institutions. The FDIC projected that if no action is taken, its liquidity needs to resolve failures could exceed its liquid assets beginning in the first quarter of 2010. The prepaid assessment for all insured institutions was collected on December 30, 2009. For the fourth quarter of 2009 and all of 2010, the prepaid assessment was based on an institution’s total base assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009. That rate will be increased by 3 basis points for the 2011 and 2012 prepayments and a quarterly five percent deposit growth rate is also built into the calculation. On December 30, 2009, the Bank paid a $4.7 million prepaid assessment and it will be accounted for as a prepaid expense with a zero risk-weighting for risk-based regulatory capital purposes. On a quarterly basis after December 31, 2009, the Bank will expense its regular quarterly assessment and record an offsetting credit to the prepaid assessment asset until the asset is exhausted. If the prepaid assessment is not exhausted by June 30, 2013, any remaining amount will be returned to the Bank. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an insured institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management of the Bank is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of its FDIC deposit insurance. Liquidity Requirements. FDIC policy requires that banks maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets (cash, certain time deposits, mortgage-backed securities, loans available for sale and specified United States government, state, or federal agency obligations) in an amount which it deems adequate to protect safety and soundness of the bank. The FDIC currently has no specific level which it requires. The Bank maintains its liquidity position under policy guidelines based on liquid assets in relationship to deposits and short-term borrowings. Based on its policy calculation guidelines, the Bank’s calculated liquidity ratio was 17.8% of total deposits and short-term borrowings at December 31, 2009, which management believes is adequate. 27 Dividend Restrictions. Under FDIC regulations, the Bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if after making the distribution, the Bank would have: (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%; or (iii) a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. Limits on Loans to One Borrower. The Bank generally is subject to both FDIC regulations and North Carolina law regarding loans to any one borrower, including related entities. Under applicable law, with certain limited exceptions, loans and extensions of credit by a state chartered nonmember bank to a person outstanding at one time and not fully secured by collateral having a market value at least equal to the amount of the loan or extension of credit shall not exceed 15% of the unimpaired capital of the Bank. Loans and extensions of credit fully secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value at least equal to the amount of the loan or extension of credit shall not exceed 10% of the unimpaired capital fund of the Bank. Under these limits, the Bank’s loans to one borrower were limited to $14.1 million at December 31, 2009. At that date, the Bank had no lending relationships in excess of the loans-to-one-borrower limit. Notwithstanding the statutory loans-to-one-borrower limitations, the Bank has a self imposed loans-to-one-borrower limit, which currently is $7.2 million, which it has exceeded from time to time as approved in advance by the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2009, the Bank’s largest lending relationship was a $8.1 million relationship consisting of 14 commercial real estate loans and one consumer loan. All loans within this relationship were current and performing in accordance with their terms at December 31, 2009. Transactions with Related Parties. Transactions between a state nonmember bank and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a state nonmember bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the state nonmember bank. In a holding company context, the parent holding company of a state nonmember bank (such as the Company) and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the savings institution or state nonmember bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B (i) limit the extent to which an institution or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar other types of transactions. Loans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Stockholders. State nonmember banks also are subject to the restrictions contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the applicable regulations thereunder on loans to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, executive officer and to a greater than 10% stockholder of a state nonmember bank and certain affiliated interests of such persons, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the institution’s loans-to-one-borrower limit and all loans to such persons may not exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(h) also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders of a depository institution, and their respective affiliates, unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the institution with any “interested” director not participating in the voting. Regulation O prescribes the loan amount (which includes all other outstanding loans to such person) as to which such prior board of director approval is required as being the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (or any loans aggregating $500,000 or more). Further, Section 22(h) requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders generally be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons. Section 22(h) also generally prohibits a depository institution from paying the overdrafts of any of its executive officers or directors. State nonmember banks also are subject to the requirements and restrictions of Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act on loans to executive officers. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act requires approval by the board of directors of a depository institution for such extensions of credit and imposes reporting requirements for and additional restrictions on the type, amount and terms of credits to such officers. In addition, Section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) prohibits extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 28 Additionally, North Carolina statutes set forth restrictions on loans to executive officers of state chartered banks, which provide that no bank may extend credit to any of its executive officers nor a firm or partnership of which such executive officers is a member, nor a company in which such executive officer owns a controlling interest, unless the extension of credit is made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions by the bank with persons who are not employed by the bank, and provided further that the extension of credit does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. Restrictions on Certain Activities. State chartered nonmember banks with deposits insured by the FDIC are generally prohibited from engaging in equity investments that are not permissible for a national bank. The foregoing limitation, however, does not prohibit FDIC-insured state banks from acquiring or retaining an equity investment in a subsidiary in which the bank is a majority owner. State chartered banks are also prohibited from engaging as a principal in any type of activity that is not permissible for a national bank and, subject to certain exceptions, subsidiaries of state chartered FDIC-insured state banks may not engage as a principal in any type of activity that is not permissible for a subsidiary of a national bank, unless in either case, the FDIC determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund and the bank is, and continues to be, in compliance with applicable capital standards. USA Patriot Act. The USA Patriot Act (“Patriot Act”) is intended to strengthen U.S. law enforcement’s and the intelligence communities’ abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The impact of the Patriot Act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Regulation of the Company General. The Company, as the sole shareholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company and is registered with the Federal Reserve Board. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FRB under the BHCA, and the regulations of the FRB. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the FRB annual reports and such additional information as the FRB may require, and is subject to regular examinations by the FRB. The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries, including its bank subsidiaries. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain FRB approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. In evaluating applications for acquisitions, the FRB considers such things as the financial condition and management of the target and the acquirer, the convenience and needs of the communities involved (including CRA ratings) and competitive factors. The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain nonbank activities which, by statute or by FRB regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The list of activities permitted by the FRB includes, among other things, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers’ checks and United States Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. The Company currently engages in some of these permitted activities through the Bank, but has no present plans to operate a credit card company or factoring company, perform data processing operations, real estate and personal property appraising or provide tax planning and tax preparation services. 29 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) authorized bank holding companies that meet specified qualitative standards to opt to become a “financial holding company.” A financial holding company may engage in activities that are permissible for bank holding companies in addition to activities deemed to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. These include insurance underwriting and investment banking. The Company has not opted to become a financial holding company. The FRB has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See “— Depository Institution Regulation — Capital Requirements.” Acquisition of Bank Holding Companies and Banks. Under the BHCA, any company must obtain approval of the FRB prior to acquiring control of the Company or the Bank. For purposes of the BHCA, “control” is defined as ownership of more than 25% of any class of voting securities of the Company or the Bank, the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors, or the exercise of a controlling influence over management or policies of the Company or the Bank. The Change in Bank Control Act (“CBCA”) and the related regulations of the FRB require any person or persons acting in concert, to file a written notice with the FRB before such person or persons may acquire control of the Company or the Bank. The CBCA defines “control” as the power, directly or indirectly, to vote 25% or more of any voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank; however, a rebuttable presumption of control exists upon the acquisition of power to vote 10% or more of a class of voting securities for a company, such as the Company, whose securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Interstate Banking. Federal law allows the FRB to approve an application of an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than the holding company’s home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The FRB may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for a minimum of five years without regard for a longer minimum period specified by the law of the host state. The FRB is prohibited from approving an application if the applicant (and its depository institution affiliates) controls or would control (i) more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States, or (ii) 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank’s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not limit a state’s authority to restrict the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank or bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit. The federal banking agencies are also authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks has adopted a law opting out of the interstate mergers. Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above. North Carolina has enacted legislation permitting interstate banking acquisitions. Federal law authorizes the FDIC to approve interstate branching de novo by state banks only in states which specifically allow for such branching. The appropriate federal banking agencies adopted regulations which prohibit any out-of-state bank from using the interstate branching authority primarily for the purpose of deposit production. These regulations include guidelines to ensure that interstate branches operated by an out-of-state bank in a host state are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities which they serve. Dividends. The FRB has issued a joint interagency statement on the payment of cash dividends by banking organizations, which expresses the FRB’s view that in setting dividend levels, a banking organization should consider its ongoing earnings capacity, the adequacy of its loan loss allowance, and the overall effect that a dividend payout would have on its cost of funding, its capital position, and, consequently, its ability to serve the expected needs of creditworthy borrowers. Banking organizations should not maintain a level of cash dividends that is inconsistent with the organization's capital position, that could weaken the organization's overall financial health, or that could impair its ability to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers. Supervisors will continue to review the dividend policies of individual banking organizations and will take action when dividend policies are found to be inconsistent with sound capital and lending policies. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the FRB, the FRB may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized”. See “— Depository Institution Regulation — Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.” 30 Bank holding companies are required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the their consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order, directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with the FRB. Bank holding companies whose capital ratios exceeded the thresholds for well capitalized banks on a consolidated basis are exempt from the foregoing requirement if they were rated CAMELS 1 or 2 in their most recent regulatory inspection and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. Taxation – General The Company files its federal and state income tax returns based on a fiscal year ending December 31. Federal Income Taxation The Company reports income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards which require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary difference between financial statement and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has assessed if it had any significant uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2009 and determined there were none. Accordingly, no reserve for uncertain tax positions was recorded. The Company’s federal income tax returns have been audited through the year ended December 31, 2007. State Income Taxation Under North Carolina law, the corporate income tax currently is 6.90% of federal taxable income as computed under the Internal Revenue Code, subject to certain state adjustments. An annual state franchise tax is imposed at a rate of 0.15% applied to the greatest of the institution’s (i) capital stock, surplus and undivided profits, (ii) investment in tangible property in North Carolina or (iii) appraised valuation of property in North Carolina. For additional information regarding taxation, see Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2009 Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 hereto. Item 1A. Risk Factors Recent operating results may not be indicative of future operating results. The Company may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth and it may be difficult to replicate historical earnings growth. Consequently, historical results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of future operations. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations, and competition, may also impede the ability to expand market presence. If the Company experiences a significant decrease in the historical rate of growth, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected because a high percentage of operating costs are fixed expenses. Certain interest rate movements may impact earnings and asset value. Since December 31, 2008, the prime lending rate has remained at 3.25%, while the Federal Funds rate has held constant at 0.00% to 0.25%. Short-term and intermediate-term market interest rates are used as a guide to price the Bank’s loans and deposits. The decline in such interest rates has had a negative impact on the Bank’s interest rate spread and net interest margin, due to the interest sensitivity of the Bank’s interest-earning assets. With the Federal Reserve’s current policy of continuing to hold interest rates at historical low levels, it is not foreseeable that interest rates can decline farther. In this extraordinary interest rate environment, rates would be driven below zero if downward interest rate assumptions were made. Should short-term interest rates increase dramatically in the near future, and if rates on the Bank’s loans and investments reprice upwards faster than the rates on the Bank’s deposits and borrowings, the Bank could experience an increased interest rate spread and net interest margin, which could have a positive effect on the Bank’s profitability. 31 Changes in current interest rates also affect the value of the Bank’s interest-earning assets, and in particular the Bank’s securities portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders’ equity. Conversely, increases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from decreases in interest rates could have a positive effect on stockholders’ equity. Strong competition within the Bank’s market area could hurt profits and slow growth. The Bank faces intense competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits. This competition makes it more difficult for the Bank to originate new loans and at times has required the Bank to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits could result in the Bank earning less on loans and paying more on deposits, which could reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits, and to hire and retain experienced employees. Some of the institutions with which the Bank competes have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Bank has and may offer services that the Bank does not provide. Management expects competition to continue in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. The Bank’s profitability depends upon its continued ability to compete successfully in its market area. If the Bank experiences greater loan losses than anticipated, it will have an adverse effect on our net income. While the risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in banking, if the Bank experiences greater nonpayment levels than anticipated, earnings and overall financial condition, as well as the value of the Company’s common stock, could be adversely affected. There is no assurance that monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that the allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover actual losses. In addition, as a result of inherent risks in the loan portfolio, loan losses may be greater than management’s estimates of the appropriate level for the allowance. Loan losses can cause insolvency and failure of a financial institution and, in such an event, shareholders could lose their entire investment. In addition, future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect profitability. Loan losses will reduce the allowance for credit losses, and reduction in the allowance for credit losses could be restored by an increase in the provision for loan losses. This would reduce earnings which could have an adverse effect on the stock price. The Bank emphasizes commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer lending, which generally are riskier than residential mortgage lending. The Bank currently operates as a North Carolina chartered commercial bank. Prior to its conversion to a commercial bank in 1997, the Bank operated as a traditional savings and loan association, primarily emphasizing the origination of loans secured by single-family residences. Upon converting to a commercial bank, the Board of Directors determined there was a local demand for commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans. As a result, the Board of Directors determined to refocus the Bank’s strategy. Pursuant to this strategy, while continuing to pursue its existing business of originating single-family residential mortgage loans, the Bank has gradually expanded into commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer lending. In furtherance of this strategy, the Bank recruited experienced commercial real estate and consumer loan and consumer lending officers and developed commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loan products. As a result of these efforts over the years, at December 31, 2009, the Company had commercial real estate, commercial construction, commercial business and consumer loans totaling $419.0 million, $91.9 million, $26.1 million and $90.7 million, respectively, which represented 60.5%, 13.3%, 3.8% and 13.1%, respectively, of total loans. At December 31, 2009, $54.5 million, or 7.9% of total loans, consisted of residential real estate mortgage loans. While commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans are generally more interest rate sensitive and carry higher yields than do residential mortgage loans, they generally carry a higher degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risks as compared with single-family residential property lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. The payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the real estate project, retail establishment or business. These risks can be significantly affected by supply and demand conditions in the market for office, retail and residential space, and, as such, may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy generally. To minimize these risks, the Bank generally limits itself to its market area or to borrowers with which it has prior experience or who are otherwise known to the Bank. It has been the Bank’s policy to obtain annual financial statements of the business of the borrower or the project for which commercial real estate loans are made. In addition, in the case of commercial mortgage loans made to a partnership or a corporation, the Bank seeks, whenever possible, to obtain personal guarantees and annual financial statements of the principals of the partnership or corporation. 32 Commercial business loans are often larger and may involve greater risk than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation of the business involved, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. The Bank will seek to minimize these risks through its underwriting guidelines, which may require certain safeguards, such as the loan be supported by adequate cash flow of the borrower, profitability of the business, collateral and personal guarantees of the individual in the business. In addition, the Bank generally limits this type of lending to its market area and to borrowers with whom it has prior experience or who are otherwise well known to the Bank. Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and this is more likely to be adversely affected by events such as job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. See “Business of the Bank – Lending Activities – Consumer and Other Lending.” Weakness continues in the markets for residential or commercial real estate, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, could reduce the Company’s net income and profitability. Since 2007, the United States has experienced a continued softening in the residential housing markets, increasing delinquency and default rates. This has resulted in continued volatile and constrained secondary credit markets, which has resulted in a tightening of mortgage guidelines with our investors and mortgage guaranty insurance companies. The results have affected the mortgage industry in general by reducing mortgage credit for home buyers who otherwise may have qualified for a home loan prior to 2007. The Company’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in real estate values and tightening of credit guidelines in areas in which it operates. Decreases in real estate values in these areas could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans and investments. If poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, then the Company’s net income and profits may decrease. The declines in home prices in many markets across the United States, along with the reduced availability of mortgage credit, also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in the Bank’s portfolio of loans related to residential real estate construction and development. Further declines in home prices coupled with an economic recession and associated rises in unemployment levels could drive losses beyond that which are provided for in the allowance for loan losses. In that event, the Company’s earnings could be adversely affected. Additionally, continued weakness in the secondary market for residential lending could have an adverse impact upon the Company’s profitability. Significant ongoing disruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans have limited the market for and liquidity of most mortgage loans other than conforming Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae loans. The effects of ongoing mortgage market challenges, combined with the ongoing correction in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales, could result in further price reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans held, mortgage loan originations and gains on sale of mortgage loans. Continued declines in real estate values and home sales volumes, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses, or other factors, could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 33 Liquidity is essential to the Bank’s business and it relies, in part, on external funding sources to finance a portion of its operations. Liquidity is essential to the Bank’s business and could be negatively affected by the inability to access secured lending markets or raise funding in the long-term or short-term capital markets. Factors that cannot be controlled, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, could impair the ability to raise funding. In addition, the ability to raise funding could be impaired if the FHLB develops a negative perception of the Bank’s long-term or short-term financial prospects. Such negative perceptions could be developed due to a decline in the level of business activity, actions regulatory authorities might take, or the discovery of employee misconduct or illegal activity, among other things. If the Bank were unable to raise funds using the methods described above, it would likely need to liquidate unencumbered assets, such as the investment and loan portfolios, to meet maturing liabilities. The Bank may be unable to sell some of its assets, or may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect its operations. The capital and credit markets have experienced unprecedented levels of volatility. During 2008 and 2009, the capital and credit markets experienced extended volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. If these levels of market disruption and volatility continue, worsen or abate and then arise at a later date, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience an adverse effect on its ability to access capital, its business, its financial condition, and its results of operations. In response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets and the potential threats to the solvency of investment banks and other financial institutions, the United States government has taken unprecedented actions. These actions include the government-assisted acquisition of certain investment brokerage firms; the federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and the historic Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) authorizing the U.S. Treasury to invest in financial institutions and purchase mortgage loans and mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets or particular financial institutions. There can be no assurance as to when or if the government will further intervene in the financial sector and what impact government actions will have on the financial markets. Governmental intervention (or the lack thereof) could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. After careful review and consideration, the Company determined not to participate in the TARP program. The Company’s financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the economy in the Bank’s market area. The Bank’s market area consists of eastern, northeastern, southeastern and central North Carolina, where the Bank’s offices are located. As of December 31, 2009, management estimates that more than 95% of deposits and 90% of loans came from its primary market area. Because of the Bank’s concentration of business activities in its primary market area, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations depend upon economic conditions in its market area. The current economic environment has adversely affected real estate values, the volume of home sales, unemployment and other related economic conditions in the markets served by the Company and the Bank. The Company and the Bank operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Commissioner and the FDIC, as its primary federal regulator. The Company also is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and by the Commissioner. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of the Company’s common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on operations, the classification of the Bank’s assets and determination of the level of allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on operations. The Bank relies heavily on the services of key personnel. The Bank is a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. The Bank expects its future growth to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with its customers by the executive and other key officers. The unexpected loss of services of any executive and other key officers could have an adverse effect on operations and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings. 34 The Company’s common stock is not FDIC insured. The Company’s common stock is not a savings or deposit account or other obligation of the Bank and is not insured by the FDIC, the Deposit Insurance Fund or any other governmental agency and is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal. Provisions in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and statutory provisions could discourage a hostile acquisition of control. The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain certain provisions that could discourage non-negotiated takeover attempts that certain stockholders might deem to be in their interests or through which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price and that may tend to perpetuate existing management. These provisions include: the classification of the terms of the members of the Board of Directors; supermajority provisions for the approval of certain business combinations; elimination of cumulative voting by stockholders in the election of directors; certain provisions relating to meetings of stockholders; restrictions on the acquisition of the Company’s equity securities; and provisions allowing the Board of Directors to consider non-monetary factors in evaluating a business combination or a tender or exchange offer. The provisions in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation requiring a supermajority vote for the approval of certain business combinations and containing restrictions on acquisitions of the Company’s equity securities provide that the supermajority voting requirements or acquisition restrictions do not apply to business combinations or acquisitions meeting specified Board of Directors approval requirements. The Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock as well as additional shares of Common Stock up to a total of 25,000,000 outstanding shares. These shares could be issued without stockholder approval on terms or in circumstances that could deter a future takeover attempt. In addition, Virginia law provides for certain restrictions an acquisition of the Company, and federal and North Carolina laws contain various restrictions on acquisitions of control of banks and their holding companies. The Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and statutory provisions, as well as certain other provisions of state and federal law and certain provisions in the Company’s and the Bank’s employee benefit plans, employment agreements and change in control severance agreements, may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a future takeover attempt in which stockholders of the Company otherwise might receive a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. The Company has received no written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2009 fiscal year and that remain unresolved. 35 Item
