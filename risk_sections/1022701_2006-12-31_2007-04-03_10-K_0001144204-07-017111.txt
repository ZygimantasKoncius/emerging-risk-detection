ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to NeoMedia’s Business NeoMedia Has Historically Lost Money And Losses May Continue NeoMedia has incurred substantial operating losses since inception, and could continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. NeoMedia reported net losses of $67,438,000, $9,147,000 and $7,230,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NeoMedia’s accumulated losses were $159,962,000 and $92,524,000 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, NeoMedia had a working capital deficit of $81,167,000 and $2,065,000, respectively. NeoMedia had stockholders’ equity/(deficit) of $(54,534,000) and $4,227,000 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. NeoMedia generated revenues from continuing operations of $10,309,000, $877,000, and $973,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, NeoMedia recorded negative cash flows from continuing operations of $9,958,000, $4,883,000, and $3,937,000, respectively. To succeed, NeoMedia must develop new client and customer relationships and substantially increase its revenue derived from improved products and additional value-added services. NeoMedia has expended, and to the extent it has available financing, NeoMedia intends to continue to expend, substantial resources to develop and improve its products, increase its value-added services and to market its products and services. These development and marketing expenses must be incurred well in advance of the recognition of revenue. As a result, NeoMedia may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. NeoMedia’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Have Added Going Concern Language To Their Report On NeoMedia’s Consolidated Financial Statements, Which Means That NeoMedia May Not Be Able To Continue Operations The report of Stonefield Josephson, Inc., NeoMedia’s independent registered public accounting firm, with respect to NeoMedia’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, indicates that, at the date of their report, NeoMedia had suffered significant recurring losses from operations and its working capital deficit raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. NeoMedia’s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty. NeoMedia Will Need to Raise Additional Funds to Continue Its Operations NeoMedia had cash balances of $3,606,000 as of December 31, 2006. Additionally, during March 2007 NeoMedia sold convertible debentures resulting in net funding to the Company of $5,000,000. NeoMedia could receive additional cash at future dates as from the following sources: (i) sale of non-core business units NeoMedia Micro Paint Repair, 12Snap, and NeoMedia Telecom Services, (ii) from the exercise of stock options, to the extent that the exercise price of such stock options is less than the market price of NeoMedia’s common stock, and (iii) from the exercise of stock warrants, to the extent that the warrants become registered for resale and the exercise price of such stock warrants is less than the market price of NeoMedia’s common stock at the time of exercise, and to the extent that the holder of such warrants does not elect to perform a “cashless” exercise, in which case NeoMedia would not receive any cash proceeds from the exercise. However, none of these events is contractually obligated. In order to satisfy its obligations that are currently due and that will come due, and maintain its operations in the absence of a material increase in revenues, NeoMedia will need to either generate from the sale of its non-core businesses, or raise additional cash from outside sources. The most likely source of cash in the short term is from the sale of the 12Snap and/or Micro Paint Repair business unit. 16 In the event that (i) NeoMedia is unsuccessful in divesting of its non-core business units in a timely fashion, (ii) NeoMedia’s stock price does not increase to levels where it can force exercise of enough of its outstanding warrants to generate material operating capital, (iii) the market for NeoMedia’s stock will not support the sale of shares underlying such warrants or other funding sources, or (iv) NeoMedia does not realize a material increase in revenue during the next 12 months, NeoMedia will have to seek additional cash sources. There can be no assurances that such funding sources will be available. If necessary funds are not available, NeoMedia’s business and operations would be materially adversely affected and in such event, NeoMedia would be forced to attempt to reduce costs and adjust its business plan, and could be forced to sell certain of its assets, including its remaining subsidiaries. NeoMedia Has Material Weaknesses in Its Internal Control over Financial Reporting that May Prevent The Company from Being Able to Accurately Report Its Financial Results or Prevent Fraud, which Could Harm Its Business and Operating Results. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and prevent fraud. In addition, Section 404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that NeoMedia assess, and its independent registered public accounting firm attest to, the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. If NeoMedia cannot provide reliable and accurate financial reports and prevent fraud, its business and operating results could be harmed. NeoMedia has in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of its internal controls that need improvement. NeoMedia has identified six material weaknesses in its internal control as of December 31, 2006. These matters and NeoMedia’s efforts regarding remediation of these matters, as well as efforts regarding internal controls generally are discussed in detail in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, as NeoMedia’s material weaknesses in its internal controls demonstrates, NeoMedia cannot be certain that the remedial measures its has taken to date will ensure that NeoMedia designs, implements, and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future. Additionally, since the requirements of Section 404 are ongoing and apply for future years, NeoMedia cannot be certain that it or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify additional deficiencies or material weaknesses in its internal controls in the future, in addition to those identified as of December 31, 2006. Remedying the material weaknesses that have been presently identified, and any additional deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that NeoMedia or its independent registered public accounting firm may identify in the future, could in the future require NeoMedia to incur significant costs, hire additional personnel, expend significant time and management resources or make other changes. Any delay or failure to design and implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation, could harm our operating results, cause NeoMedia to fail to meet its financial reporting obligations, or prevent NeoMedia from providing reliable and accurate financial reports or avoiding or detecting fraud. Disclosure of NeoMedia’s material weaknesses, any failure to remediate such material weaknesses in a timely fashion or having or maintaining ineffective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of NeoMedia stock and its access to capital. NeoMedia Has Guaranteed The Value Of Stock Issued In Connection With Recent Mergers Through The Registration Of The Shares, Which Could Result In A Material Cash Liability Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreements with Gavitec and 12Snap, in the event that NeoMedia’s stock price at the time the consideration shares issued in connection with each acquisition are saleable (either upon effectiveness of a registration statement containing the shares, or under Rule 144) is less than the price at which they were valued for purposes of the merger agreement ($0.389 per share with respect to Gavitec and $0.3956 per share with respect to 12Snap), NeoMedia is obligated to compensate the sellers in cash for the difference between the price at the time the shares become saleable and the price the shares were valued for purposes of the merger agreement. 17 On January 23, 2007, NeoMedia reached an agreement with the former shareholders of Gavitec, pursuant to which the parties agreed that the entire purchase price obligation would be satisfied through the payment by NeoMedia of (i) $1,800,000 in cash, payable no later than February 28, 2007 (subsequently extended to March 31, 2007), and (ii) 61,000,000 shares of NeoMedia common stock, to be issued no later than February 28, 2007. The Amendment Agreement stipulates that, in the event that the 61,000,000 shares are not registered for resale by August 31, 2007, interest shall accrue at a rate of 8% per annum on the agreed value of the shares of $1,900,000. NeoMedia also agreed to pay interest accrued on the purchase price in the amount of $213,000 and reimburse $100,000 of costs related to the acquisition to the primary former shareholder of Gavitec no later than February 28, 2007. NeoMedia issued the shares and made cash payments of $2,113,000 during March 2007 in satisfaction of the obligation. During the first quarter of 2007, NeoMedia issued 197,620,948 shares of its common stock in satisfaction of $9,427,000 of the total $16,233,000 12Snap purchase price guarantee amount. The remaining balance on the purchase price obligation after this payment was $6,806,000. The Company is currently negotiating payment terms for the balance of the obligation. All Of The Company’s Assets Are Pledged To Secure Certain Debt Obligations, Which The Company Could Fail To Repay Pursuant to secured convertible debentures, dated as of March 27, 2007, August 24, 2006 and December 29, 2006, in the principal amount of $7,459,000, $5,000,000 and $2,500,000, respectively, issued to Cornell Capital Partners, LP, the Company was required to secure such secured convertible debentures’ repayment with substantially all of its assets. In the event the Company is unable to repay the secured convertible debentures, it could lose all of its assets and be forced to cease its operations. If the Company is found to be in default under the debentures, the full principal amount of the debentures, together with interest and other amounts owing, may become immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was in default of a covenant contained in the financing agreements due to the Company’s pending registration statement to register the underlying shares of the convertible instruments not becoming effective by the specified date. NeoMedia is also in default of Series C convertible preferred stock with a face value of $22,000,000. As a result of the default, the holder of the securities could redeem the convertible debentures and preferred stock for cash at their discretion. Additionally, as a result of the default, Cornell Capital Partners currently has the right to exercise on a cashless basis 250,000,000 of the warrants they hold, and NeoMedia may not receive any cash proceeds from such exercises. 18 NeoMedia Has Contractual Commitments To Pay Silent Partners Resulting from the acquisition of 12 Snap, NeoMedia has a commitment to pay approximately $1 million of remaining obligations to Silent Partners of 12Snap that come due by March 31, 2007, which have not been paid as of the date of this filing. If NeoMedia’s financial resources are insufficient, or if NeoMedia is unable to negotiate a payment plan, NeoMedia may require additional financing in order to meet this obligation. There is no guarantee that NeoMedia will be able to obtain the necessary additional capital to meet this obligation on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In any of these events, NeoMedia may be unable to repay this obligation when it becomes due. There Is Limited Information Upon Which Investors Can Evaluate NeoMedia’s Business Because The Physical-World-To-Internet Market Has Existed For Only A Short Period Of Time The physical-world-to-Internet market in which NeoMedia operates is a recently developed market. Further, NeoMedia has conducted operations in this market only since March 1996. Consequently, NeoMedia has a relatively limited operating history upon which an investor may base an evaluation of NeoMedia’s primary business and determine NeoMedia’s prospects for achieving its intended business objectives. To date, NeoMedia has had limited sales of its physical-world-to-Internet products. NeoMedia is prone to all of the risks inherent to the establishment of any new business venture, including unforeseen changes in its business plan. An investor should consider the likelihood of NeoMedia’s future success to be highly speculative in light of its limited operating history in its primary market, as well as the limited resources, problems, expenses, risks, and complications frequently encountered by similarly situated companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, such as the physical-world-to-Internet space. To address these risks, NeoMedia must, among other things: · maintain and increase its client base; · implement and successfully execute its business and marketing strategy; · continue to develop and upgrade its products; · continually update and improve service offerings and features; · respond to industry and competitive developments; and · attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. NeoMedia may not be successful in addressing these risks. If NeoMedia is unable to do so, its business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. NeoMedia’s Future Success Depends On The Timely Introduction Of New Products And The Acceptance Of These New Products In The Marketplace. Rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions are typical for the markets NeoMedia serves. NeoMedia’s future success will depend in large part on continuous, timely development and introduction of new products that address evolving market requirements. To the extent that NeoMedia fails to introduce new and innovative products, it may lose market share to its competitors, which may be difficult to regain. Any inability, for technological or other reasons, to successfully develop and introduce new products could materially and adversely affect NeoMedia’s business. 19 NeoMedia’s Common Stock Is Deemed To Be “Penny Stock,” Which May Make It More Difficult For Investors To Sell Their Shares Due To Suitability Requirements NeoMedia’s common stock is deemed to be “penny stock” as that term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These requirements may reduce the potential market for NeoMedia’s common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in NeoMedia’s common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. This could cause NeoMedia’s stock price to decline. Penny stocks are stock: · with a price of less than $5.00 per share; · that are not traded on a “recognized” national exchange; · whose prices are not quoted on the NASDAQ automated quotation system (NASDAQ listed stock must still have a price of not less than $5.00 per share); or · in issuers with net tangible assets less than $2 million (if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years) or $10 million (if in continuous operation for less than three years), or with average revenues of less than $6 million for the last three years. Broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks. Moreover, broker-dealers are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor. Existing Shareholders Will Experience Significant Dilution When Certain Investors Convert Their Preferred Stock to Common Stock, Convert Outstanding Convertible Debentures, Or When the Investors Exercise Their Warrants and Receive Common Stock Shares Under The Investment Agreement With The Investors The issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of Series C convertible preferred stock, the conversion of convertible debentures, or the exercise of warrants pursuant to NeoMedia’s transactions with Cornell Capital Partners will have a dilutive impact on NeoMedia’s stockholders. As a result, NeoMedia’s net income or loss per share could decrease in future periods, and the market price of its common stock could decline. In addition, the lower NeoMedia’s stock price is, the more shares of common stock NeoMedia will have to issue pursuant to the conversion of preferred stock or the convertible debentures. If NeoMedia’s stock price is lower, then existing stockholders would experience greater dilution. Due To The Accounting Treatment Of Certain Convertible Preferred Stock And Convertible Debenture Instruments Issued By NeoMedia, A Fluctuation In NeoMedia’s Stock Price Could Have A Material Impact On NeoMedia’s Results Of Operations During the year ended December 31, 2006, NeoMedia recognized income in the amount of $13,645,000 resulting from adjustments recorded to reflect the change in fair value from revaluation of warrants and embedded conversion features in connection with its Series C convertible preferred shares and its convertible debentures. NeoMedia will adjust the carrying value of its derivative instruments to market at each balance sheet date. As a result, NeoMedia could experience significant fluctuations in its net income (loss) in future periods from such charges based on corresponding movement in NeoMedia’s share price. 20 NeoMedia Is Uncertain Of The Success Of Its NeoMedia Mobile Business Unit And The Failure Of This Unit Would Negatively Affect The Price Of NeoMedia’s Stock NeoMedia provides products and services that provide a link from physical objects, including printed material, to the mobile Internet. NeoMedia can provide no assurance that: · its NeoMedia Mobile business unit will ever achieve profitability; · its current product offerings will not be adversely affected by the focusing of its resources on the physical-world-to-Internet space; or · the products NeoMedia develops will obtain market acceptance. In the event that the NeoMedia Mobile business unit should never achieve profitability, that NeoMedia’s current product offerings should so suffer, or that NeoMedia’s products fail to obtain market acceptance, NeoMedia’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. A Large Percentage Of NeoMedia’s Assets Are Intangible Assets, Which Will Have Little Or No Value If NeoMedia’s Operations Are Unsuccessful At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately 57% and 39%, respectively, of NeoMedia’s total assets used in continuing operations were intangible assets and goodwill, consisting primarily of rights related to NeoMedia’s patents, other intellectual property, and excess of purchase price over fair market value paid for Gavitec, 12Snap, and BSD. If NeoMedia’s operations are unsuccessful, these assets will have little or no value, which would materially adversely affect the value of NeoMedia’s stock and the ability of NeoMedia’s stockholders to recoup their investments in NeoMedia’s capital stock. NeoMedia reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. NeoMedia may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of NeoMedia’s goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, resulting in an impact on results of operations. Certain Of NeoMedia’s Emerging Products And Services Have Limited History And May Not Result In Success To date, NeoMedia has conducted limited marketing efforts directly relating to its emerging technology products, consisting primarily of the qode® suite of products, and certain products of recent acquisition of Gavitec. Many of NeoMedia’s marketing efforts with respect to these emerging technologies have been largely untested in the marketplace, and may not result in materially increased sales of these emerging products and services. To penetrate the emerging markets in which it competes, NeoMedia expects that it will have to exert significant efforts to create awareness of, and demand for, its emerging products and services. To the extent funding is available, NeoMedia intends to continue to expand its sales and marketing resources as the market continues to mature. NeoMedia’s failure to further develop its sales and marketing capabilities and successfully market its emerging products and services would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 21 NeoMedia’s Internally Developed Systems Are Inefficient And May Put NeoMedia At A Competitive Disadvantage NeoMedia uses internally developed technologies for a portion of its systems integration services, as well as the technologies required to interconnect its clients’ and customers’ physical-world-to-Internet systems and hardware with its own. As NeoMedia develops these systems in order to integrate disparate systems and hardware on a case-by-case basis, these systems are inefficient and require a significant amount of customization. Such client and customer-specific customization is time consuming and costly and may place NeoMedia at a competitive disadvantage when compared to competitors with more efficient systems. NeoMedia Could Fail To Attract Or Retain Key Personnel NeoMedia’s future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract, train, and retain additional highly skilled executive level management, creative, technical, and sales personnel. Competition is intense for these types of personnel from other technology companies and more established organizations, many of which have significantly larger operations and greater financial, marketing, human, and other resources than NeoMedia has. NeoMedia may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. NeoMedia’s failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. NeoMedia Depends Upon Its Senior Management And Their Loss Or Unavailability Could Put NeoMedia At A Competitive Disadvantage NeoMedia’s success depends largely on the skills of certain key management and technical personnel, including Charles W. Fritz, NeoMedia’s founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors and the interim Chief Executive Officer, David A. Dodge, NeoMedia’s Chief Financial Officer, Roger M. Pavane, NeoMedia's senior vice president of sales and marketing and head of NeoMedia’s mobile division in the Americas, and Dr. Christian Steinborn, managing director of NeoMedia's Gavitec AG - mobile digit subsidiary in Germany and head of NeoMedia’s mobile division in Europe and Asia. The loss of the services of these individuals could materially harm NeoMedia’s business because of the cost and time necessary to replace and train a replacement. Such a loss would also divert management attention away from operational issues. NeoMedia does not presently maintain a key-man life insurance policy on any of these key individuals. During December 2006, Charles T. Jensen, NeoMedia’s former President and Chief Executive Officer, Martin N. Copus, NeoMedia’s former Chief Operating Officer and the head of its NeoMedia Mobile business unit, and William E. Fritz, outside director, each resigned their positions. NeoMedia May Be Unsuccessful In Integrating Its Gavitec Acquisition With Its Current Business The success of the acquisition of Gavitec could depend on the ability of NeoMedia’s executive management to integrate the business plan of Gavitec with NeoMedia’s overall business plan. Failure to properly integrate the business could have a material adverse effect on the expected revenue and operations of the acquisition, as well as the expected return on investment for NeoMedia. During the first quarter of 2006, NeoMedia acquired two businesses, Mobot and Sponge, each of which was divested during the fourth quarter of 2006, less than one year after acquisition. In addition, during February 2007 NeoMedia decided to attempt to sell its wholly owned subsidiaries 12Snap and NeoMedia Telecom Services, both of which were acquired during the first quarter of 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, 12Snap and NeoMedia Telecom Services accounted for approximately 91% of NeoMedia’s consolidated revenues, and approximately 5% of NeoMedia’s consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, assets of 12Snap and NeoMedia Telecom Services represented approximately 44% of NeoMedia’s consolidated assets as of December 31, 2006. NeoMedia expects to experience a decrease in revenues and operating losses during 2007 relative to 2006 as a result of these actual and anticipated divestitures. 22 NeoMedia May Be Unable To Protect Its Intellectual Property Rights And May Be Liable For Infringing The Intellectual Property Rights Of Others NeoMedia’s success in the physical-world-to-Internet market is dependent upon its proprietary technology, including patents and other intellectual property, and on the ability to protect proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. In addition, NeoMedia must conduct its operations without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. NeoMedia also intends to rely upon unpatented trade secrets and the know-how and expertise of its employees, as well as its patents. To protect its proprietary technology and other intellectual property, NeoMedia relies primarily on a combination of the protections provided by applicable patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws as well as on confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements. Although NeoMedia believes that it has taken appropriate steps to protect its unpatented proprietary rights, including requiring that its employees and third parties who are granted access to NeoMedia’s proprietary technology enter into confidentiality agreements, NeoMedia can provide no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to protect its rights against third parties. Others may independently develop or otherwise acquire patented or unpatented technologies or products similar or superior to NeoMedia’s. NeoMedia licenses from third parties certain software tools that are included in NeoMedia’s services and products. If any of these licenses were terminated, NeoMedia could be required to seek licenses for similar software from other third parties or develop these tools internally. NeoMedia may not be able to obtain such licenses or develop such tools in a timely fashion, on acceptable terms, or at all. Companies participating in the software and Internet technology industries are frequently involved in disputes relating to intellectual property. NeoMedia may in the future be required to defend its intellectual property rights against infringement, duplication, discovery, and misappropriation by third parties or to defend against third party claims of infringement. Likewise, disputes may arise in the future with respect to ownership of technology developed by employees who were previously employed by other companies. Any such litigation or disputes could result in substantial costs to, and a diversion of effort by, NeoMedia. An adverse determination could subject NeoMedia to significant liabilities to third parties, require NeoMedia to seek licenses from, or pay royalties to, third parties, or require NeoMedia to develop appropriate alternative technology. Some or all of these licenses may not be available to NeoMedia on acceptable terms or at all, and NeoMedia may be unable to develop alternate technology at an acceptable price or at all. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on NeoMedia’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. NeoMedia Is Exposed To Product Liability Claims And An Uninsured Claim Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On NeoMedia’s Business, Prospects, Financial Condition, And Results Of Operations, As Well As The Value Of NeoMedia’s Stock Many of NeoMedia’s projects are critical to the operations of its clients’ businesses. Any failure in a client’s information system could result in a claim for substantial damages against NeoMedia, regardless of NeoMedia’s responsibility for such failure. NeoMedia could, therefore, be subject to claims in connection with the products and services that it sells. NeoMedia currently maintains product liability insurance. There can be no assurance that: 23 · NeoMedia has contractually limited its liability for such claims adequately or at all; or · NeoMedia would have sufficient resources to satisfy any liability resulting from any such claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against NeoMedia could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. NeoMedia Will Not Pay Cash Dividends And Investors May Have To Sell Their Shares In Order To Realize Their Investment NeoMedia has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. NeoMedia intends to retain future earnings, if any, for reinvestment in the development and marketing of NeoMedia’s products and services. As a result, investors may have to sell their shares of common stock to realize their investment. Some Provisions Of NeoMedia’s Certificate of Incorporation And bylaws May Deter Takeover Attempts, Which May Limit The Opportunity Of NeoMedia’s Stockholders To Sell Their Shares At A Premium To The Then-Current Market Price Some of the provisions of NeoMedia’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire NeoMedia, even if doing so might be beneficial to NeoMedia’s stockholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium to the then-current market price. On December 10, 1999, NeoMedia’s Board of Directors adopted a stockholders rights plan and declared a non-taxable dividend of one right to acquire Series A Preferred Stock of NeoMedia, par value $0.01 per share, on each outstanding share of NeoMedia’s common stock to stockholders of record on December 10, 1999 and each share of common stock issued thereafter until a pre-defined hostile takeover date. The stockholder rights plan was adopted as an anti-takeover measure, commonly referred to as a “poison pill.” The stockholder rights plan was designed to enable all stockholders not engaged in a hostile takeover attempt to receive fair and equal treatment in any proposed takeover of NeoMedia and to guard against partial or two-tiered tender offers, open market accumulations, and other hostile tactics to gain control of NeoMedia. The stockholders rights plan was not adopted in response to any effort to acquire control of NeoMedia at the time of adoption. This stockholders rights plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, discouraging, preventing, or rendering more costly an acquisition of NeoMedia or a change in control of NeoMedia. Certain of NeoMedia’s directors, officers and principal stockholders, Charles W. Fritz, William E. Fritz and The Fritz Family Limited Partnership and their holdings were exempted from the triggering provisions of NeoMedia’s “poison pill” plan, as a result of the fact that, as of the plan’s adoption, their holdings might have otherwise triggered the “poison pill”. In addition, NeoMedia’s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to designate and issue preferred stock, in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board of Directors, without further action by stockholders, and may include voting rights, including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion, redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions. 24 NeoMedia is authorized to issue a total of 25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share. The issuance of any preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the rights of holders of NeoMedia’s common stock, and, therefore, could reduce the value of shares of NeoMedia’s common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict NeoMedia’s ability to merge with, or sell NeoMedia’s assets to, a third party. The ability of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, discouraging, preventing, or rendering more costly an acquisition of NeoMedia or a change in NeoMedia’s control. 25 Risks Relating To NeoMedia’s Industry The Security Of The Internet Poses Risks To The Success Of NeoMedia’s Entire Business Concerns over the security of the Internet and other electronic transactions, and the privacy of consumers and merchants, may inhibit the growth of the Internet and other online services generally, especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions, which may have a material adverse effect on NeoMedia’s physical-world-to-Internet business. NeoMedia Will Only Be Able To Execute Its Physical-World-To-Internet Business Plan If Internet Usage and Electronic Commerce Continue To Grow NeoMedia’s future revenues and any future profits are substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of the Internet and camera devices on mobile telephones. If use of the Internet and camera devices on mobile telephones does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected, or if the infrastructure for the Internet and camera devices on mobile telephones does not effectively support the growth that may occur, or does not become a viable commercial marketplace, NeoMedia’s physical-world-to-Internet business, and therefore NeoMedia’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. Rapid growth in the use of, and interest in, the Internet and camera devices on mobile telephones is a recent phenomenon, and may not continue on a lasting basis. In addition, customers may not adopt, and continue to use mobile telephones as a medium of information retrieval or commerce. Demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the mobile Internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty, and few services and products have generated profits. For NeoMedia to be successful, consumers and businesses must be willing to accept and use novel and cost efficient ways of conducting business and exchanging information. In addition, the public in general may not accept the use of the Internet and camera devices on mobile telephones as a viable commercial or information marketplace for a number of reasons, including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements. To the extent that mobile phone Internet usage continues to experience significant growth in the number of users, their frequency of use, or in their bandwidth requirements, the infrastructure for the mobile Internet may be unable to support the demands placed upon them. In addition, the mobile Internet and mobile interactivity could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of mobile Internet activity, or due to increased governmental regulation. Significant issues concerning the commercial and informational use of the mobile Internet, and online networks technologies, including security, reliability, cost, ease of use, and quality of service, remain unresolved and may inhibit the growth of Internet business solutions that utilize these technologies. Changes in, or insufficient availability of, telecommunications services to support the Internet, the Web or other online services also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the Internet, the Web and other online networks generally and NeoMedia’s physical-world-to-Internet product and networks in particular. 26 NeoMedia May Not Be Able To Adapt As The Internet, Physical-World-To-Internet, And Customer Demands Continue To Evolve NeoMedia may not be able to adapt as the mobile Internet and physical-world-to-Internet markets and consumer demands continue to evolve. NeoMedia’s failure to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The mobile Internet and physical-world-to-Internet markets are characterized by: · rapid technological change; · changes in user and customer requirements and preferences; · frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies; and · the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render proprietary technology and hardware and software infrastructure obsolete. NeoMedia’s success will depend, in part, on its ability to: · enhance and improve the responsiveness and functionality of its products and services; · license or develop technologies useful in its business on a timely basis; · enhance its existing services, and develop new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of NeoMedia’s prospective or current customers; and · respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. NeoMedia May Not Be Able To Compete Effectively In Markets Where Its Competitors Have More Resources While the market for physical-world-to-Internet technology is relatively new, it is already highly competitive and characterized by an increasing number of entrants that have introduced or developed products and services similar to those offered by NeoMedia. NeoMedia believes that competition will intensify and increase in the near future. NeoMedia’s target market is rapidly evolving and is subject to continuous technological change. As a result, NeoMedia’s competitors may be better positioned to address these developments or may react more favorably to these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on NeoMedia’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. Some of NeoMedia’s competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with clients, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than NeoMedia. NeoMedia may not successfully compete in any market in which it conducts or may conduct operations. NeoMedia may not be able to penetrate markets or market its products as effectively as NeoMedia’s better-funded more-established competitors. 27 In The Future There Could Be Government Regulations And Legal Uncertainties Which Could Harm NeoMedia’s Business Any new legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to NeoMedia’s business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and other online services, could have a material adverse effect on NeoMedia’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, the Web and other online services, federal, state, and local governments may adopt laws and regulations, or amend existing laws and regulations, with respect to the Internet or other online services covering issues such as taxation, user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, and characteristics and quality of products and services. The growth and development of the market for electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws to impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the Internet, the Web or other online services, which could, in turn, decrease the demand for NeoMedia’s services and increase NeoMedia’s cost of doing business, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on NeoMedia’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, the relevant governmental authorities have not resolved the applicability to the Internet, the Web and other online services of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership and personal privacy and it may take time to resolve these issues definitively. Certain of NeoMedia’s proprietary technology allows for the storage of demographic data from NeoMedia’s users. In 2000, the European Union adopted a directive addressing data privacy that may limit the collection and use of certain information regarding Internet users. This directive may limit NeoMedia’s ability to collect and use information collected by NeoMedia’s technology in certain European countries. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and several state governments have investigated the use by certain Internet companies of personal information. NeoMedia could incur significant additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if NeoMedia’s privacy practices are investigated. 28 ITEM 1B.
