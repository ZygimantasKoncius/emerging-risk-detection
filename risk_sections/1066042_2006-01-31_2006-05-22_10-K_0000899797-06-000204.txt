ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are certain risk factors and uncertainties which Dectron faces: UNCERTAINTY OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE. The business segments in which Dectron competes are extremely competitive. Although Dectron seeks to establish its products as the preferred solution for IAQ problems, demand and market acceptance for newly introduced products and services is subject to a high level of uncertainty. Dectron has not yet commenced significant marketing activities relating to its new product lines such as its moisture recovery systems. Potential customers may elect to utilize other products which they believe to be more efficient or have other advantages over Dectrons products, or may otherwise be reluctant to purchase Dectrons products. Achieving market acceptance for Dectrons products will require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by potential consumers as to the perceived benefits and distinctive characteristics of D ectrons products. There can be no assurance that Dectron will have available resources necessary to achieve such acceptance. CYCLICAL DEMAND. The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. The markets we serve are sensitive to fluctuations in general business cycles and domestic and foreign economic conditions and events. For example, demand for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment and product innovations. A reduction in these factors would reduce orders for our products and reduce our sales. COMPETITION. The industries in which Dectron competes are all highly competitive. Dectron competes against a number of local, regional and national manufacturers in each of its business segments, many of which have been in existence longer than Dectron and some of which have substantially greater financial resources than Dectron. Dectron believes that competition from new entrants, especially in the IAQ markets will come, if at all, from large corporations which may be able to compete with Dectron on the basis of price and as a result may have a material adverse affect on the results of operations of Dectron. In addition, there can be no assurance that other companies will not develop new or enhanced products that are either more effective than Dectrons or would render Dectrons products non-competitive or obsolete. DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL. Dectron is highly dependent on the experience of its management and key personnel in the continuing development of its retail operations. The loss of the services of certain of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business. Dectrons future success will depend in part on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to manage the development and future growth of Dectron. There can be no assurance that it will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The failure to recruit additional key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Dectrons business, financial condition and results of operations. 4 CONTINUED CONTROL BY MANAGEMENT. Management of Dectron beneficially owns approximately 60% of Dectrons outstanding Common Shares. Dectrons stockholders do not have the right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Accordingly, present stockholders will be in a position to exert control over the business and operations of Dectron, including the election of all directors of Dectron. DEPENDENCE UPON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS. Although Dectron is not dependent on any one supplier, it is dependent on the ability of its third-party suppliers to supply Dectrons raw materials as well as certain specific component parts. Failure by Dectrons third-party suppliers to meet Dectrons requirements could have a material adverse effect on Dectron. There can be no assurance that Dectrons third-party suppliers will dedicate sufficient resources to meet Dectrons scheduled delivery requirements or that Dectrons suppliers will have sufficient resources to satisfy Dectrons requirements during any period of sustained demand. Failure of manufacturers or suppliers to supply, or delays in supplying, Dectron with raw materials or certain components, or allocations in the supply of certain high demand raw components could materially adversely affect Dectrons operations and ability to meet its own delivery schedules on a timely and competitive basis. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. Dectron holds six United States patents and two Canadian patents. The patents expire between 2007 and 2015. The patents relate to swimming pool dehumidifiers, to the method and apparatus for controlling heat rejection in refrigeration systems and to the extraction of moisture from air. Dectron may apply for additional patents relating to other aspects of its products. There can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection which existing or future patents or trademarks, if any, may afford Dectron, that any patent or trademark applications will result in issued patents or trademarks, that Dectrons patents or trademarks will be upheld, if challenged, or that competitors will not develop similar or superior methods or products outside the protection of any patent issued to Dectron. Although Dectron believes that its patents, trademarks and prod ucts do not and will not infringe patents or trademarks or violate the proprietary rights of others, it is possible that Dectrons existing patent or trademark rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents, trademarks or proprietary rights may occur. In the event Dectrons products infringe patents or proprietary rights of others, Dectron may be required to modify the design of its products, change the name of its products or obtain a license for certain technology. There can be no assurance that Dectron will be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions or at all. Failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon Dectron. In addition, there can be no assurance that Dectron will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent or trademark infringement or proprietary rights violation action which may be brought against it. Moreover, if Dectrons product s infringe patents, trademarks or proprietary rights of others, Dectron could, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which also could have a material adverse effect on Dectron. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political risks and adverse changes in local legal, tax and regulatory schemes. In 2006, almost 48% of our consolidated revenue was from customers outside of our home market of Canada. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of Canada. Such risks include, without limitation, the following: • the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations; • potential negative consequences from changes to significant taxation policies, laws or regulations; • changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements; and • political or economic instability, insurrection, civil disturbance or war. NATURAL DISASTER. Our facilities could be damaged by catastrophes which could reduce our production capacity and result in a loss of customers. We conduct our operations in facilities located throughout North America. Any of these facilities could be damaged by fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunication and information systems failure or similar events. Although we carry property insurance, including business interruption insurance, our inability to meet customers' schedules as a result of catastrophe may result in a loss of customers or significant additional costs such as penalty claims under customer contracts. CURRENCY AND COMMIDITY FLUCTUATIONS. Fluctuations in exchange rates between Canadian and United States dollars may have a material adverse effect upon Dectrons results of operations. Similarly fluctuations in the price of certain commodity metals could adversely affect future results. The impact of future exchange rate or commodity price fluctuations on Dectrons results of operations cannot be accurately predicted. To date, Dectron has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuation in exchange rates and does not have a policy relating to hedging. There can be no assurance that any hedging techniques that might be implemented by Dectron in the future would be successful or that Dectrons results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate or commodity price fluctuations. 5
