Risk Factors of this report. Our internal risk management and control systems make use of various measures including: · Annual strategic evaluations of our business; · Periodic operational review meetings of the Management Board with the Management Committee; · Quarterly financial planning meetings of the Management Board with the Supervisory Board; · A planning and control cycle consisting of annual, quarterly and monthly procedures, including subsequent follow-up on achievements of targets set; · Advice of Crucells Disclosure Committee to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer with respect to the timely review, disclosure and evaluation of periodical (financial) reports as well as with respect to the maintenance and evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures; · Letters of representation that are signed by selected key-management members on a quarterly basis in which they confirm that for their area of responsibility based upon their knowledge: - An effective system of internal controls and procedures is maintained; and - The financial reports fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows; · Management letters and audit reports provided by our external auditor; · Crucells standardized and formalized working practices, including the Biological Safety Manual which was developed in-house to meet the specific needs of Crucells working environment; and · The Code of Conduct of Crucell. The Management Board has discussed the internal risk management and control system with the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. As a result of its listing at NASDAQ, Crucell is also obliged to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations (Section 114 Management Report Corporate Governance 404). Section 404 addresses the responsibility of the Management Board for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our public financial reporting. Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures We have evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2008. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2008 were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the US. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: · Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; · Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only by authorized employees in accordance with documented authorizations; and · Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment and those criteria, Management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. Deloitte Accountants B.V., the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 as stated in their report beginning on page 116 of this report. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There has not been any change in the internal controls over financial reporting of the Company that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal controls over financial reporting. 115 Management Report Corporate Governance Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Supervisory Board and Shareholders of Crucell N.V. Leiden, the Netherlands We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Crucell N.V. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the acCompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Company and our report dated April 21, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the adoption of IFRIC 14 by the Company. Deloitte Accountants B.V. Amsterdam, The Netherlands April 21, 2009 116 Management Report Corporate Governance Articles of Association and Share Capital Memorandum and Articles of Association Set out below is a summary of material information concerning our shares, which are our ordinary shares together with our preference shares, and related material provisions of our articles of association and of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code (Boek 2 van het Burgerlijk Wetboek). This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our articles of association and to Dutch law. General We were incorporated as a limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) on October 9, 2000 by deed executed before Mr. R.J.J. Lijdsman, civil law notary. Our corporate seat is in Leiden, the Netherlands, and we have offices at Archimedesweg 4-6, 2333 CN Leiden, the Netherlands. We are registered in the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Leiden under number 28087740. The statement of no objection of the Minister of Justice in respect of our deed of incorporation was issued on October 9, 2000 under number N.V. 1133178. Our agent in the US is CT Corporation, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011. Our articles of association were last amended on 23 July 2008 before Mr. R.J.J. Lijdsman, civil law notary. Corporate purpose The objects of the Company are set out in Article 3 of the articles of association. Our objects include acquiring, establishing and managing companies in our field, controlling and using intellectual property, and funding of our operations as well as to do all that is connected therewith or may be conducive thereto. Limitation of liability and indemnification matters Pursuant to Dutch law, each member of our Supervisory and Management Boards is responsible to us for the proper performance of his or her assigned duties. They are also responsible for taking measures to prevent the consequences of any improper performance of duties by another member of our Supervisory Board or our Management Board. Our articles of association provide that our Management Board members and our Supervisory Board members are released from liability for the exercise of their duties as board members, if our General Meeting of Shareholders adopts a resolution to that effect. This discharge extends only to the exercise of the duties reflected in the annual accounts or otherwise disclosed to our General Meeting of Shareholders prior to the adoption of the annual accounts. This release of liability may be limited by virtue of Dutch law, such as in the case of bankruptcy. Under Dutch law, our Supervisory Board members and members of our Management Board generally cannot be held personally liable for actions taken in their capacity as such, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not eliminate or limit the liability (1) for any breach of such individuals duty of loyalty to the Company or its shareholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) for any transaction from which the member derived an improper personal benefit or (4) for personal liability which is imposed by Dutch law, as may be amended from time to time. Our articles of association provide that we shall generally indemnify any person who is or was a member of our Supervisory Board or our Management Board, and suffers any loss as a result of any action in connection with the execution of his duties for us, provided he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to our best interests, and with respect to criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful or beyond his mandate. This indemnification generally will not be available if the person seeking indemnification was adjudged liable for acting with gross negligence or wilful misconduct in the performance of his duties to us, unless the court in which the action was brought, determines that indemnification is appropriate nonetheless. Share capital Our authorized share capital amounts to  40.8 million divided into: 85,000,000 ordinary shares and 85,000,000 preference shares, each with a par value of  0.24. At December 31, 2008, there were 65,833,242 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. No preference shares are currently issued and outstanding. The ordinary shares can be issued in bearer or registered form. The preference shares can only be issued in registered form. Only bearer ordinary shares can trade on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam. No share certificates will be issued for shares in registered form. 117 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital Ordinary shares Our ordinary shares may be in registered or bearer form and will be in bearer form unless the shareholder indicates otherwise in writing. Bearer ordinary shares All of our bearer ordinary shares are embodied in a single global share certificate which will not be exchanged for single or multiple physical securities and which we will deposit with the Dutch Securities Depository (NECIGEF) for safekeeping on behalf of the parties entitled to the ordinary shares in bearer form. The ordinary shares represented by the single global share certificate may only be transferred through the book-entry system maintained by NECIGEF. A participant in the collective deposit (verzameldepot) of a securities institution admitted to NECIGEF may, at his own expense, require conversion of one or more of his bearer ordinary shares into ordinary shares in registered form. Registered ordinary shares We enter holders of registered ordinary shares in the register of shareholders. We do not issue share certificates. However, the shareholder may request an extract from the shareholders register regarding the ordinary shares registered in his name. We are required to provide this free of charge. Dutch law requires that transfers of registered ordinary shares be recorded in a written instrument to which we are a party or which is served on us, or that the transaction is acknowledged by us. Preference shares As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not issued any preference shares. On October 25, 2000, we established a foundation called Stichting Preferente Aandelen Crucell, also referred to as the Preferred Foundation. The Preferred Foundations objective is to safeguard our interests, our business and parties connected therewith by blocking any influences that may threaten these interests, which interests may include the continuity of the Company, identity of the proposed acquirer or identity of us, our business and the parties connected therewith. The Preferred Foundation can safeguard these interests through acquiring and managing our preference shares and by exercising the rights attaching to these shares, in particular, the voting rights. The Preferred Foundation has an option to acquire preference shares up to 100% of the number of our outstanding shares, necessary to match the total number of statutory votes on all of the ordinary shares outstanding at the time of an acquisition. The Preferred Foundation must pay at least 25% of the nominal value of the preference shares it acquires from us. If we acquire any preference shares, they may be cancelled. A board of governors of up to five persons directs the Preferred Foundation. Jan Oosterveld, in his capacity as chairman of our Supervisory Board, and Pieter Bouw, Mick W. den Boogert, Sweder van Wijnbergen and Gerard P. Krans, have been appointed to the board of governors. A majority of these members may not be members or former members of our Management or Supervisory Board, or an employee of any of our advisers, any of our banks or us. These independent members are appointed by the board of governors. The non-independent members are appointed by our Supervisory Board after consultation with our Management Board. Membership of the board of governors of the Preferred Foundation terminates upon: · Voluntary retirement, reaching the age of 72, death or bankruptcy; · For our non independent members, resignation, or dismissal by the members of our Supervisory Board; · For our independent members, if they cease to be independent; · Dismissal by the complete board of the Preferred Foundation; or · Periodic retirement in accordance with a rotation plan to be drawn up by the Preferred Foundations board of governors, however, these members may be reappointed. Issue of shares and pre-emptive rights Our General Meeting of Shareholders, or our Management Board if the General Meeting of Shareholders has delegated the power to it, has the authority to decide on any further issuance of shares or rights to subscribe for shares and on the terms and conditions of such issuance. Our Management Board is the authorized corporate body (orgaan) for this purpose until November 30, 2009, and the authorization may at any time be extended by the General Meeting of Shareholders for periods of up to five years. Our Management Boards authority to issue shares is limited to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital at the time of issue, plus a further issue up to 10% of the issued share capital at the time of issue in case the issue takes place in relation to a merger or an acquisition. 118 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital Our Management Board can issue shares of any class if it has the approval of our Supervisory Board. Without specific authorization from our General Meeting of Shareholders our Management Board may not issue preference shares or grant options for such shares if, as a result, more preference shares than ordinary shares will or could become outstanding. Each holder of ordinary shares has pre-emptive rights to subscribe for any ordinary shares that we issue and has pre-emptive rights to subscribe if we grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares. Pre-emptive rights are in proportion to the percentage of our outstanding ordinary shares that the holder owns. Pre-emptive rights do not apply to ordinary shares issued for a non-cash contribution, to ordinary shares issued to our employees or ordinary shares issued to a person who exercises a previously acquired right to subscribe for ordinary shares. Holders of preference shares do not have pre-emptive rights if we issue ordinary shares, and holders of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights to purchase preference shares if we issue preference shares. If our Management Board has been delegated the authority to issue shares, it can limit or exclude any pre-emptive rights as long as the general meeting of shareholders has granted it that power and our Supervisory Board approves. At present, our Management Board is authorized to do this. This authorization is valid until November 30, 2009 and the General Meeting of Shareholders may at any time extend this authorization for periods of up to five years. Our shares cannot be issued below par. The ordinary shares must be fully paid up upon issue. Preference shares may be issued without being fully paid up, but at least one-quarter of the nominal amount must be paid up upon subscription, and each issue of preference shares must have the same amount paid up. Our Management Board may determine the day and the amount of a further call for payment on preference shares. Acquisition by us of shares in our own capital We may acquire our own fully paid up shares if the following conditions are met: · Our General Meeting of Shareholders has authorized our Management Board to acquire the shares; · The authorization specifies the number of shares that we may acquire, the manner in which they may be acquired and the limits within which the price must be set; · Our shareholders equity, after deduction of the price of acquisition, is not less than the sum of the paid and called up portion of the share capital and the reserves that provisions of Dutch law or our articles of association require us to maintain; and · The aggregate par value of the shares to be acquired, together with the shares in our share capital that we already hold directly, indirectly or as pledgee, does not equal more than one-tenth the aggregate par value of our total issued share capital. An authorization by the General Meeting of Shareholders for a term of a maximum of 18 months is needed in the event of an acquisition for valuable consideration. Currently an authorization is granted to the Management Board by the General Meeting of Shareholders to repurchase fully paid up ordinary shares up to 10% of our outstanding share capital until November 30, 2009. The repurchase price lies between the nominal value of the shares and an amount equal to 110% of the highest price officially quoted on the NASDAQ National Market and the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on any of five (5) banking days preceding the date of the repurchase. We and our subsidiaries may not vote shares that we or they hold. We may acquire shares to transfer them to our employees or the employees of our group companies under designated stock option plans without authorization. Capital reduction If our Management Board proposes, our Supervisory Board approves and Dutch law permits, the General Meeting of Shareholders can reduce our issued share capital by cancellation of shares or reduction of the nominal value of shares. Other key provisions of our articles of association Voting rights and shareholders meetings We must hold annual general meetings of shareholders within six months of the end of our financial year. The annual meeting is held, among other things, to adopt our annual accounts. We must hold extraordinary general meetings of shareholders whenever: 119 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital · Shareholders and holders of American depositary receipts for shares together representing at least one- tenth of our outstanding share capital request it in writing, listing the topics to be discussed; and · Our Management Board or our Supervisory Board deems appropriate. General meetings of shareholders may only be held in the municipalities of Leiden, Amsterdam, Haarlemmermeer (including Schiphol Airport and Schiphol-Rijk), Utrecht, Rotterdam and The Hague. Each shareholder can attend general meetings in person or by proxy, address the meeting and vote. Each share, whether ordinary or preference, confers one vote on the shareholder. The Management Board must be notified in writing of a registered shareholders intention to attend the General Meeting of Shareholders. The holders of bearer ordinary shares can vote if a NECIGEF participant sends a written statement as to their shareholdings to our offices. Resolutions are passed by absolute majority of votes cast unless stated otherwise in Dutch law and our articles of association. Shareholders representing alone, or in aggregate, at least one percent (1%) of our issued capital or  according to the Euronext Official Price List  at least a value of 50 million Euro, have the right to request the Management Board and the Supervisory Board to place items on the agenda of the General Meeting of Shareholders. These requests shall be honoured on the condition: · That the shareholders have a reasonable interest in the items to be considered; · That the placing on the agenda is not in conflict with the orderly course of the meeting and that there shall be no material interest against placing the item on the agenda; and · That the request has been filed in writing with the Management Board or the Chairman of the Supervisory Board at least 60 days prior to the date of the General Meeting of Shareholders. The General Meeting of Shareholders can amend our articles of association, dissolve us, merge us or demerge us only if proposed by the Supervisory Board. Dutch law and our articles of association do not impose any limitations on non-Dutch ownership or voting of our ordinary shares. Approval rights of the Supervisory Board Our Supervisory Board must approve certain resolutions of our Management Board, which are specified in our articles of association. Annual Report We have a calendar financial year. Dutch law requires that within four months after the end of our financial year, unless the general meeting of shareholders has extended this period for a maximum of six months, our Management Board must make available to the shareholders a report with respect to that financial year. This report must include the financial statements and a report of an independent accountant. The Annual Report is submitted to the annual General Meeting of Shareholders for adoption. See Information for Shareholders and Investors  Limitation of Liability and Indemnification Matters. Dividends Annual dividends may only be paid out of profits as shown in the adopted annual financial statements. We may not make distributions if the distribution would reduce our shareholders equity below certain reserves required by Dutch law or by our articles of association. The profits must first be used to set up and maintain reserves required by Dutch law and must then be set off against certain financial losses. The dividends for the preference shares will be a certain percentage of their nominal value. These will be paid first. With Supervisory Board approval, our Management Board then decides whether and how much of the remaining profit they will reserve. Any profits remaining shall be paid as a dividend on the ordinary shares, if the retained earnings are negative or are to be used to form a statutory reserve no dividend will be paid out. With the approval of our Supervisory Board and subject to Dutch law, our Management Board can pay an interim dividend. We can make distributions to shareholders at the charge of one or more of our reserves. Holders of shares are entitled to the full dividend for the financial year 2000 and subsequent financial years. Any dividends that are not claimed within five years of their declaration revert to us. Amendment of our articles of association and liquidation rights The General Meeting of Shareholders may only resolve to amend our articles of association or to dissolve, merge or demerge us on the proposal of our Supervisory Board. The class of shareholders 120 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital affected must approve a resolution to amend the articles of association to change the rights of the class. If we are dissolved and liquidated, after we pay all debts and liquidation expenses, the holders of preference shares have first rights to payment of any dividends not fully paid to them in previous years and of the nominal value of their preference shares. Any remaining assets will be distributed to the holders of ordinary shares. Enforcement of civil liabilities We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and the majority of the members of our Supervisory Board, all of the members of our Management Board and management team and all of the experts named in this document are residents of, and most of our and their assets are located in, jurisdictions outside the US. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the US upon us or these persons, or to enforce against us or these persons in courts in the US, judgments of these courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of US securities laws. In addition, it is not clear whether a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, members of our Management Board or Supervisory Board or management team or any of the experts named in this document in an original action based solely upon the federal securities laws of the US brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands. Dutch law, furthermore, does not recognize a shareholders right to bring a derivative action on behalf of a corporation. Our legal counsel in the Netherlands, Allen & Overy, has advised us that because there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between the US and the Netherlands, courts in the Netherlands will not automatically enforce a final judgment rendered by a US court. In order to obtain a judgment enforceable in the Netherlands, claimants must litigate the relevant claim again before a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction. Under current practice, however, a Dutch court will recognize a final and conclusive judgment rendered by a US court if the Dutch court finds that: · The US court assumed jurisdiction on grounds that are acceptable from an international law perspective; · The final judgment results from proceedings compatible with Dutch concepts of due process; and · The final judgment does not contravene public policy of the Netherlands. If the Dutch court recognizes the final US judgment, that court generally will grant the same judgment without the parties having to litigate again on the merits. Obligations of shareholders to disclose holdings under Dutch law Under the Financial Supervision Act any person who, directly or indirectly, acquires, or disposes of, an interest in the capital and/or the voting rights of a public limited liability company incorporated under Dutch law with an official listing on a stock exchange within the European Economic Area must immediately give written notice to the Dutch securities regulator AFM by means of a standard form, of such acquisition or disposal if, as a result of such acquisition or disposal, the percentage of capital interest and/or voting rights held by such person meets, exceeds or falls below the following thresholds: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 95%. The notification requirement also applies if a persons capital interest or voting right meets, exceeds or falls below the above mentioned thresholds as a result of a change in the share capital or voting rights, and the notification must be made no later than the fourth trading day after the AFM has published the notification as described in the following sentence. Crucell is required to notify the AFM immediately if its share capital or voting rights change by 1% or more since the previous notification. Other changes must be notified periodically. In addition, the members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board are required to immediately notify the AFM of any change in the number of Crucell shares or options they hold or voting rights in respect of these shares. The AFM will disclose this information in a public register on its website. Non-compliance with the obligations of the Financial Supervision Act can lead to criminal prosecution. In addition, a civil court can issue orders against any person who fails to notify or incorrectly notifies in accordance with the Financial Supervision Act, including suspension of the voting rights in respect of such person s ordinary shares. 121 Management Report 122 Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 124 Financial Statements 125 Consolidated Income Statements 125 Consolidated Balance Sheets 126 Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity 127 Consolidated Cash Flow Statements 128 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 129 Company Financial Statements 171 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 172 Other Information 175 Auditors Report 176 Information for Shareholders and Investors 177 Appendix Overview Licensees and Partners 186 Cross-Reference to Form 20-F 188 Exhibits 190 123 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Supervisory Board and Shareholders of Crucell N.V. Leiden, the Netherlands We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Crucell N.V. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Crucell N.V. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. As discussed in note 1.5.1 to the financial statements as of January 1, 2008, the Company changed its method of accounting for pension assets to conform to IFRIC 14, and retrospectively, adjusted the 2007 and 2006 financial statements for the change. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated April 21, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

(Crucell or the Company) is incorporated and domiciled in Leiden, the Netherlands. Its shares are publicly traded on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam (CRXL), and SWX Swiss Exchange Zurich (CRX). Its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) are publicly traded on NASDAQ New York (CRXL). Crucell and its subsidiaries together constitute the Crucell Group, or the Group. The Company has subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Korea and the US. Crucell employed 1,126 people at December 31, 2008 (2007: 1,126). Crucell is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing, producing and marketing products to combat infectious diseases. Its core vaccine portfolio includes Inflexal V, a vaccine against influenza, paediatric vaccines Hepavax-Gene, Quinvaxem and MoRu-Viraten, and travel vaccines Vivotif, Dukoral, and Epaxal. In addition to these portfolio vaccines, the Group has a broad pipeline of new potential vaccines and proteins. The Group has developed various proprietary technologies such as PER.C6, MAbstract, AdVac, STAR and virosome-adjuvanted technologies. Crucell licenses these proprietary technologies to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. Changes in the scope of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results of the acquired companies for the period from the date of acquisition unless mentioned otherwise. There have been the following changes in the scope of consolidation in 2008. · In November 2008, the Group sold its fully-owned subsidiary Etna Biotech Srl (Catania, Italy) to Zydus Cadila (Ahmedabad, India). The sale resulted in net proceeds for Crucell of  182; · In December 2008, SBL Vaccin Holding AB and Vitec AB legally merged into SBL Vaccin AB; On November 30, 2007, Rhein Vaccines B.V. legally merged into Berna Rhein B.V. and ceased to exist as of that date. In 2006, the most significant changes in the scope of consolidation were due to: · The acquisition of the shares of Berna Biotech AG (February 2006); · The establishment of Crucell Vaccines Inc. followed by the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Berna Products Corporation (October 2006); and · The acquisition of the shares of SBL Vaccin Holding AB (November 2006). Further details on these acquisitions are provided in note 5.8.

As the Group adopted IFRIC 14 there are no differences between IFRS applied by the Group and IFRS as endorsed by the EU. As permitted by article 362 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code, the company financial statements have been prepared applying the same IFRS accounting policies as used in the consolidated financial statements. In conformity with article 402, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the Company income statement is presented in abbreviated form. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 on form 20-F were authorized for issue in accordance with a directors resolution on April 17, 2009. Foreign currency translation The functional and presentation currency of the Company is the Euro. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand ( 000) unless indicated otherwise. Each entity in the group determines its own functional currency based on the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. At the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with different functional currencies are translated into Euro at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements and cash flow statements are translated into Euro at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. The exchange rate differences arising on the translation are taken directly to the translation reserve, a separate component of equity. 1.3 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries per December 31 and for the period then ended. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Group, using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operational policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, which is the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date such control ceases. Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss for the year and net assets at the end of the year not held by the Group and are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the equity attributable to equity holders of the parent. 130 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. A jointly controlled entity is a joint venture that involves the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest. The Group recognizes its interest in joint ventures using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in the joint venture is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the joint venture. The income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the joint venture. Periodically the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss with respect to the Groups net investment in the joint venture. The reporting dates of the joint ventures are the same as those of the Group and the accounting policies of the joint ventures conform to those used by the Group. Associates The Groups investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. The reporting dates of the associates are the same as those of the Group and the associates accounting policies conform to those used by the Group. 1.4 Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and use of critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognized in the financial statements are described below. Revenue recognition Sales transactions concluded by the Group may be complex as the underlying sales agreements can contain multiple components whose accounting treatment may be affected by the other components. Reviewing these agreements requires due care and a degree of managements judgment. Revenue is not recognized before it is assessed that significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and that the Group retains no continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the goods sold. For some transactions this can result in cash receipts being initially recognized as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent periods on the basis of the performance of the conditions specified in the agreement. The Group is also subject to various licensing agreements that contain milestones that may only be recognized if they are substantive. Determining whether a milestone is substantive also requires management judgment. Valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities Determination of income taxes in jurisdictions in which the Group operates, requires exercising judgment. This involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing the valuation of carry forward losses and temporary differences. The temporary differences mainly relate to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, inventories and pension assets. In assessing the valuation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities the following items are considered: the future taxable profit projections, historical results, tax planning strategies, changes (substantially) enacted in tax laws and the specific timing of the recovery of deferred tax positions. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or after final review of our tax returns by tax authorities, the Group may need to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which could materially impact the financial position and results of operations. Management believes that the estimates are reasonable. As at December 31, 2008, the Group had unrecognized tax carry forward losses of  172,732 (2007:  254,511, 2006:  222,338) that are available, with certain restrictions in time, for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Management assessed the likelihood that the carry forward losses will be recovered from future taxable profit. To the extent Management believes that recovery is probable, a deferred tax asset was recognized, which at December 31, 2008 131 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements was  9,060 (2007:  678, 2006:  749). To the extent the likelihood of recovery of deferred tax assets changes, an expense or a gain within the tax charge in our income statement for the relevant period will be included. Accounting for business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. This involves recognizing identifiable assets (including previously unrecognized intangible assets) and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of the acquired business at the estimated fair values at acquisition date. Judgments, made in identifying and valuating assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination and in determining the useful life of any acquired assets, can significantly affect both current period as future periods operating results. Estimated fair values in a business combination are based on information available at the date that the purchase price allocation is completed. Assets and liabilities may be adjusted or recognized retrospectively within the period of one year if management receives additional information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the total consideration over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill includes intangible assets that were identified in a business combination, but not valued separately because the assets were either not separable or could not be measured reliably. Assets identified and included as part of goodwill can be specific customer relationships, supply contracts not meeting the recognition requirements or the workforce acquired. Goodwill recognized can significantly affect both current period as future periods operating results as goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review and not to periodical amortization. Goodwill at December 31, 2008 amounted to  46,076 compared to  44,377 at the end of 2007. Goodwill increased due to a strengthening of the foreign currencies underlying the investment in the foreign operations. The increase is mainly caused by the appreciation of the Swiss Franc and the US Dollar against the Euro in 2008. Impairment reviews of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill An assets recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is tested at the level of the cash generating unit. The Group starts its impairment reviews of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill by determining the assets (or cash generating units) recoverable amount based on the fair value less costs to sell of an asset. If the fair value less costs to sell does not exceed the carrying amount, the Group will also consider the value in use before an asset is impaired. The best evidence of an assets fair value less costs to sell is a price in a binding sale agreement in an arms length transaction, adjusted for incremental costs that would be directly attributable to the disposal of the asset. However for most of the Groups assets there are typically no observable market prices as the assets have a level of specificity for which no active market exists. The fair values less costs to sell are predominantly based on discounted net present value calculations that use assumptions applicable in the current market. Key assumptions are those regarding the discount rates, the estimated terminal growth rate, expected changes to market share and the selling prices and costs in the forecasted period. Where applicable, the forecasted cash flows for pre-clinical programs are adjusted for the risk of failure of the program. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets The Group assesses for its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If there is such an indication of impairment or when an annual impairment test for an asset is required, an impairment test is performed. In the year ended December 31, 2006, an impairment loss of  19,568 was recognized for two buildings, including installed equipment, that were acquired in the business combination with Berna Biotech AG. Both buildings are located in Switzerland. Berna Biotech AG performed contract manufacturing and conducted a candidate vaccine development program in those buildings. The development of the candidate vaccine and the contract manufacturing were phased out during 2007. The buildings are specially configured for biotechnology purposes and it is impracticable to separate the equipment from the buildings. Since at the time there was no direct use for these buildings for any of the Groups other activities, no market for the sale of the buildings to third parties and no expectation that these buildings 132 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements could be utilized in the foreseeable future, an impairment was recorded for the total carrying amount of  19,568 as at December 31, 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006 an impairment loss of  10,848 was recognized on the in-process research and development of the Tetra vaccine which was acquired in February 2006 when the Company acquired Berna Biotech AG. Management decided to stop the development of Tetra after Quinvaxem received approval by the WHO. Consequently, the carrying value of Tetra was impaired for the total amount of  10,848. An impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. In the first quarter of 2008, the Group entered into an exclusive agreement with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. The Group develops and manufactures certain components of a vaccine for use by Wyeth in clinical studies. The contract manufacturing takes place in one of the two buildings that was impaired in 2006, as discussed above. The Group reassessed the recoverable amount of the asset and reversed  5,219 of the previously recognized impairment loss in the 2008 financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Group also recognized an impairment charge of  331 for the animal housing facility in Bern, Switzerland, that is no longer in use. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed annually or more frequently when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. The discounted net present value calculations are derived from the Groups most recent long range plan, which forecasts the period for the next five years. Beyond this five year window, cash flows are extrapolated based on the estimated terminal growth rate. Management exercised judgment in determining the segments and the subsequent allocation of the goodwill. In 2008, the Group reorganized its reporting structure in a way that changes the composition of one or more cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated, as the Vaccines and Proteins business units were integrated. In the prior year, all goodwill was allocated to the Vaccines Unit. As a result of the change in composition, Management had to reallocate the goodwill and decided to assign all goodwill to the 2006 business acquisitions that led to the recognition of the goodwill. Management decided not to allocate the goodwill to the individual business acquisitions as the operations are integrated and the allocation would be arbitrary. Valuation of defined benefit plans Under defined benefit plans, the pension entitlements are calculated using the projected unit credit actuarial method. The pension liability recognized in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets after adding or subtracting unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and past-service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and any unrecognized past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The weighted average of the principal assumptions used in determining the employee benefit obligations for the defined benefit plans of the Group are shown below: 2008 2007 2006 Discount rate 3.37% 3.40% 3.32% Expected return on plan assets 4.53% 4.53% 4.55% Future salary increases 1.19% 1.22% 1.19% Future pension increases 0.71% 0.78% 0.66% Share based payments Option plans The Company operates share-based payment programs, whereby in consideration for equity instruments both employees and non-employees render services. The cost of equity-settled share-based option programs are measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The Company accounts for its stock options under the fair value method. The following weighted average assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the stock options. 133 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate 4.3% 4.1% 3.6% Expected dividend yield    Expected volatility 36.7% 33.3% 41.8% Expected life (years) 4.76 4.25 4.25 Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Companys stock measured over a period commensurate with the expected term of the grants. The expected term used is based on the anticipated exercise behaviour. Dividend yields used are based on historical information as to dividends declared by the Company. Risk-free interest rates used are equal to the implied yield available on zero-coupon Dutch government bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the share-based instrument. Some of our share-based option programs include specific market-based conditions that are estimated at the time of the grant, as IFRS 2 does not allow updates to the original estimate for market-based conditions during the vesting period. Estimates of market based conditions that have an effect on the fair values of any shares or options allocated in our share based payment plans are share price growth on the stock markets and our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to a index of biotech companies. TSR reflects the return received by a shareholder, taking into account both the change in share price and dividends received, while assuming dividends are re-invested in the Company. Recognition of provisions for litigations and claims Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Management uses judgment in determining the provision for litigations and exposure to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims. Judgment is used in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed or a liability will arise and in quantifying the possible range of the final settlement. The Group is subjected to (potential) lawsuits and other legal proceedings, resulting from the ordinary course of business. The current status of pending proceedings has been reviewed with legal counsel. Upon consideration of known relevant facts and circumstances, provisions were recognized for losses that are considered to be more likely than not and that can reasonably be estimated as of the balance sheet date. Valuation of inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Management exercises judgment in determining the allowance for obsolete inventory. Inventories are usually written down to net realizable value item by item. In some circumstances, however, it may be appropriate to group similar or related items. In these cases, the Group considers numerous items, which include test results by quality control, review by local supply chain, historic scrapping and rejection percentages per product and the current product portfolio. The allowance recognized in 2008 is  3,218 (2007:  6,428). 1.5 Changes in accounting policies 1.5.1 New adopted accounting policies in the financial year 2008 IFRIC 14, IAS 19  The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interactions, as issued by the IASB is effective in periods beginning on or after January 1, 2008. This interpretation is endorsed by the EU with the change that it should be applied at the latest, as from the commencement date of its first financial year starting after 31 December 2008. The difference in the effective date would for the Group cause a difference in equity and results between IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as endorsed by the EU. Foreign private issuers that are unable to assert compliance with IASB-issued IFRS have to reconcile their financial information to US GAAP. To avoid a mandatory reconciliation between IFRS as endorsed by the EU and US GAAP, the Group adopted IFRIC 14 effective as of January 1, 2008. The interpretation provides guidance on assessing the limit of the surplus in a defined benefit pension fund that can be recognized as an asset. It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement. The pension fund in Switzerland has a minimum funding requirement with economic benefits from overfunding being available as a reduction of future contributions. The application of the interpretation results in an increase in the assets recorded on the Groups balance sheet and a corresponding increase in the Groups equity. 134 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements As required by the transition provisions of IFRIC 14, the Group has applied the revised standard retrospectively as of the beginning of the first period presented in the first financial statements to which the interpretation applies. The impact on the December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated income statements are as follows: In thousands of Euro 2008 2007 2006 After After Before IFRIC 14 Before retrospective Before retrospective IFRIC 14 Impact adopted IFRIC 14 Impact application IFRIC 14 Impact application Income statement Gross margin 121,402  121,402 68,902  68,902 41,078  41,078 Operating expenses (132,367 ) 2,676 (129,691 ) (129,787 ) 3,869 (125,918 ) (148,341 ) 467 (147,874 ) Profit (loss) before tax 3,600 2,676 6,276 (48,987 ) 3,869 (45,118 ) (98,116 ) 467 (97,649 ) Income Tax 8,885 (575 ) 8,310 3,040 (832 ) 2,208 10,551 (100 ) 10,451 Profit/(loss) for the year 12,485 2,101 14,586 (45,947 ) 3,037 (42,910 ) (87,565 ) 367 (87,198 ) Balance sheet Pension asset recognized 759 7,853 8,612 2,479 4,918 7,397 2,555 746 3,301 Deferred tax liabilities (15,297 ) (1,688 ) (16,985 ) (28,210 ) (1,057 ) (29,267 ) (33,586 ) (160 ) (33,746 ) Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent (447,327 ) (6,165) (453,492 ) (437,242 ) (3,861 ) (441,103 ) (497,300 ) (586 ) (497,886 ) Profit (loss) per share  basic 0.21 0.01 0.22 (0.71 ) 0.05 (0.66 ) (1.53 ) 0.01 (1.52 ) Profit (loss) per share  diluted 0.21 0.01 0.22 (0.71 ) 0.05 (0.66 ) (1.53 ) 0.01 (1.52 ) The following standard was not yet effective at December 31, 2008, but has been early adopted by the group: · IFRS 8, Operating segments (effective from January 1, 2009). IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 Segment reporting and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. The new standard requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. The Group applies IFRS 8 from January 1, 2007. The impact of the early adoption is described in note 4 Segment information. 1.5.2 Other new accounting pronouncements The following amendments to existing standards and interpretations were not yet effective at the balance sheet date and were not early adopted by the Group: · IAS 23 (Amendment), Borrowing costs (effective from January 1, 2009). The amendment requires an entity to capitalize borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of that asset. The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed. The Group will apply IAS 23 (Amended) from January 1, 2009, but adoption will have no impact on the Groups financial statements as borrowing costs directly attributable to qualifying assets are already capitalized in line with the allowed alternative treatment of IAS 23. · IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of financial statements (effective from January 1, 2009).The revised standard will prohibit the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is, non-owner changes in equity) in the statement of changes in equity, requiring non-owner changes in equity to be presented separately from owner changes in equity. All non-owner changes in equity will be required to be shown in a performance statement, but entities can choose whether to present one performance statement (the statement of comprehensive income) or two statements (the income statement and statement of comprehensive income). The Group will apply IAS 1 (Revised) from January 1, 2009. · IFRS 2 (Amendment), Share-based payment (effective from January 1, 2009). The amended standard deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. It clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a share-based 135 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements payment are not vesting conditions. These features would need to be included in the grant date fair value for transactions with employees and others providing similar services; they would not impact the number of awards expected to vest or valuation thereof subsequent to grant date. All cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. The Group will apply IFRS 2 (Amendment) from January 1, 2009 and currently assesses the impact of the amended standard. · IFRS 3 (Revised), Business combinations (effective from July 1, 2009). The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant changes. For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classified as debt subsequently re-measured through the income statement. There is a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets. All acquisition-related costs should be expensed. The Group will apply IFRS 3 (Revised), Business combinations from January 1, 2010 and currently assesses the impact of the amended standard. · IAS 36 (Amendment), Impairment of assets (effective from January 1, 2009). The amendment is part of the IASBs annual improvements project published in May 2008. Where fair value less costs to sell is calculated on the basis of discounted cash flows, disclosures equivalent to those for value-in-use calculation should be made. The Group will apply the IAS 36 (Amendment) and provide the required disclosure where applicable for impairment tests from January 1, 2009. Not all amendments to existing standards and interpretations that are not yet effective and not early adopted by the Group have been listed above as they may not be applicable to the operations of the Group or are not likely to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group. The Group currently assesses in detail the impact of the amendments and interpretations. 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 2.1 Revenue recognition General In general, revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue and the costs (to be) incurred in the transaction can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, value added taxes and duties. Revenues are recognized on a gross basis when the Group acts as the principal in an arrangement, and recognized on a net basis when the Group acts as agent. Goods or services traded for items of a similar nature are not regarded as transactions that generate revenue. Goods or services traded for dissimilar items are regarded as transactions that generate revenue. Product sales Revenue from product sales is recognized when: · Significant risk and rewards of ownership of the products have passed to the buyer; · The Group does not retain either managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership or effective control over the goods sold; · The amount of revenue and the costs (to be) incurred in the transaction can be measured reliably; and · It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Products could include a specific right to return, either pursuant to the sales contract or local law. Revenue from that sale is recognized at time of sale only if all of the following conditions are met in addition to the general revenue recognition terms described above: · The customer is obligated to pay and that obligation is not contingent on resale of the product; · The customers obligation to pay will not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product; 136 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements · The customer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the Group, e.g. the customer sells other products besides the products the Group delivers to it; · The Group does not have significant future performance obligations to directly ensure resale of the product by the buyer; and · The amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. Revenue and cost of sales that are not recognized at the time of the sale because the foregoing conditions were not met are recognized on the earlier of either the substantial expiration of the customers right to return the product or the subsequent satisfaction of those conditions. License revenues The Group recognizes initial fees to the licensing of the technology as revenues over the period of the significant continuing performance obligations, if any, and upon transfer of the significant risks and rewards to the buyer. Under certain arrangements, the Group has no continuing performance obligations after delivery of the associated technology under the license agreement or any other arrangement with the licensee. In such arrangements, initial license fees are recognized as revenue when significant risks and rewards pass to the buyer, which is the moment the transfer of developed technology is completed. The Groups arrangements provide for continuing support of its technology at standard consulting rates. Revenues derived from consulting services that are not essential to licensees ability to use the Groups technology, are recognized as earned during the period that the consulting services are performed. In certain arrangements, the Group collaborates with third parties to develop novel products or processes using its proprietary technology. These arrangements generally include an initial license fee upon the delivery of the proprietary technology and additional fees for providing ongoing research and development activities. The research and development activities performed are substantive and critical to the licensees exploitation of the delivered technology. When significant risks and rewards pass to the buyer, initial fees from these arrangements are recognized as revenues over the period of continuing performance obligations. Additional fees from research and development activities are recognized as revenues earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation. All fees received under collaboration agreements are non-refundable. Certain of the Groups license agreements provide for additional non-refundable fees to be paid to the Group upon the achievement of milestones by the licensee. These milestone payments may be included in license agreements regardless of whether the Group has continuing performance obligations under a particular agreement. For license agreements where there are no continuing performance obligations, milestone revenue is recognized when those amounts become due and payable upon achievement of the milestone. The licensee has to confirm the achievement of a milestone in writing before the revenue is recognized. The Group also has license agreements with continuing performance obligations. License revenues from the achievement of these research and development milestones, if deemed substantive (as described below), are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved, and the milestone payments are due and collectible under the terms of the agreement. Milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met: · The milestone payments are non-refundable under the terms of the agreement; · Achievement of the milestone involved a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement; · Substantial effort is involved in achieving the milestone; · The amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone; and · A reasonable amount of time passed between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment. If any of these conditions are not met, the Group would recognize the proportionate amount of the milestone payment upon receipt as revenue that 137 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements corresponds with the percentage of work already completed. The remaining portion of the milestone payment would be deferred and recognized as revenue as performance obligations are completed. In addition to the initial fee, the Groups arrangements generally provide that the licensee makes semi-annual or annual payments (called license maintenance fees) to maintain the license for a subsequent term. Generally, licensees may terminate the license and related maintenance fees upon 30 to 90 days notice. License maintenance fees are recognized as revenues when the amounts become fixed and payable. The aggregate of license maintenance fees paid are generally deductible from any earned royalty payments which may be due on future product sales of the licensee, if any, under the license agreement. Royalties are recognized as revenue when they become fixed and payable. Service fees As part of various collaboration agreements, the Group receives service fees for work performed under such agreements. The Group does not retain the residual interest on products developed under the agreements and will normally not have ownership of intellectual property rights on these products. Revenues and related costs associated with completing performance services are recognized when the service is completed and the collectibility of the receivable is deemed probable. Revenues associated with time and material performance contracts are recognized when the costs incurred and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably. 2.2 Cost of product sales and cost of service fees Cost of product sales and cost of service fees both comprise direct labor, materials and overhead costs, incurred in performing work under various collaboration agreements that directly relate to revenues earned. 2.3 Other operating income Government grants The Group receives certain government grants that support research efforts in defined projects. These grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in various grants. Income associated with these grants is recognized when costs under each grant are incurred in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant and the collectibility of the receivable is deemed probable and there is reasonable assurance that attaching conditions will be achieved. Where the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Other income Other income mainly consists of the reimbursement of development costs and funding by non-governmental agencies, but also includes non-core business transactions such as the sale of property, plant and equipment and income generated from training courses. 2.4 Research and Development expenses Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Internally generated intangible assets arising from the Groups development activities are recognized if all of the recognition criteria for internally generated intangible assets are met, including: · An asset is created that can be identified; · It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and · The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Product registration fees will, in principle, meet these recognition requirements. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognized, development expenditure is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Research and development expenses consist of personnel expenses, laboratory expenses, technology purchases, patent related fees, technology license fees, depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets related to research and development, and lease expenses for lab space and equipment leases. Research and development expenses also include fees paid to third parties who conduct research on behalf of the Group. 138 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2.5 Taxes Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantially enacted, at the balance sheet date. Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in the income statement. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to offset the recognized amounts and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax Deferred income tax is calculated using the asset and liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts under IFRS. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except: · Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and · In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forwards of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, can be utilized. The unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 2.6 Profit/ (loss) per share Basic net profit/ (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net profit/ (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, including the dilutive effect of stock options, if any. 2.7 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less that are convertible to a known amount of cash and bear an insignificant risk of change in value. 2.8 Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available for sale. The Group has no held-to-maturity investments. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorized as held for trading unless they are designated as formal hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 139 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Groups loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets and other current assets in the balance sheet. Trade accounts receivable, other current assets and other financial assets Trade accounts receivable, other current assets and other financial assets are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale investments are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with unrealized gains or losses being recognized directly in equity in the net unrealized gains reserve. When the investment is disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously recorded in equity is recognized in the income statement. Available-for-sale investments are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognized when: · The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; · The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass through arrangement; or · The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 2.9 Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. The fair value is based on the market prices of the instruments. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. To the extent that no formal hedge accounting is applied, any gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the instruments are recognized in the income statement during the period in which they arise. The Group applies formal hedge accounting for specific forward derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of derivative instruments, the relationship between the derivative and the underlying financial instrument, as well as the objective of the risk management and the strategy for undertaking transactions are documented. In the documentation it is also stated whether the hedge relationship is expected to be highly effective (prospective and retrospective) and how the effectiveness is tested. Changes in the fair value of a highly effective derivative, that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are recorded in equity for the effective part, until the profit or loss is affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. The ineffective part of the cash flow hedge is recognized in the income statement. 2.10 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes expenditures for materials acquired, directly attributable costs and related production overhead expenses. Net realizable value is determined using the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Allowances are made for obsolete inventory. 2.12 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. The cost of replacing a part of a plant or equipment is capitalized if the 140 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements recognition criteria are met. Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets: · Freehold land is not depreciated; · Buildings: 20 to 50 years; · Computer equipment: three years; · Furniture and laboratory equipment: five years; and · Leasehold improvements: the shorter of the lease term and ten years. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement. The assets residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year-end. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added to the cost of these assets until they are substantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are those assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be completed for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the income statement when incurred. 2.13 Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired are measured at cost on initial recognition. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized if the recognition requirements are not met, in which case the expenses associated with generating the intangible asset are recognized in the income statement. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. The amortization period and the amortization method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, and treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the income statement consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The estimated useful life of the assets is as follows: · Patents and licenses: one year to 20 years; · Customer lists: three years; · Developed technology: five years to 20 years; and · In-process R&D is not depreciated until completion of the asset. 2.14 Goodwill and business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. This involves recognizing identifiable assets (including previously unrecognized intangible assets) and liabilities (including contingent liabilities, but excluding future restructuring) of the acquired business at fair value. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost, which is the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill includes intangible assets that were identified in a business combination, but not valued separately because the assets were either not separable or could not be measured reliably. Assets identified and included as part of goodwill can be specific customer relationships or supply contracts not meeting the requirements for separate recognition and the workforce acquired. Assigning fair values to the assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination inherently requires the use of estimates. Under IFRS 3 Business Combinations, these fair values can be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition date, which can affect the amount recognized as goodwill. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated from the acquisition date to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units. 141 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and, if necessary, translated into Euro at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 2.15 Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses non-financial assets at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the assets recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset shall be increased to its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. 2.16 Employee benefits Pensions The Group operates both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. For defined contribution plans, obligations for contributions are recognized as an expense when they are due. The Group has no obligation to pay further contributions into a defined contribution plan if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all plan benefits. Under defined benefit plans, the pension entitlements are calculated using the projected unit credit actuarial method. The pension liability recognized in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets after adding or subtracting unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and past-service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and any unrecognized past-service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. For each plan the recognized assets are limited to the net total of any cumulative unrecognized net actuarial losses and past-service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan (the asset ceiling). The economic benefit available as a reduction in future contributions is determined as the present value of the estimated future service cost in each year less the estimated minimum funding contributions required in respect of the future accrual of benefits in that year. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of a threshold of the higher of 10% of the pension liabilities and 10% of the fair value of the plan assets are charged or credited to the income statement over the employees expected average remaining working lives. Share-based payment transactions Stock option plans The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which the options are granted. 142 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The maximum amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions. The impact of market conditions on the fair value of options under these plans is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model. The model calculates the likelihood of achievement of the market-based measures at various levels. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the vesting date). The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period with the offsetting entry recorded in share premium in equity. Every option that is exercised results in the issuance of one ordinary share. At each balance sheet date, the estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-marketing vesting conditions are revised. The Group recognizes the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Share based incentive plans The fair value of share grants is estimated on the date of grant by multiplying the number of shares available to be granted by the fair value of the Companys shares on the grant date. Management assumes any performance goals required by the incentive plan will be achieved and the award will vest in full. Options granted to non-employees The cost of options granted to non-employees is recognized at the fair value of the goods or services received, together with a corresponding increase in equity, unless that fair value of the goods or services received cannot be estimated reliably, in which case the fair value is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. 2.17 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Short-term financial liabilities consist of all liabilities with maturities up to one year. Long-term financial liabilities are liabilities with maturities over one year. All loans and borrowings are initially recognized at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognized in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the amortization process. A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation underlying the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired. 2.18 Provisions Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, provisions are discounted. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a financial expense. 2.19 Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. Capitalized leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or, over the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will own the leased property by the end of the lease term. 143 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Leases where the Group does not assume substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases, and are recognized as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 3 Financial risk management 3.1 Risk management policies Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and security price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Groups overall financial risk management seeks to minimize potential adverse effects resulting from the unpredictability of financial markets on the Groups financial performance. The Group has policies in place that describe the goals of the Groups financial risk management. The adherence to these policies is monitored by corporate treasury. The goals of the Groups corporate treasury function are to reduce the currency exposures in the income statement, optimize return on investments in cash deposits, provide financing services to the business and monitor the financial risks relating to the Groups operations. The Group has specific operating procedures that prescribe the working practice on relevant specific financial risk management topics such as use of derivative financial instruments, investment of excess liquidity, centralization of cash, balance sheet position forecast procedures and authorization levels. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risk exposures. Corporate Treasury is responsible for using derivatives to mitigate foreign exchange risk arising from anticipated transactions and recognized monetary positions. Corporate treasury does this in close co-operation with the Groups subsidiaries. During the year 2008, the Group adopted a more proactive approach in hedging foreign currency exposures on monetary positions and forecasted transactions. In 2008, the Group applied for the first time formal hedge accounting to address specific economic exposures. Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The Group does not have a target debt-to-equity ratio. Although the Group entered into new finance leases and a new loan, the Group is committed to funding the majority of its operations with equity. The Group may choose to renew any loan that becomes payable. As part of its overall working capital management efforts, the Group agreed with Novartis to extend payment terms on the supply of Quinvaxem antigens. These transactions are secured by identified assets of the Company. In specific cases, the Group makes use of factoring arrangements to manage the cash flow on outstanding trade accounts receivable. The capital structure of the Group consists of financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognized, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2. 3.2 Foreign currency risk The Group divides the foreign currency risk into categories of transaction exposure, economic exposure and translation exposure. The Group defines transaction exposure as the foreign currency exposure arising on monetary positions and forecasted transactions in the coming month that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the group company. The Group has significant transactional currency exposures as the majority of the Groups sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting subsidiaries. 144 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Specifically, movements in the US Dollar/ Euro exchange rate affect the results of operations because a significant portion of sales are denominated in US Dollars. The Groups operating procedures require group companies to manage the foreign exchange risks against their functional currency. The target is to minimize foreign currency results on balance sheet items. Corporate treasury may hedge any remaining foreign exchange risk exposure on balance sheet positions. The Group defines economic exposure as the foreign currency exposure to which the Group committed itself. This is the exposure associated with the time delay between entering into a contract, budget or forecast and the realization thereof. It is not the Groups policy to actively manage these exposures, but rather to hedge economic exposure on a selective basis by managements decision. The Group may apply formal hedge accounting in mitigating these risks. The translation exposure is the exposure that arises on the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries with different functional currencies into Euro. The Group has operations in Switzerland, Korea, Sweden and the US, which all have a different functional currency than the Euro. Consequently, movements in the currencies of these countries against the Euro will affect the results of operations because the balance sheet and the income statement of these subsidiaries are translated into Euro. The Group does not actively hedge its translation exposure. Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to US Dollar, Swiss Franc, Korean Won, Swedish Crown and Australian Dollar. The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% strengthening of these currencies. The sensitivity analysis includes outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation as at December 31, 2008 for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. A positive amount indicates an increase in income before income tax and equity. For a 10% weakening of the foreign currencies against the Euro, there would be approximately an equal and opposite effect on the income before income tax and equity. The sensitivities disclosed above are representative for the second half of 2008 as the Group applied in that period a more proactive approach on hedging of transaction exposures and also applied formal hedge accounting. The revaluation effects of investments in foreign entities are recognized in equity. As we have significant operations denominated in other currencies than the Euro, the movements of currency exchange rates show a significant effect on equity. It is the Groups policy to limit the currency effects through the income statement. The Group does not proactively manage the currency exposure on the Groups equity. 3.3 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risks as a result of changes in the market interest rates compared to loans with fixed rates. The Group has several loans with fixed interest rates, which total  39,896 (2007:  45,795). The Group has financial liabilities of  20,855 with a variable interest rate as at December 31, 2008. Details on the interest rates and maturity of these loans are provided in note 5.19. The Group has cash balances of  183,865 of which 12,896 is restricted. (2007:  177,644 of which 14,396 is restricted.) There are no other receivables that generate interest. The cash balances, including restricted cash, are either variable or fixed for a maximum period of 3 months. 2008 2007 2006 Impact on Impact on Impact on income Impact on income Impact on income statement equity statement equity statement US Dollar 229 482 1,876 517 321 Swiss Franc (373 ) 17,980 (4,950 ) 19,706 (1,180 ) Korean Won (133 ) 8,414 860 8,055 1,113 Swedish Crown (538 ) 2,924 (486 ) 3,825 (33 ) Australian dollar 5 808 882   145 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period. The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates on the Groups profit/ (loss) before tax would be a positive result of  947 (2007:  1,100; 2006:  1,152). For a 1% decrease in interest rates there would be approximately an equal and opposite effect on the profit/ (loss) before tax. A change in the interest rate does not have an impact on the equity of the Group. The positive effect of a 1% increase of interest on profit/ (loss) before tax is mainly attributable to the Groups interest income generating assets, which are higher than its interest bearing liabilities. 3.4 Credit risk Credit risk represents the risk of financial loss caused by default of the counterparty. The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits and trade and other receivables. These represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade accounts receivable and other receivables. The Group normally trades only with recognized, credit-worthy third parties. It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. Where considered appropriate, the Group requires issuance of letters of credit to mitigate credit risk. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and the Group tracks the payment history of its customers to identify any payment issues that have to be resolved before entering into any new transactions. Allowances are recognized for receivable balances deemed uncollectible upon identification. In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers changes in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The customer base consists mainly of well-respected companies in the field of medicine and non-governmental organizations. In 2008, the Group has not encountered significant adverse events as a result of the weak global economy. While the Group does have concentrations of trade accounts receivable outstanding to supranational organizations, management has determined the risk of default by these organizations to be limited and therefore considers the credit risk to be within acceptable boundaries. Management believes that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents, and short-term deposits is diversed as the counterparties are numerous major financial institutions. Furthermore the Group currently only invests in liquid securities and money market transactions. Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The carrying value of these financial assets represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk. The maximum exposure at December 31, 2008 amounted to  242,206 (2007:  248,850). 3.5 Security price risk The Groups security price risk is limited to its investment in Galapagos valued at  4,922 (2007:  10,009), which is classified as an available-for-sale investment. The fair value is based on the market quotation of Galapagos. The Group does not actively trade in available-for-sale investments. Security price risk sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to the security price risks at the reporting date. If the Galapagos share price had been 10% higher/lower: · The profit for the year ended 31 December 2008 would have been unaffected as the investments are classified as available-for-sale and no investments were disposed of or impaired; and · Net unrealized gains reserve would increase/ decrease by  492 (2007: increase/decrease by  1,001) for the Group as a result of the changes in the fair value of the available-for-sale investment. The Groups sensitivity to security prices did not change significantly from the prior year. 146 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3.6 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk represents the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. Prudent liquidity risk management implies ensuring sufficient availability of cash resources for funding of the operations. The Group aims to maintain a solid cash base. The current liquidity risk is considered to be limited because the Group has sufficient funding to meet its obligations in the foreseeable future. Reference is made to note 5.19 Short and long-term financial liabilities for an analysis of the most significant financial liabilities. The Group has a total cash balance of  170,969 as at December 31, 2008 (2007:  163,248). 3.7 Financial instruments by category Financial assets In thousands of Euro 2008 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Loans and receivables Available- for-sale financial assets 2008 Total 2007 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Loans and receivables Available- for-sale financial assets 2007 Total Derivative financial instruments 1,761   1,761 29   29 Investment Galapagos   4,922 4,922   10,009 10,009 Other financial assets  14,920  14,920  16,153  16,153 Cash and cash equivalents  170,969  170,969  163,248  163,248 Trade accounts receivable  40,108  40,108  47,563  47,563 Other current assets  9,526  9,526  11,848  11,848 Total 1,761 235,523 4,922 242,206 29 238,812 10,009 248,850 The carrying value of the financial assets approximates the fair value.

The fair values of the loans have been calculated by discounting the face values with the interest rate of financial instruments with a similar risk profile and term. The fair values of the forward exchange contracts were calculated making use of the spot rate of the underlying exchange rates as at December 31, 2008. 147 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3.8 Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments for the management of foreign currency risks. 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 Fair value Fair value Total fair Fair value Fair value Total fair assets liabilities value assets liabilities value Foreign exchange contracts 1,761 (194 ) 1,567 29 (16 ) 13 Cash flow hedge  (685 ) (685 )    Total derivative financial instruments 1,761 (879 ) 882 29 (16 ) 13 All derivative financial instruments mature within a year and are therefore presented as current assets or liabilities. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange rates. All foreign exchange contracts, which are not designated as a qualifying hedge instrument, mature within 2 months after balance sheet date. The principal amount and fair value of foreign currency forwards that are not designated in a cash flow hedge are  38,907 in 2008 (2007:  nil) and a positive unrealized result of  1,567 in 2008 (2007:  13). The Group enters in these derivative transactions to mitigate its foreign currency transaction exposure. Cash flow hedging The Group has designated certain qualifying derivative financial instruments as hedge instruments for cash flow hedge accounting to manage its currency risk resulting from specific contracts denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the functional currency of the Group company that engages in the contract. The principal amount and fair value of foreign currency forwards designated in a cash flow hedge are respectively  7,535 (2007:  nil) and a negative unrealized result of  685 (2007:  nil). Cash flow hedges of foreign currency risks relate to forecasted transactions. These are expected to occur between 4 and 9 months after the balance sheet date. As at year-end 2008 the outstanding cash flow hedge was estimated to be 100% effective. No amounts were removed or reclassed from the hedge reserve during the period to non-financial balance sheet items or to the income statement. The Group did not engage in hedge accounting prior to 2008. 3.9 Off balance sheet transactions The Group has the following off-balance sheet transactions, in addition to the guarantees given on assets as described in 5.6 property, plant and equipment and 5.19 Short and long-term financial liabilities. Guarantees The Group has a guarantee facility for an amount of  10.0 million with a third-party bank. As part of the overall working capital management efforts, the Group agreed with Novartis to extend payment terms on the supply of Quinvaxem antigens. We have provided Novartis with collateral on our Swiss premises for an amount up to  22,847. Total guarantees issued by the Group amount to  3.1 million, which included a letter of credit issued by the Group for an amount of $ 1.6 million which will expire on April 14, 2013 for the benefit of the Percivia Development Center. Covenants Some of the Groups arrangements with financial institutions are subject to covenant clauses, whereby the Group is required to maintain certain cash thresholds. The Group did not breach any of these covenant clauses in 2008 nor does the Group foresee any breaches of these covenants in the foreseeable future. 148 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 4 Segment information 4.1 General The Group operates in one reportable segment, which comprises the development, production and marketing of products that combat infectious diseases. The Group early adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments, which replaces IAS 14, Segment reporting, as of January 1, 2007. The Group identified the Management Board as the chief operating decision maker. The Management Board reviews the consolidated operating results regularly to make decisions about resources and to assess overall performance. In 2007, the Groups segmentation was based on the two segments that were reported to our Management Board: · Vaccines: developing, producing and marketing vaccines worldwide to combat infectious diseases; · Proteins: leverage Crucells novel, proprietary technologies to develop monoclonal antibodies to combat infectious diseases. In 2008, the Management Board decided to integrate both business units and reduce the complexity of our organization. In 2008, the separate segments were no longer reported to the Management Board. 4.2 Information about major products The breakdown of the Groups revenues from its product sales was as follows: In thousands of Euro Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Paediatric vaccines 111,039 77,371 35,933 Respiratory vaccines 32,474 33,188 40,386 Travel vaccines 55,572 47,282 23,072 Other vaccines 8,907 10,705 2,998 Proteins and other business 18,063 9,023 1,529 226,055 177,569 103,918 4.3 Information about major customers In 2008, sales to our two largest customers, which are in the paediatric vaccines area, amounted to  85,142 or 37.6% and  18,390 or 8.1% of net product sales. In 2007, sales to these customers accounted for  45,480 or 25.6% and  23,457 or 13.2% of net product sales, respectively. 4.4 Geographical segments The Group operates principally in three geographical areas: Europe, North America and Asia. Segment revenue is based on the geographical location of the customers, which is the billing location of the customers. Segmentation of the assets is based on the geographical location of the assets.

In 2008, a deferred tax asset of  8,585 was recognized for carry forward losses of Berna Biotech AG, which were previously unrecognized due to lack of evidence of future taxable income. At the end of the year the total deferred tax assets for carry forward losses amounted to  9,060. 151 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The Group has unrecognized tax carry forward losses of  172,732 (2007:  254,511; 2006:  222,238) that are available, with certain restrictions in time, for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. The Group reached an agreement with the Dutch tax authorities to retroactively change the valuation of our intellectual property, to avoid the evaporation of unrecognized tax carry forward losses. This agreement allows the Group to recognize  72,000 of our intellectual property as assets for tax purposes. In the Netherlands anti-abuse laws may limit our ability to realize certain tax carry forward losses for an amount up to  26,170. The unrecognized carry forward losses expire as follows: 2011 17,502 2012 21,164 2013 19,153 After 2013 113,966 Unlimited 947 Total 172,732 Tax rate changes In Korea, the tax holiday granted by the government is decreasing over time. In financial years 2008 and 2009, the applicable tax rate is 16.5%. As of 2010 the tax rate will be the regular statutory income tax rate of 22.0%. As of the year 2012 we will benefit from a tax holiday related to our investment in the Incheon, Free Economic Zone, which will significantly reduce the effective Korean income tax rate for a period of 5 years. The reduced expected realization rate for our deferred tax liabilities in Korea resulted in a taxation gain of  3,384. The Swedish domestic statutory corporate income tax rate amounted to 28.0% in 2008 and will decrease to 26.3% in 2009. The Spanish domestic statutory corporate income tax rate amounted to 32.5% in 2007 and was decreased to 28.0% in 2008. The rate will also be 28.0% in 2009 and thereafter. 5.5 Profit/ (loss) per share In thousands of Euro 2008 2007 2006 Net profit/ (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders 14,586 (42,910 ) (86,946 ) Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the year 65,593,374 65,102,801 57,064,034 Dilutive effect share options 721,682   Weighted average number of ordinary shares for diluted net profit/ (loss) for the year 66,315,056 65,102,801 57,064,034 Net profit/ (loss) per share  basic 0.22 (0.66 ) (1.52 ) Net profit/(loss) per share  diluted 0.22 (0.66 ) (1.52 ) 152 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 5.6 Property, plant and equipment Amounts in thousands of Euro Freehold Assets Land and Plant and under Cost buildings equipment construction Total At January 1, 2007 69,747 75,090 34,298 179,135 Additions 245 5,913 20,998 27,156 Disposals (147 ) (995 )  (1,142 ) Effect of movements in exchange rates (4,238 ) (5,299 ) (412 ) (9,949 ) At December 31, 2007 65,607 74,709 54,884 195,200 Additions 66 7,917 7,804 15,787 Disposals  (1,620 )  (1,620 ) Transfer assets under construction 66 35,204 (35,270 )  Effect of movements in exchange rates 5,456 2,450 1,886 9,792 At December 31, 2008 71,195 118,660 29,304 219,159 Depreciation and impairment At January 1, 2007 (12,366 ) (28,751 )  (41,117 ) Depreciation charge for the year (4,490 ) (9,963 )  (14,453 ) Impairment (171 )   (171 ) Disposals 144 935  1,079 Effect of movements in exchange rates 2,105 2,882  4,987 At December 31, 2007 (14,778 ) (34,897 )  (49,675 ) Depreciation charge for the year (6,715 ) (9,914 )  (16,629 ) Impairment (266 ) (65 )  (331 ) Reversal of impairment 5,219   5,219 Disposals  1,498  1,498 Effect of movements in exchange rates (3,526 ) (4,509 )  (8,035 ) At December 31, 2008 (20,066 ) (47,887 )  (67,953 ) Net book value At December 31, 2008 51,129 70,773 29,304 151,206 At December 31, 2007 50,829 39,812 54,884 145,525 Depreciation is included in the cost of goods sold for an amount of  10,026 in 2008 (2007:  11,176, 2006:  8,995), research and development costs of  4,157 in 2008 (2007:  2,353, 2006:  4,448) and selling, general and administrative costs of  2,446 in 2008 (2007:  924, 2006: 832).

During 2006 the remaining outstanding shares were also acquired. Berna Biotech was a fully integrated biotechnology company that marketed numerous vaccines on a global scale. · In October 2006, the Company purchased, via its subsidiary Crucell Vaccines Inc. the assets and liabilities of the Florida-based Berna Products Corp. (BPC) from Acambis plc for  13,806. BPC was originally established in 1990 by Berna Biotech to market Vivotif, Bernas oral typhoid fever vaccine, in the US and Canada and was acquired by Acambis plc in 2003. · In November 2006, the Group acquired the shares of Stockholm-based SBL Vaccin Holding AB (SBL) from 3i and SEB for a total consideration of  39,341 in cash. SBL is a fully integrated independent Swedish biotechnology company employing 120 people. SBLs main product was Dukoral. In addition, SBL has a sales and distribution organization for vaccines in Scandinavia. The selling shareholders of SBL Vaccin acquisition Holding AB are contractually entitled to earn-out payments based on contingent future events. In 2008, additional consideration resulting from the earn-out agreement with the former shareholders was treated as an adjustment to the cost of the business combination for an amount of  237. This contingent consideration was not recognized in the prior year because the amount could not be measured reliably. Goodwill allocation to cash-generating units Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated as follows: In thousands of Euro December 31, 2008 2007 Vaccines segment  44,377 2006 business acquisitions 46,076  Total goodwill 46,076 44,377 In 2008, the Group reorganized its reporting structure in a way that changed the composition of one or more cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated, as the Vaccines and the Proteins business units were integrated. In 2007, all goodwill was allocated to the Vaccines Unit. As a result of the change in composition of the reporting structure, all goodwill was allocated to the businesses acquired in 2006 on a combined basis. Calculations of the recoverable amount show that there is no impairment as the recoverable amount of the 2006 business acquisitions exceeds the carrying amount by  189 million. Sensitivities to changes in assumptions Management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would not decrease the value in use to the extent that the related goodwill would exceed the recoverable amount. Several sensitivity analyses on key assumptions were performed and the outcome indicated that the carrying amount would not exceed the recoverable amount. Reference is made to the key assumptions below as these have a significant impact on the calculated recoverable amount: · The recoverable goodwill amount was determined on the basis of a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 15.2%. A higher WACC percentage would reduce the recoverable amount; · In the valuation model, future investments for enhancements/ improvements for which preparations are ongoing, have been included in the analysis; and 155 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements · The valuation is based on a discounted future cash flow model with a 5-year window and a terminal value after the last planning year in 2013. The terminal value has been set at 50%.The 50% reduction in the terminal value is to reflect that there are no new products available without significant investments for biotechnology companies. 5.9 Investments in associates and joint ventures 5.9.1 Associated companies ADImmune Corp., Taiwan The Group has an 11.8% stake in the share capital of Taiwan-based ADImmune Corp., (ADImmune) a company that develops, manufactures and distributes vaccines and other biological products. During 2008, our ownership of ADImmune Corp. was diluted from 20% to 11.8%. ADImmune will use Crucells virosome technology to produce a virosomal adjuvanted influenza vaccine for the following specified markets: Taiwan, Japan and Macau. Additionally, ADImmune will produce influenza antigen in the future, which we may purchase to produce our influenza vaccine product, Inflexal V. Summary financial information of ADImmune for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, not adjusted for the percentage of ownership held by the Group is as follows: In thousands of Euro 2008 2007 Associates balance sheet (ADImmune) Current assets 21,781 6,621 Non-current assets 70,737 38,447 Current liabilities (6,259 ) (4,918 ) Non-current liabilities (16,821 ) (209 ) Net assets 69,438 39,941 Associate revenues and expenses Revenues and other income 5,844 5,056 Expenses (6,548 ) (6,108 ) Profit/ (loss) for the period (704 ) (1,052 ) Kenta Biotech AG, Switzerland On July 3, 2008, the Group sold all of the 2,625,000 shares it owned in Kenta Biotech AG to Ingro Finanz AG. Prior to this sale, our ownership interest had already been diluted from 37% in 2006 to 22% by the end of 2007. We realized an accounting gain of  1,570 on the sale. Pevion Biotech AG, Switzerland Pevion Biotech AG develops vaccines based on its proprietary technology platforms. In November 2007, the Group sold all 2.9 million shares it owned in Pevion Biotech AG for  6,081 to the other Pevion Biotech shareholders. The Group realized an accounting gain of  2,186 on the sale. 5.9.2 Joint ventures Percivia LLC, United States In August 2006, DSM Pharmaceutical Products Inc, and the Group established a joint venture, Percivia LLC (Percivia) to operate the PERCIVIA PER.C6 Development Center in Cambridge, MA, US. Each company holds 50% of the shares. The intial contribution amounts to $ 500. The joint venture further develops the PER.C6 cell line and provides a unique solution for the production of pharmaceutical proteins to licensees utilizing the PER.C6 human cell line in the biotech industry. Percivia recharges the costs incurred to the venturers. No additional fundings are planned. Summary financial information of this joint venture, not adjusted for the percentage ownership held by the Group is as follows: In thousands of Euro 2008 2007 Joint Ventures balance sheet (Percivia) Current assets 2,060 1,131 Non-current assets 1,360 981 Current liabilities (1,440 ) (965 ) Non-current liabilities   Net assets 1,980 1,147 Joint Ventures revenues and expenses Revenues 8,721 8,081 Expenses (7,972 ) (7,348 ) Profit/ (loss) for the period 749 733 The tax charge for PERCIVIA PER.C6 Development Center is accounted for in the financial statements of the venturers. The tax charge recognized in the financial statements relating to the percentage owned by the Group amounts to  151 in 2008 (2007:  146). 156 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 5.10 Retirement benefit obligations The Group provides employee benefit plans to most of its employees by means of various pension plans. These plans comply with local regulations and practices in the countries in which they operate and differ based on legal requirements, tax legislation, local customs and economic conditions in those countries. While the nature of the plans varies by country, in general, the benefits provided depend on remuneration and years of service. Most of these benefits are administrated by insurance companies or pension funds. The Group adopted IFRIC 14, IAS 19  The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interactions in 2008. The interpretation provides guidance on assessing the limit of the surplus in a defined benefit pension plan that can be recognized as an asset. It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement. The pension fund in Switzerland has a minimum funding requirement and the application of the interpretation resulted in an increase in the assets recorded on the Groups balance sheet of  7,853 (2007:  4,918, 2006:  746) and a corresponding increase in the Groups equity of  6,165 (2007:  3,861, 2006:  586), which includes a net tax effect of  1,688 (2007:  1,057, 2006:  160). The result for the year increased by  2,101 (2007:  3,037, 2006:  367) as a result of the application of IFRIC 14. As required by IFRS, all comparative figures were adjusted retrospectively as if the interpretation had always been applied. Also see 1.5 Changes in accounting policies.

After the acquisitions in 2006, the Group operates defined benefit plans in Switzerland, Korea and Sweden. The pension asset of  8,612 (2007:  7,397) relates to the Swiss pension fund while the pension liability of  2,710 (2008:  3,466) relates to the Swedish and the Korean pension funds. In total, 97% (2007: 96%) of the plan assets and 91% (2007: 90%) of the defined benefit obligation relate to the Swiss pension fund. The weighted average of the principal assumptions used in determining the employee benefit obligations for the defined benefit plans of the Group are shown below: In percent 2008 2007 2006 Discount rate 3.37% 3.40% 3.32% Expected return on plan assets 4.53% 4.53% 4.55% Future salary increases 1.19% 1.22% 1.19% Future pension increases 0.71% 0.78% 0.66% Changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations, funding requirements and periodic costs incurred. The Group consults at least annually with external actuaries regarding these assumptions. Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: In thousands of Euro Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Opening defined benefit obligation, January 1, (74,506 ) (72,679 ) Interest cost (2,165 ) (2,363 ) Current service cost (3,748 ) (3,369 ) Benefits paid 4,418 2,450 Actuarial gains/(losses) (3,038 ) (934 ) Exchange differences (6,446 ) 2,389 Closing defined benefit obligation (85,485 ) (74,506 ) 157 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: In thousands of Euro 2008 2007 Opening fair value of plan assets 99,032 102,306 Expected return on plan assets 4,606 4,528 Contributions by employer 597 2,338 Contributions by participants 1,053 984 Benefits paid (4,062 ) (2,208 ) Actuarial gains/(losses) (9,213 ) (5,727 ) Exchange differences 9,555 (3,189 ) Fair value of plan assets, December 31 101,568 99,032 In 2009, the Group expects to contribute an amount similar to the amount contributed in 2007 to its defined benefit pension plans.

As of December 31, 2008, there were 65,833,242 ordinary shares issued and outstanding (2007: 65,348,796). No preference shares are issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2008. On October 25, 2000, the Company established a foundation called Stichting Preferente Aandelen Crucell, also referred to as the Preferred Foundation. The Preferred Foundations object is to safeguard the interests of Crucell, its business and parties connected therewith by blocking any influences that may threaten these interests, which interests may include the continuity, independence or identity of Crucell, its business and parties connected therewith. The Preferred Foundation can safeguard these interests through acquiring and managing the preference shares and by exercising the rights attaching to these shares, in particular, the voting rights. The agreement between the Company and the Preferred Foundation grants an option to the Preferred Foundation to acquire preference shares up to 100% of the number of our outstanding shares as necessary to match the total number of statutory votes on all of the ordinary shares outstanding at the time of an acquisition. The Preferred Foundation must pay at least 25% of the nominal value of the preference shares it acquires from the Company. If the Company has previously acquired any preference shares, they may be cancelled. A board of governors of up to five persons directs the Preferred Foundation. Mr. J. P. Oosterveld, in his capacity as chairman of our Supervisory Board, and Mr. P. Bouw, Mr. M. W. den Boogert, Mr. S. van Wijnbergen and Mr. G. P. Krans, have been appointed to the board of governors. A majority of these members may not be members or former members of the Management or Supervisory Board of the Company, or an employee of any of our advisers, any of our banks or us. The board of governors appoints these independent members. The Supervisory Board appoints the non-independent members after consultation with the Management Board.

The compensation expenses included in operating expenses for those plans were  5,053,  6,524 and  4,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In December 2004, the Supervisory Board approved a new option plan (the 2005 Plan) providing for the grant of stock options to non-Management Committee members. Options granted under this stock option plan are exercisable once vested. Granted options vest straight line over a period of four years. Compensation costs are recognized in accordance with the accelerated method. 160 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The options expire five years after date of grant. Upon termination of employment with Crucell, options must be exercised within 90 days. Options granted under the stock option plan are granted at exercise prices, which equal the fair value of the ordinary shares of the Company at the date of grant. All options granted under previous stock option plans (the Prior Plans) are exercisable immediately upon grant. The options expire four to eight years from the date of grant, or earlier upon termination of employment with the Group. Upon termination of employment, options must be exercised within 90 days. No further grants are to be made under the Prior Plans. At the annual General Meeting of Shareholders in 2008, the shareholders of the Company approved the revised long-term incentive (LTI) plan for the Management Board. Under the terms of the LTI plan, options are conditionally granted and vest at the end of a four-year performance period. The conditionally granted options include a market condition that is taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. The number of LTI options that vest are based on the fulfilment of the LTI performance condition. On the vesting date, Crucells Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance is measured against the performance of the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index during the performance period. The positive difference in percentages, if any, between Crucells TSR compared to the performance of the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index, determines the number of LTI options that vest on the vesting date. Depending on the level of achievement of these market measures, at the end of three years, the number of shares vesting could be 0%-200% of the number of options originally granted. The new LTI plan will impact the Groups results for the first time in 2009. At the annual General Meeting of Shareholders in 2008, the shareholders of the Company approved an additional option grant to the Management Board of 800.000 options. The options are conditionally granted and vest at the end of a three-year performance period starting June 2, 2008. The conditionally granted options include a market condition that is taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. The market condition is an absolute total shareholder return of plus 50% share value measured three years after the grant.The Group accounts for its employee stock options under the fair value method. The fair value of options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted average assumptions: In percent Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate 4.3% 4.1% 3.6% Expected dividend yield    Expected volatility 36.7% 33.3% 41.8% Expected life (years) 4.76 4.25 4.25 The risk-free interest rate is based on Dutch treasury securities in effect at the time of grant. In determining the expected volatility, we take into account the historical volatility of the Companys stock over a period commensurate with the expected term of the employee stock options. When establishing the expected life, we take into account the contractual term of the options and historical employee exercise behaviour. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was  4.03,  5.34 and  6.96, respectively. A summary of the stock option activity for the outstanding plans is as follows: Weighted average Number of exercise options price Balance at January 1, 2006 4,029,504 6.43 Granted 953,466 18.76 Exercised (1,284,655 ) 4.16 Forfeited (12,875 ) 19.40 Balance at December 31, 2006 3,685,440 10.36 Granted 1,514,165 16.97 Exercised (301,475 ) 6.45 Forfeited (237,447 ) 19.15 Balance at December 31, 2007 4,660,683 12.31 Granted 2,639,640 11.59 Exercised (420,270 ) 7.58 Forfeited (592,175 ) 16.55 Balance at December 31, 2008 6,287,878 11.92 Included in the options outstanding as of December 31, 2008 are also options to acquire ordinary shares held by certain former employees and consultants. These individuals have been permitted to continue vesting in these options for services rendered. 161 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The following table summarizes information about the companys stock options outstanding at December 31, 2008: Weighted Weighted Outstanding Weighted average average options at average remaining exercise price- December 31, exercise contractual Excercisable exercisable Exercise price 2008 price life (years) options options 2.35   5.00 516,125 3.34 2.12 516,125 3.34 5.00   9.99 1,689,724 8.19 2.22 1,223,104 7.74 10.00   14.99 2,677,125 12.45 4.34 247,625 12.74 15.00   19.99 1,193,031 18.20 2.92 452,483 17.91 20.00   22.22 211,873 20.42 2.19 113,970 20.50 Total 6,287,878 11.92 3.24 2,553,307 9.71 As of December 31, 2008, a total of 9,874,986 ordinary shares, representing 15% (2007: 15%) of the issued share capital, has been reserved for issuance under the option plan, of which 6,287,878 (2007: 4,660,683) were subject to outstanding options. Share-based incentive plans In addition to the employee stock option plans for executives as described in the previous paragraph, the Company operated incentive plans for executives up to 2008 that involved the issuance of share awards. Up to 2008, the Group operated the 2005 Short-term Incentive Plan (the STI Plan). Crucell granted executives share awards with vesting contingent upon meeting various company-wide, departmental and individual performance goals. The employees granted shares under the STI Plan were allowed to elect to receive either cash (at a 25% discount from the total award) or shares if certain performance criteria were met. Grants under the STI Plan were accounted for as liabilities and included in accrued compensation and related benefits in the accompanying balance sheets. In 2007, executives were entitled to a total of 15,544 STI Plan shares, after deduction of income tax. Shares granted under the STI Plan were issued to the executives in the first quarter of 2008. No more issuances under this STI plan can take place. At the annual General Meeting of Shareholders in 2008, the shareholders approved the 2008, STI cash-based payment plan and this supersedes the 2005 STI share-based payment plan. Up to 2008, the Group operated the 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan (the LTI Plan), which allowed for the issuance of up to 36,842 shares of common stock to be granted to executives with vesting contingent upon meeting various performance conditions. Depending on the level of achievement of these market measures, at the end of three years, the number of shares vesting could be 0%-200% of the number of shares originally allowed for issuance. In 2008, a total of 20,104 shares was granted under the terms of the 2005 LTI plan. No more issuances under this LTI plan can take place. At the annual General Meeting of Shareholders in 2008, the shareholders approved the 2008 LTI option-based payment plan as described above and this supersedes the 2005 LTI share-based payment plan. Stock option grants to non-employees Crucell has a total number of 67,604 (2007: 67,604) stock options to various non-employees outstanding in connection with consulting agreements over the years. The exercise prices range from  5.38 to  18.22 per share and the stock options expire on dates ranging from May 2010 through August 2012. During 2008, the Company issued no stock options to non-employees. The Company recorded compensation expense associated with these stock options of  24,  11 and  295 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Stock option grants to non-employees are made pursuant to approved stock option plans and activity related thereto is included in the tables above with the employee grants of the approved plans. 162 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 5.18 Provisions, commitments and contingencies In thousands of Euro Employee Restructuring Litigation benefits Other Total At January 1, 2007 1,646 1,000 3,919 1,441 8,006 Arising during the year    657 657 Utilized (1,364 ) (77 )  (752 ) (2,193 ) Unused amounts reversed (276 ) (50 )  (290 ) (616 ) Movement defined benefit liability   (267 )  (267 ) Exchange adjustment (6 ) (18 ) (186 ) (43 ) (253 ) At December 31, 2007  855 3,466 1,013 5,334 Current 2007    761 761 Non-current 2007  855 3,466 252 4,573 At January 1, 2008  855 3,466 1,013 5,334 Arising during the year 684 705  626 2,015 Utilized (74 ) (2 )  (491 ) (567 ) Unused amounts reversed    (33 ) (33 ) Movement defined benefit liability   (204 )  (204 ) Exchange adjustment  90 (552 ) 75 (387 ) At December 31, 2008 610 1,648 2,710 1,190 6,158 Current 2008 610   971 1,581 Non-current 2008  1,648 2,710 219 4,577 Provisions Restructuring In 2008, a restructuring program in our Italian subsidiary Berna Biotech Italia Srl. was executed. A total provision of  684 was recognized of which  610 was outstanding as per year-end 2008. In 2006, a restructuring charge was recognized in relation to centralization of R&D functions in Leiden and phasing out R&D projects in Switzerland. The decision to concentrate R&D in Leiden was made to increase efficiency in R&D spending and resulted in a reduction in the number of staff employed, which was effectuated in the first quarter of 2007. Legal proceedings The Group is subject to certain lawsuits and other legal proceedings. The current status of any pending proceedings has been reviewed with legal counsel. Upon consideration of known relevant facts and circumstances, provisions are recognized for losses that are considered to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated at balance sheet date. Complaint filed by Korean landlord At the end of 2007, our Korean landlord advised us it would stop providing utilities to us in the near future and also filed a complaint against us seeking the removal of two additional buildings at the Korean facility and delivery to the landlord of the land on which those buildings are located. In October 2008, we reached an agreement to relocate our Korean production facility from the Shingal site in Yongin City to the Incheon, Free Economic Zone. All parties involved, including our current landlord, have agreed on the time line and conditions of this relocation, enabling a smooth transition to the new production facility. All litigation surrounding our existing Korean production facility has been settled. Deductibility of research and development costs In Italy, Berna Biotech Italia Srl. was subject to a tax audit for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. For the year 2001, a settlement was reached with the Italian tax authorities in 2007. For the year 2002, no settlement has been reached. The tax authorities issued an assessment that deviates from the amount that was filed in the tax return. We have challenged this assessment in court. We made a provision for the costs of additional taxes, penalties 163 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and interest, as well as lawyers fees, which we expect we would have to pay as a result. One of the items in dispute is the deductibility of the research and development costs we make in Italy. The Group won the initial court case with respect to the deductibility of the research and development costs. The Italian tax authorities appealed this decision. In 2008, the Italian tax authorities also challenged the deductibility of research and development costs for the year 2003 and issued an assessment. We will challenge this assessment in court. The Italian tax authorities may also challenge the deductibility of research and development costs for the years 2004 to 2008. As the Group considers it more likely than not that the research and development cost will be tax deductible, no additional provision was recognized for the deductibility of research and development costs. Complaint against government grant awarded In 2008, a competitor of Crucell filed a protest against the award of a government grant to Crucell for the development and manufacture of a vaccine against the Ebola and Marburg virus. The complaint was filed against the US. Government but Crucell voluntarily joined the proceedings to defend the award. Following a dismissal of the protest by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), the competitor filed an appeal which is currently pending before the Court of Appeal of the Federal Circuit (CAFC). Employee benefits Further reference is made to retirement benefit obligations. See note 5.10. Other Other provisions mainly relate to asset retirement obligations and warranties. Commitments and contingencies Contingent liability STAR technology The Group acquired STAR technology in 2004 through the purchase of ChromaGenics B.V., a privately held biotechnology company based in Amsterdam. In connection with the purchase, we also entered in a contingent payment agreement that could result in additional payments of up to  7.0 million to former ChromaGenics shareholders upon receipt of revenues and royalties generated from the STAR technology. In connection with this agreement, we paid  2.0 million in 2007. The expense was recognized in the cost of goods sold. No payments were made in 2008. 5.19 Short and long-term financial liabilities This note provides information about the contractual terms of the Groups loans and borrowings.

In 2006, interest was accrued to the loan and no payments of principal or interest were required. Beginning January 1, 2007, the loan is being repaid through monthly payments over 15 years. A balloon repayment of  10,000 will be made at the end of the 15 years. The loan matures on December 31, 2021. The loan bears interest at 4.55% for the first five years. After this period the rates will be renegotiated. The land, building, part of the equipment and a compensating cash balance arrangement with a bank in the amount of  10,000 secure the loan. The carrying amount of the underlying secured assets was at the year-end  24,015 (2007:  26,946). Finance lease liabilities Finance leases mainly relate to equipment for the new production facility in Leiden. The vast majority of the finance lease liabilities are denominated in Euro. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and interest rates are fixed at the contract date. For further information see note 5.22. Comprehensive credit limit Berna Biotech Korea Corp. On June 12, 2008 Berna Biotech Korea Corp. entered into a comprehensive credit limit transaction agreement. Under the terms of the agreement Berna Biotech Korea Corp. may freely borrow and repay money for an amount of KRW 30 billion during the period ending on May 31, 2009. In December 2008, Berna Biotech Korea Corp. agreed on an additional facility for KRW 10 billion. The loan has a variable interest rate that is based on a Korean interest index plus a mark-up. As per year-end the interest percentage was 6.79% and an amount of KRW 37 billion ( 20,855) was drawn under the agreement. Loan Berna Biotech Korea Corp. Berna Biotech Korea Corp. had an unsecured Euro loan that bears interest at 5.45% which is outstanding as per December 31, 2008. The original maturity date of the loan was August 1, 2010, but the loan was repaid in full on February 2, 2009. Privately placed bond Berna Biotech Korea Corp. Berna Biotech Korea Corp (Berna Biotech Korea) issued a Korean Won denominated bond with an interest rate of 6.73%. The privately placed bond by Berna Biotech Korea Corp. was repaid on June 13, 2008. Factoring liabilities In December 2007, the Group factored trade accounts receivable for a total amount of  5,653 with an external party in Italy. The Group did not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the transferred trade accounts receivable, specifically the credit risk, and consequently the cash payments received are accounted for as a financial liability. No interest is charged on the factoring liabilities. 5.20 Other liabilities and deferred income  current and non-current In thousands of Euro 2008 2007 Current Non-current Total Current Non-current Total Deferred income 7,882 7,054 14,936 7,921 11,594 19,515 Accrued salary expenses and payroll taxes 9,817  9,817 10,318  10,318 Accrued expenses 8,540  8,540 14,684  14,684 Derivative financial instruments 879  879 16  16 Other liabilities 2,166 591 2,757 4,958 529 5,487 29,284 7,645 36,929 37,897 12,123 50,020 165 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 5.21 Trade accounts payables In thousands of Euro Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Trade accounts payables to third parties 58,182 50,638 Trade accounts payables to joint ventures 1,023 332 59,205 50,970 Trade accounts payables are generally paid under the payment terms, which vary by company and region.

Supervisory Board Due to the fact that Crucell operates on a global scale with many of its supervisory directors used to the international arena, Crucell offers compensation to its supervisory directors in accordance with customary practice in the biotechnology sector. From 2008 and onwards, compensation for all Supervisory Board members consists of a fixed fee in cash and an annual share grant. The fixed fee in cash ranges from  34 to  44 per Supervisory Board member. In addition, the chairman of the Supervisory Board is awarded annually a net allowance of  5 that is grossed up for taxation purposes. The annual share grant awarded to each member of the Supervisory Board shall equal 2,500 ordinary shares. The amounts will be revised on a triennial basis. The shares should be held for as long as an individual is a member of the Supervisory Board. Instead of the share grant, a Supervisory Board member may also choose to receive a cash amount equalling the value of 2,500 shares at the date of grant minus 25%.

The Companys articles of association provide that Crucells Management Board members and Crucells Supervisory Board members are discharged from liability for their actions as board members, if Crucells General Meeting of Shareholders adopts a resolution to that effect. This discharge extends only to actions or omissions disclosed in or apparent from the adopted annual accounts or otherwise communicated to the Companys General Meeting of Shareholders. Mandatory provisions of Dutch law may limit this discharge of liability, for example in the case of bankruptcy. Under Dutch law, the Companys Supervisory Board members and members of the Companys Management Board generally cannot be held personally liable for decisions made exercising their reasonable business judgment. The Companys articles of association provide that the Company shall generally indemnify any person who is or was a member of the Companys Supervisory Board or of the Companys Management Board or one of the Companys employees, officers or agents, and suffers any loss as a result of any action in connection with their service to the Company, provided they acted in good faith in carrying out their duties. This indemnification generally will not be available if the person seeking indemnification acted with gross negligence or wilful misconduct in the performance of his or her duties to the Company. A court in which an action is brought, may however determine that indemnification is appropriate nonetheless. 170 Financial Statements Company Financial Statements Company Financial Statements 6 Balance sheet (After appropriation of result) (Amounts in thousands of Euro) Notes 2008 2007 Assets Non-current assets Investments in subsidiaries 9.1 305,572 307,355 Other long-term receivables 9.2 49,272 87,680 354,844 395,035 Current assets Short-term receivables 1,015 2,175 Cash and cash equivalents 79,295 54,997 Short term receivables related parties 18,614  98,924 57,172 Total assets 453,768 452,207 Liabilities and shareholders equity Shareholders equity Issued capital 15,800 15,685 Share premium 743,746 735,578 Translation reserve (legal reserve) (33,026 ) (28,317 ) Hedge reserve (685 )  Available-for-sale reserve 3,254 8,340 Accumulated deficit (275,597 ) (290,183 ) 9.3 453,492 441,103 Non-current liabilities Liabilities to related parties 149 142 149 142 Current liabilities Accrued compensation and related benefits 122 927 Liability to related parties 5 10,035 127 10,962 Total liabilities and shareholders equity 453,768 452,207 7 Income statement In thousands of Euro For the year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Result from subsidiaries 4,019 (46,944 ) (89,598 ) Other income 10,567 4,034 2,652 Profit/(loss) for the year 14,586 (42,910 ) (86,946 ) 171 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements 8 General The description of the Groups activities and the Group structure as included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements also apply to the Company financial statements (see note 1.1).

Wilhelmsson S.Davis 174 Other Information Other information Appropriation of result Annual dividends may only be paid out of profits as shown in the adopted annual financial statements. We may not make distributions if the distribution would reduce our shareholders equity below certain reserves required by Dutch law or our articles of association. The profits must first be used to set up and maintain reserves required by Dutch law and must then be set off against certain financial losses. The preference shares will be paid their dividends first, which will be a certain percentage of their nominal value. With Supervisory Board approval, our Management Board then decides whether and how much of the remaining profit will be reserved. Any profits remaining shall be paid as a dividend on the ordinary shares. If the retained earnings are negative or are to be used to form a statutory reserve no dividend will be paid out. The profit for the year 2008 was added to the accumulated deficit. Preference shares On October 25, 2000, the Company established a foundation called Stichting Preferente Aandelen Crucell, also referred to as the Preferred Foundation. The Preferred Foundations object is to safeguard the interests of Crucell, its business and parties connected therewith by blocking any influences that may threaten these interests, which interests may include the continuity, independence or identity of Crucell, its business and parties connected therewith. The Preferred Foundation can safeguard the interests through acquiring and managing the preference shares and by exercising the rights attaching to these shares, in particular, the voting rights. The Preferred Foundation has an option to acquire preference shares up to 100% of the number of our outstanding shares, necessary to match the total number of statutory votes on all of the ordinary shares outstanding at the time of an acquisition. The Preferred Foundation must pay at least 25% ofthe nominal value of the preference shares it acquires from us. If we acquire any preference shares, they may be cancelled. A board of governors of up to five persons directs the Preferred Foundation. Mr. J.P. Oosterveld, in his capacity as chairman of our Supervisory Board, and Mr. P. Bouw, Mr. M.W. den Boogert, Mr. S. van Wijnbergen and Mr. G.P. Krans, have been appointed to the board of governors. A majority of these members may not be members or former members of our Management or Supervisory Board, or an employee of any of our advisers, any of our banks or us. The board of governors appoints these independent members. Our Supervisory Board appoints the non-independent members after consultation with our Management Board. 175 Other Information Auditors Report Auditors Report To the Supervisory Board and Shareholders of Crucell N.V., Leiden, The Netherlands Report on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2008 as set out on pages 125 to 174 of Crucell N.V., Leiden. The financial statements consist of the consolidated financial statements and the company financial statements. The consolidated financial statements comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2008, profit and loss account, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. The company financial statements comprise the company balance sheet as at December 31, 2008, the company profit and loss account for the year then ended and the explanatory notes. Managements responsibility Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code, and for the preparation of the management board report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditors responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law. This law requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion with respect to the consolidated financial statements In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Crucell N.V. as at December 31, 2008, and of its result and its cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. Opinion with respect to the company financial statements In our opinion, the company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Crucell N.V. as at December 31, 2008 and of its result for the year then ended in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Pursuant to the legal requirement under 2:393 sub 5 part f of the Netherlands Civil Code, we report, to the extent of our competence, that the management board report is consistent with the financial statements as required by 2:391 sub 4 of the Netherlands Civil Code.

Taxation The following is a summary of the material Dutch and US tax consequences of an investment in ordinary shares or ADSs. This summary does not discuss every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to a particular investor who is subject to special treatment under any applicable law, and is not intended to be applicable in all respects to all categories of investors. This summary also assumes that our business will be conducted in the manner outlined in this document. Changes in our organizational structure or the manner in which we conduct our business may invalidate this summary. The laws upon which this summary is based are subject to change, perhaps with retroactive effect. A change to these laws may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect changes in the laws. Prospective investors should consult their professional tax advisors regarding their particular personal tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our ordinary shares or ADSs. Certain Dutch tax consequences for holders of ordinary shares or ADSs This summary describes the principal tax consequences that will generally apply in the case of an investment in the ordinary shares or ADSs under Dutch tax laws in force and in effect as of the date hereof, and is subject to changes in Dutch law, including changes that could have retroactive effect. Not every potential tax consequence of such investment under the laws of the Netherlands will be addressed. Dutch taxation of resident shareholders The summary of certain Dutch taxes set out in this section Dutch Taxation of Resident Shareholders is only intended for the following investors: · Individuals who are resident or deemed to be resident or who have opted to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation and who invest in the ordinary shares or ADSs, excluding individuals who invest in the ordinary shares or ADSs that form part of a substantial interest (as described below) or deemed substantial interest in us and excluding individuals who are our employees or who are deemed to be our employees or employees of any entity related to us (the Dutch Individuals); and · Corporate entities (including associations which are taxable as corporate entities) that are resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation and who invest in the ordinary shares or ADSs, excluding: · Corporate entities that are not subject to Dutch corporate income tax; · Pension funds (pensioenfondsen) and other entities that are wholly or partly exempt from Dutch corporate income tax; 180 Information for shareholders and investors · Corporate entities that hold ordinary shares or ADSs that qualify for application of the participation exemption (as laid down in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969); and · Investment institutions (beleggingsinstellingen) and tax exempt investment institutions (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen) as defined in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969; (the Dutch Corporate Entities). Generally, a holder of ordinary shares or ADSs will not have a substantial interest if he, his spouse, certain other relatives (including foster children) or certain persons sharing his household, do not hold, alone or together, whether directly or indirectly, the ownership of, or certain other rights over, ordinary shares representing 5% or more of our total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares), or rights to acquire ordinary shares, whether or not already issued, that represent at any time 5% or more of our total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares) or the ownership of certain profit participating certificates that relate to 5% or more of our annual profit and/or to 5% or more of our liquidation proceeds. Individual and corporate income tax For Dutch Individuals not engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise and Dutch individuals for whom the benefits derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs are not treated as result from other activities, the following applies: The taxable benefit from a Dutch Individuals savings and investments (sparen en beleggen) is set annually at 4% of the average of the so-called yield basis (rendementsgrondslag) at the beginning and at the end of a year, insofar as the average exceeds the exempt net asset amount (heffingvrij vermogen). Such taxable benefit is reduced by such portion of the personal allowance as has not been taken into account in respect of certain other types of income. This benefit is taxed at the rate of 30%. For Dutch Individuals who invest in the ordinary shares or ADSs, the ordinary shares or ADSs will form part of the yield basis. The ordinary shares or ADSs will be taken into account in the yield basis at their fair market value. The actual benefits from the ordinary shares or ADSs do not influence the taxable benefit, even if they exceed, or are lower than, 4% of the yield basis. For Dutch Individuals engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise, Dutch Individuals for whom the benefits derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs are treated as result from other activities, and Dutch Corporate Entities, the following applies: Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs (including any capital gains realized on the disposal thereof) that are attributable to an enterprise carried on in the Netherlands by a Dutch Individual or to an enterprise effectively managed in the Netherlands in which he has an interest, are generally subject to income tax charged at progressive rates. The same applies to a Dutch Individual for whom the benefits derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs are treated as result from other activities. Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs (including any capital gains realized on the disposal thereof) that are held by a Dutch Corporate Entity are generally subject to corporate income tax. Withholding tax Dividends we distribute are generally subject to a withholding tax imposed by the Netherlands at a rate of 15%. The concept dividends we distribute used in this section includes, but is not limited to: · Distributions in cash or in kind, deemed and constructive distributions and repayments of paid-in capital not recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes; · Liquidation proceeds, proceeds of redemption of the ordinary shares or ADSs or, as a rule, consideration for the repurchase of the ordinary shares or ADSs by us in excess of the average paid-in capital recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes; · The par value of the ordinary shares or ADSs issued to a holder of the ordinary shares or ADSs or an increase of the par value of the ordinary shares or ADSs, as the case may be, to the extent that it does not appear that a contribution, recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, has been made or will be made; and · Partial repayment of paid-in capital, recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, if and to the extent that there are net profits (zuivere winst), unless: - The general meeting of our shareholders has resolved in advance to make such repayment; and - The par value of the ordinary shares or ADSs concerned has been reduced by an equal amount by way of an amendment of the articles of association. 181 Information for Shareholders and Investors · Dutch Individuals and Dutch Corporate Entities generally can credit the dividend withholding tax against their income tax or corporate income tax liability and will be entitled to a refund of dividend withholding tax insofar as such tax, together with any other creditable domestic and/or foreign taxes, exceeds their aggregate income tax or corporate income tax liability. A condition to avoid dividend stripping is that the recipient of proceeds from the ordinary shares or ADSs qualifies as the beneficial owner thereof. A recipient of proceeds from the ordinary shares or ADSs is not considered to be the beneficial owner thereof if the amount of dividend, following a set of transactions, is ultimately wholly or partly received by another person, if this other person also retains, directly or indirectly, an interest in the ordinary shares or ADSs and the recipient is entitled to a (partial) refund or exemption to which the other person is not entitled. Gift and inheritance taxes A gift tax liability will arise in the Netherlands with respect to an acquisition of the ordinary shares or ADSs by way of a gift made by a Dutch individual or a Dutch corporate entity. An inheritance tax liability will arise in the Netherlands with respect to an acquisition or deemed acquisition of the ordinary shares or ADSs on the death of a Dutch individual. For purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance taxes, an individual of Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his death. For purposes of the Dutch gift tax, an individual not holding Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the 12 months preceding the date of the gift. Taxation of US investors The following is a summary of the material US federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs to you if you are an eligible US holder (as defined below) but it does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to you or your situation, including tax considerations that arise from rules of general application to all taxpayers or to certain classes of investors or that are generally assumed to be known by you. In particular, the summary does not address considerations that may be applicable to you if you will not hold ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets, if you are not an eligible US holder, or if you are a taxpayer subject to special tax rules, such as a bank, tax-exempt entity, insurance company, a regulated investment company, a pension fund, a real estate investment trust, a dealer in securities or currencies, a person that holds ordinary shares or ADSs as part of an integrated investment (including a straddle) comprised of ordinary shares or ADSs and one or more other positions, a person that holds ordinary shares or ADSs as a position in a synthetic security, hedging transaction or conversion transaction, a person liable for the alternative minimum tax and a person who owns or is deemed to own 10% or more of any class of our stock. The summary is based on laws, treaties and regulatory interpretations in effect on the date of this document, all of which are subject to change. You should consult your own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the ordinary shares or ADSs in light of your particular circumstances, including the US tax considerations discussed below and the effect of any state, local or other national laws. You are an eligible US holder if you are a resident of the US for purposes of the tax treaty between the Netherlands and the US (the tax treaty) and are fully eligible for benefits under the tax treaty. You generally will be entitled to the benefits of the tax treaty if you are: · The beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs (and of the dividends paid with respect to such ordinary shares or ADSs); · A US person (i. e., an individual resident of the US, a US corporation, or a partnership, estate or trust to the extent your income is subject to taxation in the US as the income of a resident, in your hands or in the hands of your partners or beneficiaries); · Not resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes; and · Not subject to an anti-treaty shopping rule. You generally will not be eligible for the benefits of the tax treaty, and therefore will not be an eligible US holder, if you hold ordinary shares or ADSs in connection with the conduct of business through a permanent establishment, or the performance of 182 Information for shareholders and investors services through a fixed base in the Netherlands, or you are not resident in the US for US tax purposes. If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for US tax purposes) holds ordinary shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for US tax purposes) that holds ordinary shares or ADSs, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs. Based on our audited financial statements and relevant market data, we believe that we were not treated as a passive foreign investment company or PFIC for US federal income tax purposes with respect to the year 2008. In addition, based on our current expectations regarding the value and nature of our assets, the sources and nature of our income, and relevant market data, we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the year 2009 or thereafter. We believe, however, that we were or may have been a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes with respect to the years before 2005. See Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules, below. US holders that held our ordinary shares or ADSs at any time before 2005 should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules to their ordinary shares or ADSs. For US federal income tax purposes beneficial owners of ADSs will be treated as the owners of the underlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs. Taxation of dividends The gross amount of distributions paid by us (including amounts withheld in respect of Dutch withholding tax) generally will be subject to US federal income taxation as foreign source ordinary dividend income to the extent paid or deemed paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under US federal income tax principles), and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in our ordinary shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not maintain calculations of earnings and profits and you should therefore assume that any distribution we make with respect to our ordinary shares and ADSs will constitute ordinary dividend income. Subject to certain exceptions for positions that are hedged or held for less than 60 days, an individual US holder generally will be subject to US taxation at a maximum rate of 15% in respect of dividends received before January 1, 2011, unless we were in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and are, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a PFIC. As described above, we believe that we were not a PFIC for US tax purposes with respect to the year 2008, and also do not anticipate becoming a PFIC with respect to the year 2009. Dividends paid in Euro will be included in income in a US dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt by you (or by the depositary in the case of ADSs). If such dividends are converted into US dollar on the date of receipt, you generally should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. If you receive a refund of Dutch withholding tax under the tax treaty between the Netherlands and the US, you may be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss to the extent the amount of the tax treaty refund (in dollars) received by you differs from the US dollar equivalent of the refund amount on the date the dividends were received. You may claim the benefit of the reduced withholding rate of 15% that is available under the tax treaty between the Netherlands and the US by submitting a duly completed Form IB 92 (USA) (available at www.belastingdienst.nl) that has been certified by a financial institution (typically the entity that holds the ordinary shares or ADSs as custodian for the holder). If we receive the required documentation prior to the relevant dividend payment date, we may apply the reduced withholding rate at source. If you fail to satisfy these requirements prior to the payment of a dividend, you may claim a refund of the excess of the amount withheld over the tax treaty rate by filing Form IB 92 (USA) together with a supplemental statement with the Dutch tax authorities. Pension funds and tax-exempt organizations qualifying for a complete exemption from tax are not entitled to claim tax treaty benefits at source, and instead must file claims for refund by filing Form IB 95 (USA) (also available at www.belastingdienst.nl). 183 Information for Shareholders and Investors Subject to applicable limitations and to the special considerations discussed below, Dutch withholding tax at the 15% tax treaty rate will be treated as a foreign income tax that is eligible for credit against your US federal income tax liability or, at your election, may be deducted in computing taxable income. Foreign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged positions and may not be allowed in respect of arrangements in which your expected economic profit, after non-US taxes, is insubstantial. You should consult your own advisers concerning the implications of these rules in light of your particular circumstances. Taxation of capital gains Subject to the discussion below under Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules, gain or loss realized by you on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs will be capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between your basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs and the dollar-value of the amount realized on the disposition. (If the amount realized is denominated in a foreign currency, such amount shall be determined at the spot rate on the date of disposition, or, at the spot rate on the settlement date if the shares or ADSs are traded on an established securities market and you are a cash basis eligible US holder or an accrual basis eligible US holder that so elects). The gain or loss will be long-term gain or loss if the ordinary shares or ADSs were held for more than one year. Long-term capital gain recognized by an individual US holder before January 1, 2011 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15%. Passive foreign investment company rules Unfavourable US tax rules (the PFIC rules) apply to companies that are considered passive foreign investment companies (PFICs). We will be classified as a PFIC in a particular taxable year if either (a) 75% or more of our gross income is treated as passive income for purposes of the PFIC rules; or (b) the average percentage of the value of our assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50%. As explained above, we believe that we were not a PFIC for US tax purposes with respect to the year 2008, and also do not anticipate becoming a PFIC with respect to the year 2009 and thereafter. We believe, however, that we were or may have been a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes with respect to the years before 2005. If we were a PFIC in the past, US holders that held our ordinary shares or ADSs at any time during the years when we were a PFIC and did not make certain US tax elections (a mark-to-market election or a QEF election) will be subject to adverse tax treatment. For instance, such holders will be subject to a special tax at ordinary income tax rates on certain dividends that we pay and on gains realized on the sale of ordinary shares or ADSs (excess distributions) in all subsequent years, even though we ceased to qualify as a PFIC. The amount of this tax will be increased by an interest charge to compensate for tax deferral, calculated as if the excess distributions had been earned ratably over the period the US holder held its ordinary shares or ADSs. It may be possible, in certain circumstances, for a holder to avoid the application of the PFIC rules by making a deemed sale election for its taxable year that includes the last day of our last taxable year during which we qualified as a PFIC. The PFIC rules are extremely complex, and you should consult your own tax advisers regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules to your ordinary shares or ADSs and the desirability and availability of a deemed sale election. US backup withholding tax and information reporting Payments in respect of the ordinary shares or ADSs that are made in the US or by a US-related financial intermediary will be subject to information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding unless you: (a) are a corporation or other exempt recipient; or (b) provide an IRS Form W-9 or an acceptable substitute form, certifying your taxpayer identification number and that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred. If you are not a US citizen or a US person (as defined in the introduction to this discussion), you generally are not subject to these rules, but may be required to provide certification of non-US status in order to establish that you are exempt. Documents on display We are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in accordance therewith file information with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 184 Information for Shareholders and Investors You may read and copy this information at the following location: Public Reference Room 100 F Street, N.

Any filings we make electronically are available to the public over the internet at the Commissions website at www.sec.gov and at our website at www.crucell.com. Exchange Controls There are currently no Dutch laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the export or import of capital, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange controls, or that affect the remittance of dividends or other payments to non-Dutch residents or to US holders of our securities except as otherwise set forth in Taxation in this section. Significant changes Other than as disclosed in this Annual Report, no significant change has occurred since December 31, 2008, the date of our most recent audited financial statements. Limitation of liability and indemnification matters Pursuant to Dutch law, each member of our Supervisory and Management Boards is responsible to us for the proper performance of his or her assigned duties. They are also responsible for taking measures to prevent the consequences of any improper performance of duties by another member of our Supervisory Board or our Management Board. Our articles of association provide that our Management Board members and our Supervisory Board members are discharged from liability for their actions as board members if our General Meeting of Shareholders adopts a resolution to that effect. This discharge extends only to actions or omissions disclosed in or apparent from the adopted annual accounts or otherwise communicated to our General Meeting of Shareholders. This discharge of liability may be limited by mandatory provisions of Dutch law, such as in the case of bankruptcy. Under Dutch law, our Supervisory Board members and members of our Management Board generally cannot be held personally liable for decisions made exercising their reasonable business judgment. Our articles of association provide that we shall generally indemnify any person who is or was a member of our Supervisory Board or our Management Board or one of our employees, officers or agents, and who suffers any loss as a result of any action in connection with their service to us, provided they acted in good faith in carrying out their duties.
