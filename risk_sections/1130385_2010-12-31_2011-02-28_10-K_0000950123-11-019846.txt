Risk Factors Related to Our Financial Reporting and Corporate Governance If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected. Although we had no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2010, we have reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past. There can be no assurance that we will avoid a material weakness in the future. If we have another material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, it could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner. Our use of the percentage-of-completion accounting method could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits. A substantial portion of our revenues is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Revisions to estimated revenues and estimated costs can and do result in changes to revenues, costs and profits. For further information on our revenue recognition methodology, please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Revenue Recognition on Long-Term Contracts, to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. 19 Table of Contents Registered holders who acquired our shares after the Redomestication must apply for enrollment in our share register as shareholders with voting rights in order to have voting rights; we may deny such registration under certain circumstances. To be able to exercise voting rights, registered holders of our shares who acquired our shares after the Redomestication must apply to us for enrollment in our share register as shareholders with voting rights. Our board of directors may refuse to register holders of shares as shareholders with voting rights based on certain grounds. In particular, under our articles of association, no shareholder will be registered with voting rights for 10% or more of our share capital as recorded in the commercial register. Only shareholders that are registered as shareholders with voting rights on the relevant record date are permitted to participate in and vote at a general shareholders meeting. Registered holders who received our shares as a result of the Redomestication are registered as shareholders with voting rights and shareholders who hold in street name will be entitled to participate in and vote at a general shareholders meeting through Cede & Co. There are provisions in our articles of association that may reduce the voting rights of our registered shares. Our articles of association provide that shareholders have one vote for each registered share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders. However, our articles of association provide that shareholders whose controlled shares (as defined in the articles of association) represent 10% or more of our total voting shares are limited to voting one vote less than 10% of the total voting rights of our share capital as registered with the commercial register. This provision is intended to prevent the possibility of our company becoming a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could have certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. persons who own (directly, indirectly or under applicable constructive ownership rules) 10% or more of our voting shares. It may also have an anti-takeover effect by making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. Under our articles of association, our board of directors has the authority to interpret and grant exceptions to this provision. Our status as a Swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management. Swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without further shareholder approval. Such authorization is limited to 50 percent of the issued share capital and expires after two years at the latest and must therefore be renewed by the shareholders every two years. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including exceptions explicitly described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. In the event we need to raise share capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the CHF 3.00 (equivalent to U.S. $3.22, based on a foreign exchange rate of CHF 0.9319 to U.S. $1.00 on December 31, 2010) par value of the shares, we will need to obtain the approval of our shareholders to decrease the par value of our issued shares or issue another class of shares with a lower par value. Any reduction in par value would decrease our par value available for future repayment of share capital not subject to Swiss withholding tax. In addition, we will not be able to issue options under our various compensation and benefit plans with an exercise price below the par value, which could limit the flexibility of our compensation arrangements. Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. For example, dividends must be approved by shareholders. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. 20 Table of Contents If we elect to declare dividends, we would be required to declare such dividends in Swiss francs and any currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc will affect the dollar value of the dividends we pay. Under Swiss corporate law, if we elect to declare dividends, including distributions through a reduction in par value, we would be required to declare such dividends in Swiss francs. Dividend payments will be made by our transfer agent in U.S. dollars converted at the applicable exchange rate shortly before the payment date. As a result, shareholders will be exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the date used for purposes of calculating the CHF amount of any proposed dividend or par value reduction and the relevant payment date, which will not be shorter than two months and could be as long as a year. We may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax. If we are not successful in our efforts to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying additional paid-in capital, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, which we refer to as the U.S.-Swiss Treaty, may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in the case of qualified pension funds). Payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction is not subject to Swiss withholding tax. However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value; that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value; or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions will be limited. If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or pay a dividend out of qualifying additional paid-in capital, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes. We have anti-takeover provisions in our articles of association that may discourage a change of control. Our articles of association and Swiss law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions provide for:  Our board of directors to be divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms. In addition, directors may be removed from office, by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the issued shares generally entitled to vote. These provisions of our articles of association may delay or limit the ability of a shareholder to obtain majority representation on the board of directors.  Limiting the voting rights of shareholders whose controlled shares (as defined in the articles of association) represent 10% or more of our total voting shares to one vote less than 10% of the total voting rights of our share capital as registered with the Swiss commercial register.  Under Swiss corporate law, merger and demerger transactions require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 662/3% of the shares represented at the applicable shareholders meeting. In addition, under certain circumstances (for example, in the case of so-called cashout or squeezeout mergers) a merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90% of shares.  Any shareholder who wishes to propose any business or to nominate a person or persons for election as a director at any annual meeting may only do so if advance notice is given to our Corporate Secretary. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if the third-partys offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders. As a result, shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. 21 Table of Contents We are a Swiss company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers. Foster Wheeler AG is a Swiss corporation. As a result, the rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and by our articles of association and organizational regulations. The rights of shareholders under Swiss law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies of other jurisdictions. A substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. It may be difficult for investors to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or our directors based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. Uncertainty exists as to whether courts in Switzerland will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Switzerland under the securities laws of other jurisdictions.
