Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company and Our Industry We may be adversely affected by volatile solar power market and industry conditions; in particular, the demand for our solar power products may decline, which may reduce our revenues and earnings. We are influenced by conditions in the solar power market and industry. In 2010, demand for solar power products increased and many manufacturers increased their production capacity accordingly as the effects of the global financial crisis subsided. In 2011, a decrease in payments to solar power producers in the form of feed-in tariffs and other reimbursements, a reduction in available financing and an excess supply of solar PV modules worldwide put severe downward pressure on solar PV module prices in European and other markets. As a result, many solar power plant developers, solar system installers and solar PV products distributors that purchase solar power products, including solar PV modules from manufacturers like us, were adversely affected and their financial condition weakened. Although our shipments increased year-over-year in 2011 and 2012, average selling prices for our solar PV modules declined significantly. In 2012, oversupply conditions across the value chain, difficult economic conditions in Europe as well as escalating foreign trade disputes in the U.S., Europe, India and China affected industry-wide demand and put continued pressure on average selling prices, resulting in lower revenue for many industry participants. If the supply of solar PV modules grows faster than demand, and if governments continue to reduce financial support for the solar industry and impose trade barriers, demand for our products as well as our average selling price could be materially and adversely affected. 4 Table of Contents The demand for solar power products is influenced by macroeconomic factors, such as global economic conditions, demand for electricity, the supply and prices of other energy products, such as oil, coal and natural gas, as well as government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, the solar and other alternative energy industries and the environment. For example, a reduction in oil and coal prices may reduce the demand for alternative energy. Also, during 2011 and 2012, a decrease in solar power tariffs and a difficult financing environment caused a decrease in the demand for solar PV systems. Solar power prices decreased as governments, forced by the global economic crisis to implement austerity measures, reduced subsidies, such as feed-in tariffs. Further, many downstream purchasers of solar power products were unable to secure sufficient financing for their PV projects. As a result, many purchasers of solar power products were unable or unwilling to expand their operations. In light of the uncertainty in the global credit and lending environment, we cannot make assurances that financial institutions will continue to offer funding to solar PV project developers at reasonable costs. An increase in interest rates or a decrease in funding of capital projects within the global financial market could make it difficult to fund PV systems and potentially reduce the demand for PV modules and/or reduce the average selling prices for PV modules, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If the supply of solar wafers and cells increases in line with increases in the supply of polysilicon, then the corresponding oversupply of solar cells and modules may cause substantial downward pressure on the prices of our products and reduce our revenues and earnings. Silicon production capacity has expanded rapidly in recent years. As a result of this expansion, coupled with the global economic downturn, the solar industry experienced an oversupply of high-purity silicon in 2009, which contributed to an oversupply of solar wafers, cells and modules and resulted in substantial downward pressure on prices throughout the value chain in 2009. Strong demand in 2010 stabilized and strengthened prices across the value chain, particularly in the second half of 2010, and, according to Solarbuzz, an independent solar energy research and consulting firm, from the end of 2009 to the end of 2010, module pricing increased from approximately $1.65 to approximately $1.90 per watt, cell pricing increased from approximately $1.25 to approximately $1.40 per watt and wafer pricing increased from approximately $0.80 to approximately $1.00 per watt. Polysilicon prices also increased in 2010 compared to 2009, from approximately $50 to $55 per kilogram to approximately $80 to $90 per kilogram. In 2011, the solar industry again experienced oversupply across the value chain, and by the end of the year, module pricing was approximately $1.00 per watt, cell pricing was approximately $0.55 per watt and wafer pricing was approximately $0.41 per watt. According to Solarbuzz, demand for solar products remained soft in 2012 and at the end of 2012, module pricing was approximately $0.78 per watt, cell pricing was approximately $0.43 per watt, wafer pricing was approximately $0.25 per watt and polysilicon pricing was approximately $24.66 per kilogram. Our average module selling price has decreased from $1.80 per watt in 2010 to $1.34 per watt in 2011 and to $0.77 per watt in 2012, in large part because the increase in the supply of solar cells and modules was greater than the increase in the demand therefor. As a result of the decline in our module selling prices, our revenue declined in 2012, even though our module shipment volume for the year increased. In addition, because module prices declined at a rapid rate, we suffered losses in the form of inventory write-downs, as the market price of modules consistently fell below the carrying cost of our inventory. Lower price realizations and inventory write-downs in 2012 put downward pressure on our gross profit and operating margins. Continued increases in solar module production in excess of market demand may result in further downward pressure on the price of solar cells and modules, including our products. Increasing competition could also result in us losing sales or market share. If we are unable, on an ongoing basis, to procure silicon, solar wafers and solar cells at reasonable prices or mark up the price of our solar modules to cover our manufacturing and operating costs, our revenues and margins will continue to be adversely impacted, either due to higher costs compared to our competitors or due to further write- 5 Table of Contents downs of inventory, or both. In addition, our market share could decline if our competitors are able to price their products more competitively. The execution of our growth strategy depends upon the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements for our customers, which is affected by general economic conditions. Tight credit markets could depress demand or prices for solar products, hamper our expansion and materially affect our results of operations. General economic conditions, liquidity and the availability and cost of capital could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Most solar power projects, including our own, require financing for development and construction with a mixture of equity and third party funding. The cost of capital affects both the demand and price of solar power systems. A high cost of capital may materially reduce the internal rate of return for solar power projects and therefore put downward pressure on the prices of both solar systems and solar modules, which typically comprise approximately 40% to 50% of the cost of solar power projects. Furthermore, solar power projects compete for capital with other forms of investment such as bonds. Some classes of investors compare the returns of solar power projects with bond yields and expect a similar or higher internal rate of return, adjusted for risk and liquidity. Higher interest rates could render existing funding more expensive and present an obstacle for potential funding that would otherwise spur the growth of the solar power industry. In addition, higher bond yields could result in increased yield expectations for solar power projects, which would result in lower system prices. In the event that suitable funding is unavailable, our customers may be unable to pay for products they have agreed to purchase. It may also be difficult to collect payments from customers facing liquidity challenges due to either customer defaults or financial institution defaults on project loans. Constricted credit markets may impede our expansion and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Concerns about government deficits and debt in the European Union, or EU, our major market, have increased bond spreads in certain solar markets, such as Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. The cash flow of a solar power project is often derived from government-funded or government-backed feed-in tariffs. Consequently, the availability and cost of funding solar power projects is determined in part based on the perceived sovereign credit risk of the country where a particular project is located. Therefore, credit agency downgrades of nations in the EU could decrease the credit available for solar power projects, increase the expected rate of return compared to bond yields, and increase the cost of debt for solar power projects in countries with a higher perceived sovereign credit risk. Governments may revise, reduce or eliminate subsidies and economic incentives for solar power, which could cause demand for our products to decline. The market for on-grid applications, where solar power supplements the electricity a customer purchases from the utility network or sells to a utility under a feed-in tariff, depends largely on the availability and size of government subsidy programs and economic incentives. At present, the cost of solar power exceeds retail electricity rates in many locations. Government incentives vary by geographic market. Government bodies in many countries, most notably Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, the United States, Japan, Canada (Ontario), South Korea, Greece, France, Australia and Spain, have provided incentives in the form of feed-in tariffs, rebates, tax credits, renewable portfolio standards and other incentives. These governments have implemented mandates to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar power products to promote the use of solar energy in on-grid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. Some of these government mandates and economic incentives, such as the German Renewable Energy Law, are scheduled to be reduced and could be altered or eliminated altogether through new legislation. For example, in January, July and October of 2010, Germany introduced reductions in solar feed-in tariffs of approximately 24-26% for rooftop systems and 20-25% for ground-based systems. Germany further reduced its feed-in tariffs in 6 Table of Contents the beginning of 2012 by 15% to up to 24.43 Euro cents per kilowatt hour for rooftop systems and up to 18.76 Euro cents per kilowatt hour for ground-based systems. In June of 2012 the German government approved further changes to the Renewable Energy Law. Under the new rules solar systems smaller than 10 kW will receive subsidies of 19.5 Euro cents per kWh, solar systems between 10kW and 40 kW will receive subsidies of 18.5 Euro cents per kWh, systems over 40 kW to 1 MW will receive subsidies of 16.5 Euro cents per kWh and systems between 1MW and 10 MW will receive subsidies of 13.5 Euro cents per kWh. Systems larger than 10MW will no longer receive subsidies. In addition, for systems that still qualify for subsidies, the tariff will be adjusted downward on a monthly basis to limit growth in solar systems installations to a range of 2.5-3.0 GW per year. Under the new plan, photovoltaic subsidies will be stopped when a cumulative capacity of 52 GW is reached; cumulative capacity in the first quarter of 2013 was approximately 32 GW. In Italy, another important market for solar products in the past several years, total cumulative capacity reached 15.9 GW in October of 2012 and just €241 million is left in the country's solar subsidy program. Once this amount is used up and the funding limit of €6.7 billion is reached, Italy will no longer pay out subsidies on photovoltaic solar systems. Many other countries in Europe have reduced or eliminated their subsidies in the past few years and it is likely that this trend will continue, possibly until subsidies are phased out completely for solar energy. While solar power projects may continue to offer attractive internal rates of return, it is unlikely internal rates of return will be as high as they were in the past. If internal rates of return fall below an acceptable rate for project investors, and governments continue to reduce or eliminate subsidies, this may cause a decrease in demand and considerable downward pressure on solar system and therefore solar module prices. The reduction, modification or elimination of government mandates and economic incentives in one or more of our markets could therefore materially and adversely affect the growth of such markets or result in increased price competition, either of which could cause our revenues to decline and harm our financial results. We have, from time to time, entered into long-term supply agreements with polysilicon and wafer suppliers. Long-term supply agreements may make it difficult for us to adjust our raw material costs should prices decrease. Also, if we chose to prematurely terminate any of these agreements, we may not be able to recover all or any part of the advance payments we have made to these suppliers and we may be subject to litigation. In 2007 and 2008, due to shortages of polysilicon and silicon wafers, we entered into a number of long-term supply agreements with several silicon and wafer suppliers in an effort to secure raw materials to meet our production requirements. These suppliers included GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Limited, or GCL, Neo Solar Power Corp., or Neo Solar, Deutsche Solar AG, or Deutsche Solar, Jiangxi LDK Solar Hi-Tech Co., Ltd., or LDK, and a UMG-Si supplier. In response to the decline in the price of polysilicon, beginning in 2009, we began discussing adjustments in the unit price and volume terms under our supply agreements with these suppliers. In 2009 and thereafter, we agreed to amend our agreements with certain of them, including GCL, Neo Solar, LDK and the UMG-Si supplier, to adjust the purchase price to prevailing market prices at the time we place a purchase order and to reduce the quantity of products that we are required to purchase. Under our supply agreements with certain silicon wafer suppliers, and consistent with historical industry practice, we made advance payments prior to scheduled delivery dates. The advance payments were made without collateral and were to be credited against the purchase prices payable by us. As of December 31, 2012, the balance of advance payments that we have made to GCL, Deutsche Solar, LDK and the UMG-Si supplier totaled $45.4 million. We purchased the contracted volume for 2009 under our 12-year supply agreement with Deutsche Solar, but we did not purchase the contracted volumes for 2010 and 2011. The agreement contains a provision stating that, if we do not order the contracted volume in a given year, Deutsche Solar can 7 Table of Contents invoice us for the difference at the full contract price. We believe that it is more likely than not that the take-or-pay provisions of the agreement are void under German law. In December 2011, Deutsche Solar gave notice to us to terminate the 12-year wafer supply agreement with immediate effect. Deutsche Solar stated that the reason for the termination was an alleged breach of the agreement by us. In the notice, Deutsche Solar reserved its right to claim damages of €148.6 million ($196.0 million) in court. As a result of the termination, we reclassified the accrued loss on firm purchase commitments reserve of $27.9 million as of December 31, 2011 to loss contingency accruals. In addition, we made a full bad debt allowance of $17.4 million against the balance of advance payments to Deutsche Solar. The accrued amount of $27.9 million represents our best estimate for our loss contingency. Deutsche Solar did not specify the basis for its claimed damages of €148.6 million ($196.0 million) on the notice. In 2007, we entered into a three-year agreement with LDK under which we purchased specified quantities of silicon wafers and LDK converted our reclaimed silicon feedstock into wafers under a toll manufacturing arrangement. In 2008, we entered into two ten-year wafer supply agreements with LDK, under which we agreed to purchase specified volumes of wafers at pre-determined prices each year, commencing January 1, 2009. In April 2010, we gave LDK termination notice regarding our two ten-year supply agreements with them. We also initiated arbitration proceedings against LDK seeking a refund of certain advance payments that we made to them. In December of 2012, the Shanghai Branch of China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, or CIETAC Shanghai Branch, awarded RMB248.9 million ($40.0 million) plus RMB2.2 million ($0.4 million) in arbitration expenses in favor of LDK. The total amount of the award includes an RMB60.0 million ($9.6 million) initial deposit. See "Item 8. Financial InformationA. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial InformationLegal and Administrative Proceedings." We recorded a full bad debt allowance against this initial deposit in 2009. We made a loss provision totaling RMB188.9 million ($30.3 million) in 2012 following the arbitration award in favor of LDK. We dispute the merits of the arbitration award and will pursue all legal means to overturn or resist the implementation of the award. If we do not succeed, payment of the award to LDK could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Due to the default of the UMG-Si supplier in delivering its contracted volumes for 2010 and concerns regarding its financial position, we concluded that we were not likely to purchase any significant quantity of UMG-Si from this supplier in the future and made a full bad debt allowance against the advance payments of RMB64 million ($10.3 million) to the UMG-Si supplier in 2010. If our suppliers file lawsuits against us for early termination of these contracts, such events could be costly, may divert management's attention and other resources away from our business, and could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. While we currently do not have any such agreements, in the future, we may enter into new medium or long-term supply agreements for silicon wafers or solar cells with fixed price and quantity terms. If, during the term of these agreements, the price of materials decreases significantly and we are unable to renegotiate favorable terms with our suppliers, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, and our earnings could decline. In addition, if demand for our PV products decreases, yet our supply agreements require us to purchase more polysilicon than required to meet customer demand, we may incur costs associated with carrying excess inventory. To the extent that we are not able to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 8 Table of Contents Existing regulations and policies, and changes to these regulations and policies, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services. The market for electricity generation products in the countries where we sell our products is heavily influenced by federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies disseminated by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation, and could deter further investment in the research and development of alternative energy sources as well as customer purchases of solar power technology, which could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our solar power products. We expect that our solar power products and installation will continue to be subject to federal, state and local regulations and policies relating to safety, utility interconnection and metering, construction, environmental protection, and other related matters. Any new regulations or policies pertaining to our solar power products may result in significant additional expenses to us, our resellers and customers, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar power products. Our significant international operations expose us to a number of risks, including unfavorable political, regulatory, labor and tax conditions in the countries where we operate. We intend to continue to extend our global reach and capture market share through the establishment of manufacturing sites and logistic centers in key global markets. Throughout the process of establishing operating facilities in these markets, we could be exposed to risks, including political, regulatory, labor and tax risks. Furthermore, we may need to make substantial investments in these overseas operations, both initially and on an ongoing basis, in order to attain longer-term sustainable returns. These investments could influence our financial performance before sustainable profitability is recognized. Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do, we may not be able to compete successfully and we may not be able to maintain or increase our market share. We have a large number of competitors, including non-China-based competitors such as First Solar, Inc., or First Solar, and Sharp Solar Corporation, or Sharp Solar, and China-based competitors such as Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited, or Yingli, Trina Solar Limited, or Trina, and Suntech Power Holdings Co. Ltd., or Suntech. Some of our competitors are developing or are currently producing products based on new solar power technologies that may ultimately have costs similar to or lower than our projected costs. These include products based on thin film PV technology, which requires either no silicon or significantly less silicon to produce than crystalline silicon solar modules, such as the ones that we produce, and is less susceptible to increases in silicon costs. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name and brand recognition, access to larger customer bases, greater resources and significantly greater economies of scale than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have stronger relationships or may enter into exclusive relationships with some of the key distributors or system integrators to whom we sell our products. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer demands or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sales of their products. Some of our competitors have more diversified product offerings, which may better position them to withstand a decline in demand for solar power products. Some of our competitors are more vertically integrated than we are, from upstream silicon wafer manufacturing to solar power system integration. This may allow them to capture higher margins or have lower costs. In addition, new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. If we fail to compete successfully, our business will suffer and we may not be able to maintain or increase our market share. 9 Table of Contents If sufficient demand for solar power products does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our revenues may not increase or may continue to decline, and we may be unable to sustain our profitability. The solar power market is still at a relatively early stage of development and future demand for solar power products is uncertain. Market data for the solar power industry is not as readily available as for more established industries, where trends are more reliably assessed from data gathered over a longer period. In addition, demand for solar power products in our targeted markets, including Germany, the U.S., Japan, China, Canada, Spain, Korea, the United Kingdom, Italy, India and France may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate. Many factors may affect the viability of solar power technology and the demand for solar power products, including: the cost-effectiveness, performance and reliability of solar power products, including our utility-scale solar power plants, compared to conventional and other renewable energy sources and products; the availability of government subsidies and incentives to support the development of the solar power industry; the cost and availability of capital, including long-term debt and tax equity, for solar projects; the success of other alternative energy technologies, such as wind power, hydroelectric power, geothermal power and biomass fuel; fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and other renewable energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil, gas and other fossil fuels; capital expenditures by end users of solar power products, which tend to decrease when the economy slows; and the lack of favorable regulation for solar power within the electric power industry and broader energy industry. If solar power technology is not suitable for widespread adoption or if sufficient demand for solar power products does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our revenues may suffer and we may be unable to sustain our profitability. We face risks associated with the marketing, distribution and sale of our solar power products internationally and, if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, they could impair our ability to expand our business abroad. The international marketing, distribution and sale of our products expose us to a number of risks, including: difficulties staffing and managing overseas operations; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the increased cost of understanding local markets and trends and developing and maintaining an effective marketing and distribution presence in various countries; the difficulty of providing customer service and support in various countries; the difficulty of managing our sales channels effectively as we expand beyond distributors to include direct sales to systems integrators, end users and installers; the difficulty of managing the development, construction and sale of our utility-scale solar power projects on a timely and profitable basis as a result of technical difficulties, commercial disputes with our customers, changes in regulations among other factors; 10 Table of Contents the difficulties and costs of complying with the different commercial, legal and regulatory requirements in the overseas markets in which we offer our products; our failure to develop appropriate risk management and internal control structures tailored to overseas operations; our inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights; unanticipated changes in prevailing economic conditions and regulatory requirements; and trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our ability to expand our business abroad could suffer. Furthermore, some of these risks, such as currency fluctuations, could influence our financial performance. Imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing orders in one or more markets may result in additional costs to our customers, which could materially or adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial conditions and future prospects. In October 2011, a trade action was filed with the U.S. Department of Commerce, or USDOC, and the U.S. International Trade Commission, or USITC, by the U.S. unit of SolarWorld AG and six other U.S. firms, accusing Chinese producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, or CSPV cells, whether or not incorporated into modules, of selling their products (i.e., CSPV cells or modules incorporating these cells) into the United States at less than fair value, or dumping, and of receiving countervailable subsidies from the Chinese authorities. These firms asked the U.S. government to impose anti-dumping and countervailing duties on CSPV cells imported from China. The USDOC and the USITC investigated the validity of these claims. We were identified as one of a number of Chinese exporting producers of the subject goods to the U.S. market. We also have affiliate U.S. operations that import the subject goods from China. On October 9, 2012, the USDOC issued final affirmative determinations in the anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations. On November 7, 2012, the USITC ruled that imports of CSPV cells had caused material injury to the U.S. CSPV industry. As a result of these rulings, the Company is required to pay cash deposits on CSPV cells imported into the U.S. from China, whether alone or incorporated into modules. The announced cash deposit rates applicable to the Company were 13.94% (anti-dumping duty) and 15.24% (countervailing duty). The actual rates at which duties will be assessed and payable may be subject to administrative review next year and may differ from the announced deposit rates. These duties could materially and adversely affect our affiliated U.S. import operations and increase our cost of selling into the United States, thus adversely affecting our export sales to the United States, which is one of our growing markets. A number of parties have filed notice of their intent to challenge the rulings of the USDOC and USITC in appeals to the U.S. Court of International Trade. Decisions on those appeals are not expected until next year. On September 6, 2012, following a complaint lodged by SolarWorld AG and certain supporters, the European Commission initiated an anti-dumping investigation concerning imports into the EU of CSPV modules and key components (i.e., cells and wafers) originating in China. On November 8, 2012, following a complaint lodged by the same parties, the European Commission initiated an anti-subsidy investigation on these products. In each investigation, we were identified as one of a number of Chinese exporting producers of these products to the EU market. We also have affiliate EU operations that import these products from China. The Company was not chosen as one of the "sampled" companies in these EU investigations, which were required to provide written information to the EU authorities. 11 Table of Contents The Company requested "market economy treatment" in the anti-dumping investigation, but this request was denied. A number of other affected Chinese companies have filed an action for annulment of the decision that denied "market economy treatment". On March 5, 2013, the European Commission published a Regulation making all imports of CSPV modules and key components originating in or consigned from China subject to registration by EU Member State customs authorities. This registration requirement is likely to remain in effect through the pendency of the investigations. The Company filed comments contesting this registration decision and requested a hearing to express its views. Under the current timeline, we expect that provisional anti-dumping duties, if any, will be announced by June 6, 2013, provisional countervailing duties, if any, will be announced by August 8, 2013 and definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties, if any, will be announced by December 5 and 7, 2013, respectively. The EU is the largest market for solar products. Anti-dumping and/or countervailing (i.e., anti-subsidy) duties imposed on imports of our products into the EU could materially and adversely affect our affiliated EU import operations, increase our cost of selling into the EU, and adversely affect our EU export sales. In late November 2012, India initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imported solar products from China, Taiwan, the United States and Malaysia. The scope of the Indian complaint includes thin-film and CSPV cells and modules, as well as "glass and other suitable substrates". The period of investigation is from January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012. We completed and submitted a "sampling questionnaire" and were chosen by the Indian authorities to be a sampled company. We are now compiling the data requested of us. As with the U.S. and EU cases, duties on our sales to India could materially and adversely affect the Company, increasing our selling costs and reducing our export sales to India, which we view as a promising market. It is possible that an anti-subsidy investigation on solar products may also be initiated in India. Imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing orders in one or more markets may result in additional costs to our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial conditions and future prospects. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate from period to period. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate from period to period based on a number of factors, including: the average selling prices of our solar modules, solar system kits and products; the rate and cost at which we are able to expand our internal manufacturing capacity; the availability and price of solar cells and wafers from our suppliers and toll manufacturers; the availability and price of raw materials, particularly high-purity silicon; changes in government incentive programs and regulations, particularly in our key and target markets; the unpredictable volume and timing of customer orders; the loss of one or more key customers or the significant reduction or postponement of orders; availability of financing for on-grid and off-grid solar power applications; acquisition and investment costs; 12 Table of Contents the timing of completion of construction of our utility-scale solar power projects; the timing of successful customer acceptance testing of our utility-scale solar power projects; geopolitical turmoil and natural disasters within any of the countries in which we operate or sell products; foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in the U.S. dollar, Euro, RMB and Canadian dollar; our ability to establish and expand customer relationships; changes in our manufacturing costs; the timing of new products or technology introduced or announced by our competitors; increases or decreases in electricity rates due to changes in fossil fuel prices or other factors; allowances for doubtful accounts and advances to suppliers; inventory write-downs; long-lived asset impairment; depreciation charges relating to underutilized assets; loss on firm purchase commitments under long-term supply agreements; and construction progress of solar power projects and related revenue recognition. We base our planned operating expenses in part on our expectations of future revenues. A significant portion of our expenses will be fixed in the short-term. If our revenues for a particular quarter are lower than we expect, we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses proportionately, which would harm our operating results for the quarter. This may cause us to miss analysts' estimates or any guidance announced by us. If we fail to meet or exceed analysts' estimates, investor expectations or our own future guidance, even by a small amount, our share price could decline, perhaps substantially. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. The majority of our sales are denominated in Euros and U.S. dollars, with the remainder in other currencies such as the Renminbi, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and British pound. Our Renminbi costs and expenses are primarily related to domestic sourcing of solar cells, silicon wafers and silicon, other raw materials, toll manufacturing fees, labor costs and local overhead expenses. From time to time, we enter into loan arrangements with Chinese commercial banks that are denominated primarily in Renminbi or U.S. dollars. The greater part of our cash and cash equivalents are denominated in Renminbi. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly among the U.S. dollar, Euro, Renminbi and Canadian dollar, may affect our net profit margins and may result in fluctuations in foreign exchange and operating gains or losses. We recorded foreign exchange losses of $36.3 million, $40.0 million and $10.7 million in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, Euro and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions and China's foreign exchange policies. In late 2005, China amended its policy of tracking the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. The new policy permitted the Renminbi to fluctuate against a basket of foreign currencies, which caused the Renminbi to appreciate by approximately 21.5% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. However, since 2008, the Renminbi has fluctuated against other freely traded currencies. In June 2010, the PRC government announced that it would allow greater flexibility for the Renminbi to fluctuate against the U.S. dollar, which resulted in further appreciation of the Renminbi. 13 Table of Contents Between June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2012, the value of the Renminbi appreciated approximately 8.13% against the U.S. dollar. We cannot provide any assurances that the policy of the PRC government will not affect or the manner in which it may affect the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. Since 2008, we have hedged part of our foreign currency exposures against the U.S. dollar using foreign currency forward or option contracts in order to limit our foreign exchange losses. The collateral requirements to enter into hedging contracts and the expenses associated with purchasing currency options have increased. There are also notional limits on the size of the hedging transactions that we may enter into with any particular counterparty at any given time. However, the effectiveness of our hedging program may be limited with respect to cost effectiveness, cash management, exchange rate visibility and downside protection. We recorded a gain on change in foreign currency derivatives of $1.7 million in 2010, a loss on change in foreign currency derivatives of $5.8 million in 2011, and a loss on change in foreign currency derivatives of $4.4 million in 2012. The gains or losses on change in foreign currency derivatives are related to our hedging program. Volatility in foreign exchange rates will hamper, to some extent, our ability to plan our pricing strategy. To the extent that we are unable to pass along increased costs resulting from exchange rate fluctuations to our customers, our profits may materially decrease. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Seasonal variations in demand linked to construction cycles and weather conditions may influence our results of operations. Our business is subject to seasonal variations in demand linked to construction cycles and weather conditions. Purchases of solar power products tend to decrease during the winter months in our key markets, such as Germany, due to adverse weather conditions that can complicate the installation of solar power systems. Demand from other countries, such as Canada, the U.S., China and South Korea, may also be subject to significant seasonality. Seasonal variations could adversely affect our results of operations and make them more volatile and unpredictable. Our future success depends partly on our ability to significantly expand our capacity to manufacture solar components, which exposes us to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our future success depends on our ability to significantly increase our capacity to manufacture solar components. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to expand our business, maintain our competitive position, improve our profitability, and generate the cash flows we have currently forecasted. Our ability to establish additional manufacturing capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including: the need to raise significant additional funds to purchase raw materials and to build additional manufacturing facilities, which we may be unable to obtain on commercially reasonable terms or at all; delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including delays in equipment delivery by vendors; delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities; diversion of significant management attention and other resources; and failure to execute our expansion plan effectively. If we are unable to establish or successfully operate our internal solar components manufacturing capabilities, we may be unable to expand our business as planned. Moreover, even if we do expand our 14 Table of Contents manufacturing capacity, we might not be able to generate sufficient customer demand for our solar power products to support our increased production levels. Our future success depends partly on our ability to expand our utility-scale solar power project pipelines in several key markets, which exposes us to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our future success depends on our ability to expand our utility-scale solar power project pipelines. Our ability to expand our utility-scale solar project pipelines is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including: the need to raise significant additional funds to develop from scratch or purchase late-stage solar power projects, which we may be unable to obtain on commercially reasonable terms or at all; delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including delays in regulatory approvals, construction, grid-connection and customer acceptance testing; delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities; diversion of significant management attention and other resources; and failure to execute our project pipeline expansion plan effectively. If we are unable to successfully expand our utility-scale solar power project pipelines, we may be unable to expand our business, maintain our competitive position, improve our profitability, and generate the cash flows we have currently forecasted. Due to a variety of factors, including the general economic environment and conditions in financial markets, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or have access to external financing necessary to fund planned operations and make adequate capital investments. In the future we anticipate that our operating and capital expenditures requirements will increase substantially. To develop new products, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technology. We also anticipate that our operating costs will increase as we expand our manufacturing operations, hire additional personnel, make advance payments or pay more for our raw materials, including polysilicon, increase our sales and marketing efforts, invest in joint ventures and acquisitions, and continue our research and development efforts with respect to our products and manufacturing technologies. Certain of our suppliers require performance bonds issued by a bonding agency or letters of credit issued by financial institutions. Obtaining letters of credit requires adequate collateral. Our letter of credit facility is collateralized by restricted cash, which reduces the amount of cash available for operations. We incurred moderate capital expenditures in 2012 related to improvements of our solar cell manufacturing capacity, technology and other projects. Going forward, and once market conditions for our solar products improve, we expect that we have to make additional capital expenditures to enhance our solar cell and module manufacturing capacity. Our capital expenditures and use of working capital may be greater than we expect if we invest in additional development and construction of solar power plants or decide to accelerate the increase of our manufacturing capacity, both internally and through investments in selected joint ventures. The financing that we require for the construction of solar power plants may not be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, we could make additional investments in joint ventures or guarantee certain financial obligations of our joint ventures, which could reduce our cash flows, increase our indebtedness and expose us to the credit risk of our joint ventures. If our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to market additional equity or debt securities and/or obtain other debt financing. The economic 15 Table of Contents environment and conditions in financial markets may limit our ability to raise equity or debt capital on acceptable terms. Lenders may be unwilling to lend funds that would be required to supplement cash flows to support daily operations. Further, increased debt would result in increased expenses and may give rise to restrictive covenants or collateral requirements. Financing arrangements, including project financing for our solar power plants, may not be available to us, or may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. We may also seek to sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or refinance or restructure our debt. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, find other sources of capital to fund our operations and solar power plant projects, make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency required by our projects. If adequate funds and alternative resources are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, develop and construct solar power plants, develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network, maintain our research and development efforts, provide collateral for our projects or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly impaired. Our inability to do the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may be unable to obtain adequate financing due to market conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, which may adversely influence our ability to grow our business. Our operations are capital intensive. We rely on working capital financing from PRC commercial banks for our daily operations. Although we are currently able to obtain new working capital financing from PRC commercial banks, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Also, even though we are a publicly-traded company, we may not be able to raise capital via public equity and debt issuances due to market conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to obtain external financing is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including: our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; general market conditions for financing activities by manufacturers of photovoltaic and related products; and economic, political and other conditions in the PRC and elsewhere. If we are unable to obtain funding in a timely manner and on commercially acceptable terms, our growth prospects and future profitability may be adversely affected. The construction by us of large utility-scale solar power projects may require us to obtain project financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such project financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain project financing, or if it is only available on terms which are not acceptable to us, we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan. In addition, we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax-oriented, strategic industry and other investors. Such investors may not be available or may only have limited resources, in which case our ability to sell our projects may be prevented or delayed and our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected. Our dependence on Chinese banks to extend our existing loans and provide additional loans exposes us to funding risks, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. We require significant cash flow and funding to support our operations. For example, there is a significant time lag between the time that we make payments to our suppliers and the time that we collect payments from our customers. As a result, we rely on short-term borrowings to provide working capital for our daily operations. Since the majority of our short-term borrowings come from Chinese 16 Table of Contents banks, we are exposed to lending policy changes by the Chinese banks. In 2012, we successfully extended our short-term borrowings and, as of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding short-term borrowings of $849.8 million with Chinese banks. Between January 1, 2013 and March 31, 2013, we obtained new borrowings of approximately $240.1 million from Chinese banks, including $94.9 million with due dates beyond December 31, 2013. Also, between January 1, 2013 and March 31, 2013, we renewed existing bank facilities of approximately $64 million from Chinese banks with due dates beyond December 31, 2013. If the Chinese government changes its macroeconomic policies and forces Chinese banks to tighten their lending practices, or if Chinese banks are no longer willing to provide financing to solar power companies, including us, we may not be able to extend our short-term borrowings or make additional borrowings in the future. As a result, we may not be able to fund our operations to the same extent as in previous years, which may have a material and adverse effect on our operations. Our project development and construction activities may not be successful; projects under development may not receive required permits, property rights, power purchase agreements, interconnection and transmission arrangements; or financing or construction of projects may not commence or continue as scheduled, all of which could increase our costs, delay or cancel a project, and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. The development and construction of solar power plants involve known and unknown risks. We may be required to invest significant amounts of money for land and interconnection rights, preliminary engineering, permitting, legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible. Success in developing a particular project is contingent upon, among other things: securing land rights and related permits, including satisfactory environmental assessments; receipt of required land use and construction permits and approvals; receipt of rights to interconnect to the electric grid; payment of interconnection and other deposits (some of which are non-refundable); negotiation of satisfactory EPC agreements; and obtaining construction financing, including debt, equity and tax credits. In addition, successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including: delays in obtaining and maintaining required governmental permits and approvals; potential challenges from local residents, environmental organizations, and others who may not support the project; unforeseen engineering problems; subsurface land conditions; construction delays; cost over-runs; labor, equipment and materials supply shortages or disruptions (including labor strikes); additional complexities when conducting project development or construction activities in foreign jurisdictions, including operating in accordance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and applicable local laws and customs; and force majeure events, including adverse weather conditions and other events out of our control. If we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project or we fail to meet any agreed upon system-level capacity or energy output guarantees or warranties (including 25 year power output performance guarantees) or other contract terms, or our projects cause grid interference or other damage, the EPC or other agreements related to the project may be terminated and/or we may be subject to significant damages, penalties and other obligations relating to the project, including 17 Table of Contents obligations to repair, replace or supplement materials for the project. In 2013 and beyond, we still expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties, which may limit the availability of capital to use for other purposes, such as contract damages or repurchase payments. We may enter into fixed-price EPC agreements in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their solar power systems. All essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the EPC agreement for a particular project, and these costs are reflected in the overall fixed price that we charge our customers for the project. These cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us and the subcontractors, suppliers and other parties involved in the project. In addition, we require qualified, licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems. Shortages of skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs. Should miscalculations in planning a project occur, including those due to unexpected increases in commodity prices or labor costs, or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase the EPC sales price commensurately, we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period. Lack of transmission capacity availability, potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid, and other system constraints could significantly impact our ability to build PV plants and generate solar electricity power sales. In order to deliver electricity, our solar power plants need to connect to the transmission grid. The lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size, delays in project implementation, increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeiture of deposits that we may have made with respect to a given project. These transmission issues, as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear, could significantly impact our ability to build PV solar power plants, connect them to the grid, successfully complete customer acceptance testing, and receive payment for such solar power plants. Developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to commencing construction, which could adversely affect our business and results from our operations. Our solar power plant development cycles can take many months or years to mature. As a result, we may need to make significant upfront payments for, among other things, land rights and permitting in advance of commencing construction, and the receipt of any revenue, much of which is not recognized for several additional months following contract signing. Our inability to enter into sales contracts with customers after making such upfront payments could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these system investments through our long project development cycles. Our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens or we are not able to successfully complete the customer acceptance testing due to technical difficulties, equipment failure, or adverse weather, and we are unable to sell our solar projects at prices and on terms and timing that are acceptable to us. Cancellations of customer orders may make us unable to recoup any prepayments made to suppliers. In the past, we were generally required to make prepayments to certain suppliers of silicon wafers and cells and silicon raw materials. Although we require certain customers to make partial prepayments, there is a lag between the due date for the prepayment of purchased silicon wafers and cells and silicon raw materials and the time that our customers make prepayments. The purchase of solar wafers and cells and silicon raw materials through toll manufacturing arrangements has required, 18 Table of Contents and will continue to require us to make significant commitments of working capital beyond the cash flows generated from our operations to support our estimated production output. In the event our customers cancel their orders, we may not be able to recoup prepayments made to suppliers, which could adversely influence our financial condition and results of operations. Credit terms offered to some of our customers expose us to the credit risks of such customers and may increase our costs and expenses, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our revenues, liquidity and results of operations. We offer some customers unsecured short-term or medium-term credit based on our relationships with them and market conditions. As a result, our claims for payments and sales credits rank as unsecured claims, which would expose us to credit risk if our customers become insolvent or bankrupt. From time to time, we sell our products to high credit risk customers in order to gain early access to emerging or promising markets, increase our market share in existing key markets or because of the prospects of future sales with a rapidly growing customer. There are high credit risks in doing business with these customers because they are often small, young and high-growth companies with significant unfunded working capital, inadequate balance sheets and credit metrics and limited operating histories. If these customers are not able to obtain satisfactory working capital, maintain adequate cash flow, or obtain construction financing for the projects where our modules are used, they may be unable to pay for the products for which they have submitted purchase orders or of which they have taken delivery. Our legal recourse under such circumstances may be limited if the customer's financial resources are already constrained or if we wish to continue to do business with that customer. For example, we took back solar modules that we had sold and shipped to certain customers that were unable to pay under the terms of our agreements or to provide any security that would have allowed us to extend our payment terms. As a result, we resold the modules to other customers at lower prices, which negatively influenced our revenue and margins. Revenue recognition for this type of customer is deferred until cash is received. If more customers to whom we extend credit are unable to pay for our products, our revenues, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our dependence on a limited number of silicon wafer and cell and silicon suppliers, and the limited number of suppliers for certain other components, such as silver metallization paste, solar module back-sheet, and ethylene vinyl acetate encapsulant, could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers in the required quantities or in a timely manner, which could result in order cancellations and decreased revenues. We purchase silicon raw materials, which include solar grade silicon, silicon wafers and solar cells, from a limited number of third-party suppliers. Our largest supplier of raw materials by dollar amount of purchases accounted for approximately 10.3%, 20.5% and 18.1% of our total raw materials purchases in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Our major suppliers of silicon wafers include GCL, ReneSola Ltd., or ReneSola, and Konca Solar Cell., Ltd, or Konca. Our major suppliers of solar cells include Topcell Solar International Co., Ltd, or Topcell, Shunfeng Photovoltaic International Limited, or Shunfeng, and Neo Solar. These suppliers may not always be able to meet our quantity requirements, or to keep pace with the price reductions or quality improvements, necessary for us to price our products competitively. Supply may also be interrupted by accidents, disasters or other unforeseen events over which we have no control. For example, in the first half of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2012, we experienced delivery issues with suppliers of silicon wafers, cells, connectors and encapsulants that caused us to miss shipment deadlines to some of our customers. Delivery problems may also occur with suppliers of other components, such as silver metallization paste, low-iron glass and solar module back sheet. The failure of a supplier, for whatever reason, to supply silicon wafers, solar cells, silicon raw materials or other essential components that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could impair our ability to manufacture our products or increase our costs. The impact could be more severe 19 Table of Contents if we are unable to access alternative sources on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, and could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers in the required quantities and at prices that are profitable. Problems of this kind could cause order cancellations, reduce our market share, harm our reputation and cause legal disputes with our customers. We are developing and commercializing higher conversion efficiency cells, such as selective emitter and metal wrap-through cells, in order to produce higher-powered modules, which may command better prices. We cannot assure that we will be able to mass-produce these cells in a cost effective way, if at all. Higher efficiency cell structures are becoming an increasingly important factor in cost competitiveness and brand recognition in the solar power industry. Such cells may yield higher power outputs at the same cost to produce as lower efficiency cells, thereby lowering the manufactured cost per watt. The ability to manufacture and sell modules made from such cells may also be an important competitive advantage because system owners can obtain a higher yield of electricity from the modules that have a similar infrastructure, footprint and system cost compared to systems with modules using lower efficiency cells. Higher conversion efficiency solar cells and the resulting higher output modules are also one of the considerations in maintaining a price premium over thin-film products. However, while we are making the necessary capital equipment and other investments to develop higher conversion efficiency products, there is no assurance that we will be able to commercialize some or any of these products in a cost effective way, or at all. In the near term, such products may command a modest premium. In the longer term, if our competitors are able to manufacture such products and we cannot do the same at all or in a cost efficient manner, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which will likely influence our product pricing and our financial performance. Since we cannot test our products for the duration of our standard warranty periods, we may be subject to unexpected warranty expense. Before June 2009, we typically sold our standard solar modules with a two-year guarantee for defects in materials and workmanship and a 10-year and 25-year warranty against declines of more than 10% and 20%, respectively, from the initial minimum power generation capacity at the time of delivery. In June 2009, we increased our warranty against defects in materials and workmanship to six years. Effective August 1, 2011, we increased our warranty against defects in materials and workmanship to ten years and we guarantee that, for a period of 25 years, our modules will maintain the following performance levels: during the first year, the actual power output of the module will be no less than 97% of the labeled power output; from year 2 to year 24, the actual annual power output decline will be no more than 0.7%; and by the end of year 25, the actual power output of the module will be no less than 80% of the labeled power output. We believe our warranty periods are consistent with industry practice. Due to the long warranty period, we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have shipped our products and recognized revenue. We began selling specialty solar modules and products in 2002 and began selling standard solar modules in 2004. Any increase in the defect rate of our products would require us to increase our warranty reserves and would have a corresponding negative impact on our operating results. Although we conduct quality testing and inspection of our solar module products, our solar module products have not been and cannot be tested in an environment simulating the up-to-25-year warranty periods. In particular, unknown issues may surface after extended use. These issues could potentially affect our market reputation and adversely affect our revenues, giving rise to potential warranty claims by our customers. As a result, we may be subject to unexpected warranty costs and associated harm to our financial results as long as 25 years after the sale of our products. 20 Table of Contents In addition to the solar module warranty above, for utility-scale solar power projects built by us, we provide a limited warranty against defects in workmanship under normal use, operation and service conditions for a period of five years following the energizing of the solar power plant. In resolving claims under the workmanship warranty, we have the option of remedying through repair, refurbishment or replacement of equipment. In April 2010, we began entering into agreements with insurance companies to reduce some of this risk. Under the insurance policies, the insurance companies are obliged to reimburse us, subject to certain maximum claim limits and certain deductibles, for the actual product warranty costs that we incur under the terms of our warranty policy. The warranty insurance is renewable annually. See "Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewInsurance." However, we cannot assure that potential warranty claims will not exceed the scope or amount of coverage under this insurance and, if they do, they could materially and adversely affect our business. We may not continue to be successful in developing and maintaining a cost-effective solar cell manufacturing capability. We plan to continue expanding our in-house solar cell manufacturing capabilities to support our core solar module manufacturing business. We expanded our annual solar cell production capacity from 800 MW as of December 31, 2010 to 1.5 GW as of December 31, 2011 and 1.6 GW as of December 31, 2012. To remain competitive going forward, we intend to further expand our total annual solar cell production capacity. However, we only have limited and recent operating experience in this area and may face significant product development challenges in our solar cell operations. Manufacturing solar cells is a complex process and we may not be able to produce solar cells of sufficient quality to meet our solar module manufacturing standards. Minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yield and in some cases cause no yield output or production to be suspended. We will need to make capital expenditures to purchase manufacturing equipment for solar cell production and will also need to make significant investments in research and development to keep pace with technological advances in solar power technology. The technologies, designs and customer preferences for solar cells can change rapidly, and solar cell product life cycles are shorter than those for solar modules. We also face increased costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Any failure to successfully develop and maintain cost-effective solar cell manufacturing capability may have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects. For example, we have in the past purchased a large percentage of solar cells from third parties. This negatively affected our margins compared with those of our competitors since it is less expensive to produce cells internally than to purchase them from third parties. Because third party solar cell purchases are usually made in a period of high demand, prices tend to be higher and availability reduced. Although we intend to continue direct purchasing of solar cells and toll manufacturing arrangements through a limited number of strategic partners, our relationships with our solar cell suppliers may be disrupted if we engage in the large-scale production of solar cells ourselves. If solar cell suppliers discontinue or reduce the supply of solar cells to us, through direct sales or through toll manufacturing arrangements, and we are not able to compensate for the loss or reduction by manufacturing our own solar cells, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. It may be difficult to develop our internal production capabilities for silicon ingots and wafers or to achieve acceptable yields and product performance as a result of manufacturing problems. We have been increasing our internal production capabilities for the manufacture of silicon ingots and wafers. We completed the initial phase of our silicon ingot and wafer plant in the third quarter of 2008 and reached a nameplate capacity of approximately 216 MW as of December 31, 2012. We have limited prior operational experience in ingot and silicon wafer production and will face significant challenges in further increasing our internal production capabilities. The technology is complex and will 21 Table of Contents require costly equipment and hiring of highly skilled personnel. In addition, we may experience delays in further developing these capabilities and in obtaining the governmental permits required to carry on these operations. If we are able to develop these production capabilities successfully, we will need to continuously enhance and modify these capabilities in order to improve yields and product performance. Microscopic impurities such as dust and other contaminants, difficulties in the manufacturing process, disruptions in the supply of utilities or defects in the key materials and tools used to manufacture silicon wafers can cause a percentage of the silicon wafers to be rejected, which would negatively affect our yields. We may experience manufacturing difficulties that cause production delays and lower than expected yields. Problems in our facilities, including but not limited to production failures, construction delays, human errors, weather conditions, equipment malfunction or process contamination, may limit our ability to manufacture products, which could seriously harm our operations. We are also susceptible to floods, droughts, power losses and similar events beyond our control that would affect our facilities. A disruption in any step of the manufacturing process will require us to repeat each step and recycle the silicon debris, which would adversely affect our yields and manufacturing cost. Our future growth depends in part on our ability to make strategic acquisitions and investments and to establish and maintain strategic relationships, and our failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect on our market penetration and revenue growth. We may acquire other businesses, make strategic investments or establish strategic relationships with third parties to improve our market position or expand our products and services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully make strategic acquisitions and investments or establish strategic relationships with third parties that will prove to be effective for our business. Our inability to do so could materially and adversely affect our market penetration, our revenue growth and our profitability. Investments, strategic acquisitions and relationships with third parties could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information and loss of control of operations that are material to our business. Moreover, strategic acquisitions, investments and relationships may be expensive to implement and subject us to the risk of non-performance by a counterparty, which may in turn lead to monetary losses that materially and adversely affect our business. If we are unable to attract, train and retain technical personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, train and retain technical personnel. Recruiting and retaining capable personnel, particularly those with expertise in the solar power industry, are vital to our success. There is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain sufficient technical personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be materially and adversely affected. 22 Table of Contents Our dependence on a limited number of customers and our lack of long-term customer contracts may cause significant fluctuations or declines in our revenues. We sell a substantial portion of our solar module products to a limited number of customers, including distributors, system integrators, project developers and installers who either integrate our products into their own products or sell them as part of their product portfolio. Our top five customers by revenues collectively accounted for approximately 26.0%, 29.2% and 21.6% of our net revenues in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. We typically enter into one-year framework sales agreements with our customers, with quarterly firm orders stipulating prices and quantities. We anticipate that our dependence on a limited number of customers will continue for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any of the following events may cause material fluctuations or declines in our revenues: reduced, delayed or cancelled orders from one or more of our significant customers; the loss of one or more of our significant customers; a significant customer's failure to pay for our products on time; and a significant customer's financial problems or insolvency. As we continue to expand our business and operations, our top customers continue to change. We cannot assure that we will be able to develop a consistent customer base. Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages. We, along with other solar module product manufacturers, are exposed to risks associated with product liability claims if the use of our solar module products results in injury. Since our products generate electricity, it is possible that users could be injured or killed by our products due to product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. We shipped our first products in March 2002 and, because of our limited operating history, we cannot predict whether product liability claims will be brought against us in the future, or the effect of any resulting negative publicity on our business. Although we carry limited product liability insurance, we may not have adequate resources to satisfy a judgment if a successful claim is brought against us. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages and require us to make significant payments. Even if the product liability claims against us are determined in our favor, we may suffer significant damage to our reputation. Our founder, Dr. Shawn Qu, has substantial influence over our company and his interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders. As of March 31, 2013, Dr. Shawn Qu, our founder, chairman, president and chief executive officer, beneficially owned 13,270,500 common shares, or 30.5% of our outstanding share capital. As a result, Dr. Qu has substantial influence over our business, including decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, the election of directors and other significant corporate actions. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our common shares. We may be exposed to infringement, misappropriation or other claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay significant damage awards. Our success depends on our ability to use and develop our technology and know-how and sell our solar module products without infringing the intellectual property or other rights of third parties. The 23 Table of Contents validity and scope of claims relating to solar power technology patents involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analyses and are therefore highly uncertain. We may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or the violation of intellectual property rights of third parties. Defending intellectual property suits, patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time-consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel. Additionally, we use both imported and China-made equipment in our production lines, sometimes without sufficient supplier guarantees that our use of such equipment does not infringe third-party intellectual property rights. This creates a potential source of litigation or infringement claims. An adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties, pay ongoing royalties, redesign our products or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our products or the use of our technologies. Protracted litigation could also defer customers or potential customers or limit their purchase or use of our products until such litigation is resolved. Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages, fines and the suspension or even termination of our business operations. We are required to comply with all national and local environmental regulations. As we expanded our silicon reclamation program and research and development activities and moved into ingot, wafer and cell manufacturing, we began to generate material levels of noise, wastewater, gaseous wastes and other industrial waste in our business operations. Additionally, as we expanded our internal solar components production capacity, our risk of facility incidents with a potential environmental impact also increased. We believe that we comply with all environmental laws and regulations and have all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business as it is presently conducted. However, if more stringent regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of complying with these new regulations could be substantial. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations, we may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. Any failure by us to control our use or to restrict adequately the discharge, of hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages, fines or suspensions of our business operations. Our solar modules and products must comply with the environmental regulations of the jurisdictions in which they are installed, and we may incur expenses to design and manufacture our products to comply with such regulations. For example, we increased our expenditures to comply with the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, which took effect in July 2006, by reducing the amount of lead and other restricted substances in our solar module products. Furthermore, we may need to comply with the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive if solar modules and products are re-classified as consumer electronics under the directive or if our customers located in other markets demand that they comply with this directive. This would require us to implement manufacturing process changes, such as changing the soldering materials used in module manufacturing, in order to continue to sell our products in these markets. If compliance is unduly expensive or unduly difficult, we may lose market share and our financial results may be adversely affected. We may not be successful in establishing our brand name in important markets and the products we sell under our brand name may compete with the products we manufacture on an original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, basis for our customers. We sell our products primarily under our own brand name but also on an OEM basis. In certain markets, our brand may not be as prominent as other more established solar power vendors, and there can be no assurance that the "CSI" or "Canadian Solar" brand name or any of our possible future 24 Table of Contents brand names will gain acceptance among customers. Moreover, because the range of products that we sell under our own brands and those we manufacture for our OEM customers may be substantially similar, we cannot assure that we will not directly or indirectly compete with our OEM customers, which could negatively affect our relationship with them. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights in connection with new specialty solar modules and products may undermine our competitive position. As we develop and bring to market new specialty solar modules and products, we may need to increase our expenditures to protect our intellectual property. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position. We currently have 151 patents and 133 patent applications pending in the PRC for products that contribute a relatively small percentage of our net revenues. We have two United States patents, issued in November 2009 and February 2010. We also have three patent applications pending in Europe. We applied for registration of the "Canadian Solar" trademark in the United States in March 2009 and subsequently in a number of other jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, Europe, India, South Korea, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Ghana, Croatia, Israel, Kenya, Liechtenstein, Singapore, Morocco, Egypt, Vietnam, Turkey, South Africa, Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among these applications, the "Canadian Solar" trademark has been registered in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, South Korea, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. We also have 56 registered trademarks and 11 trademark applications pending in the PRC, and 25 registered trademarks and 41 trademark applications pending outside of China. These intellectual property rights afford only limited protection and the actions we take to protect our rights as we develop new specialty solar modules and products may not be adequate. Policing the unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. In addition, litigation, which can be costly and divert management attention, may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. If our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filing may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. We are subject to the reporting obligations under U.S. securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on its internal control over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains management's assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm must report on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting. As of December 31, 2012, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as well. However, we cannot assure that material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any material weaknesses in our internal controls could cause us not to meet our periodic reporting obligations in a timely manner or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our share price. We face risks related to an SEC subpoena and private securities litigation. We received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents relating to, among other things, certain sales transactions in 2009. We cannot predict when the SEC will complete its investigation or what its outcome will be. In addition, our company and certain of our directors and executive officers 25 Table of Contents have been named as defendants in class action lawsuits in the United States and Canada. The lawsuits in the United States were consolidated into one class action, which was recently dismissed with prejudice. The lawsuit in Canada continues. As a preliminary matter, we challenged the Ontario Court's jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's claim, but this motion was unsuccessful. The plaintiff is now pursuing his motion for class certification and for court approval to assert the statutory cause of action under the Ontario Securities Act. The plaintiff's motions will be heard by the court in June 2013. There is no guarantee that we will not become party to additional lawsuits or appeals to lawsuits that have been dismissed. See "Item 8. Financial InformationA. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial InformationLegal and Administrative Proceedings." We are generally obligated, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify our directors and officers who are named defendants in these lawsuits. We may be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses in aggregate amounts that could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Risks Related to Doing Business in China The enforcement of the labor contract law and increases in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our profitability. The Labor Contract Law came into effect on January 1, 2008, and the Implementation Rules thereunder were promulgated and became effective on September 18, 2008. The Labor Contract Law and the Implementation Rules imposed stringent requirements on employers with regard to executing written employment contracts, hiring temporary employees, and dismissing employees. In addition, under the Regulations on Paid Annual Leave for Employees, which came into effect on January 1, 2008, and their Implementation Measures, which were promulgated and became effective on September 18, 2008, employees who have served for more than one year with an employer are entitled to a paid vacation ranging from five to 15 days, depending on their length of service. Employees who waive such vacation time at the request of the employer must be compensated for each vacation day waived at a rate equal to three times their normal daily salary. Our labor costs are expected to continue to increase due to these new laws and regulations. Higher labor costs and labor disputes with our employees stemming from these new rules and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. A change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business. A number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to the interpretation of transfer pricing standards; changes in available tax credits; changes in stock-based compensation expenses; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (for example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform); changes in U.S. GAAP; expiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. A change in our effective tax rate due to any of these factors may adversely influence our future results from operations. In recent years, our subsidiaries have lost certain tax benefits and we expect to pay additional PRC taxes as a result, which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. On January 1, 2008, the Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, came into effect in China. Under the EIT Law, both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises are subject to a uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25%. There is a transition period for enterprises that were established prior to March 16, 2007 (the promulgation date of the EIT Law) and were given preferential tax treatment under the previous tax law. Enterprises that were subject to an enterprise income tax rate lower than 25% will have the new uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25% phased 26 Table of Contents in over a five-year period from the effective date of the EIT Law. Enterprises that were entitled to exemptions or reductions from the standard enterprise income tax rate for a fixed term may continue to enjoy such treatment until the fixed term expires, subject to certain limitations. The EIT Law provides for preferential tax treatment for certain categories of industries and projects that are strongly supported and encouraged by the state. For example, enterprises classified as a "High and New Technology Enterprise," or HNTE, are entitled to a 15% enterprise income tax rate provided that such HNTE satisfies other applicable statutory requirements. Our subsidiary, CSI Solartronics (Changshu) Co., Ltd., or CSI Solartronics, has been recognized as an HNTE. However, because it does not satisfy certain requirements for the reduced 15% enterprise income tax rate, CSI Solartronics is still subject to a 25% enterprise income tax rate. CSI Solar Manufacture Inc., or CSI Manufacturing, was subject to a reduced enterprise income tax rate of 12.5% to the end of 2009, when its tax holiday expired. CSI Cells Co. Ltd., or CSI Cells and Canadian Solar Manufacturing (Luoyang) Inc., or CSI Luoyang Manufacturing, were subject to a reduced enterprise income tax rate of 12.5% until the end of 2011, when their tax holidays expired. Currently, CSI Cells is subject to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% for the three years from 2012 to 2014, resulting from its HNTE status recognized in 2009 and renewed in 2012. Canadian Solar Manufacturing (Changshu) Inc. (formerly known as Changshu CSI Advanced Solar Inc.), or CSI Changshu Manufacturing, was exempt from enterprise income tax for 2009 and was subject to a reduced enterprise income tax rate of 12.5% for 2010, 2011 and 2012, at which time its tax holiday expired as well. As the preferential tax benefits enjoyed by our PRC subsidiaries expired, their effective tax rates increased significantly. There are significant uncertainties in our tax liabilities regarding our income under the EIT Law. We are a Canadian company with substantially all of our manufacturing operations in China. Under the EIT Law and its implementation regulations, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008, enterprises established outside China whose "effective management" is located in China are considered PRC tax residents and will generally be subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on their global income. Under the implementation regulations, the term "effective management" is defined as substantial and overall management and control over aspects such as the production and business, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. Currently there are no detailed rules or precedents governing the procedures and specific criteria for determining a company's effective management, which are applicable to us. As a substantial number of the members of our management team are located in China, we may be considered as a PRC tax resident under the EIT Law and, therefore, subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on our global income. If our global income is subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25%, our financial condition and results of operation may be materially and adversely affected. Dividends payable by us to our non-Chinese shareholders and gains on the sale of our common shares may become subject to PRC enterprise income tax liabilities. The implementation regulations of the EIT Law provide that (i) if the enterprise that distributes dividends is domiciled in the PRC or (ii) if gains are realized from transferring equity interests of enterprises domiciled in the PRC, then such dividends or capital gains will be treated as China-sourced income. Also, income sourced within China is determined based on the following principles for equity interest transfers and dividends: (x) for income from transfers of equity interests, source is determined in accordance with the place where the invested enterprise is located; and (y) for income from equity interests such as dividends and profit distributions, source is determined in accordance with the place of the enterprise which makes the distribution. Currently there are no detailed rules or precedents governing the procedures and specific criteria for determining what it means to be domiciled in the PRC. As a result, it is not clear how the concept 27 Table of Contents of "China domicile" will be interpreted under the EIT Law. The concept of domicile may be interpreted simply as the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a tax resident. Therefore, if we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders as well as any gains realized by such shareholders from the transfer of our common shares may be regarded as China-sourced income and, consequently, be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%. The investment returns of our overseas investors, and the value of their investments in us, may be materially and adversely affected if any dividends we pay to them, or any gains realized by them on the transfer of our common shares are subject to PRC withholding tax. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues effectively. Certain of our revenues and expenses are denominated in Renminbi. If our revenues denominated in Renminbi increase or our expenses denominated in Renminbi decrease in the future, we may need to convert a portion of our revenues into other currencies to meet our foreign currency obligations, including, among others, payment of dividends, if any, in respect of our common shares. Under China's existing foreign exchange regulations, our PRC subsidiaries are able to pay dividends in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, we cannot assure that the PRC government will not take further measures in the future to restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions. Foreign exchange transactions by our PRC subsidiaries under most capital accounts continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of PRC governmental authorities. In particular, if we finance our PRC subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, certain government authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts, must approve these capital contributions. These limitations could affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to obtain foreign exchange through equity financing. Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could materially and adversely affect us. We conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations through our subsidiaries in China. These subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system is still developing, the implementation and enforcement of many laws, regulations and rules may be inconsistent, which may limit legal protections available to us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and divert our resources and the attention of our management. Risks Related to Our Common Shares The market price for our common stocks may be volatile. The market price for our common shares has been highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. During the period from November 9, 2006, the first day on which our common shares were listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, until December 31, 2012, the market price of our common shares ranged from $1.95 to $51.80 per share. The closing market price of our common shares on December 31, 2012 was $3.40 per share. The market price of our common shares may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to a wide variety of factors, including the following: announcements of technological or competitive developments; 28 Table of Contents regulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, our customers or our competitors; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other solar power companies; the departure of executive officers and key research personnel; patent litigation and other intellectual property disputes; litigation and other disputes with our long-term suppliers; fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar, the Euro and the RMB; SEC investigations or private securities litigation; the release or expiration of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding common shares; and sales or anticipated sales of additional common shares. In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common shares. Substantial future sales of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause the price of our common shares to decline. Sales of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common shares to decline. As of December 31, 2012, we had 43,242,426 common shares outstanding. The number of common shares outstanding and available for sale will increase when our employees and former employees who are holders of restricted share units and options to acquire our common shares become entitled to the underlying shares under the terms of their units or options. To the extent these shares are sold into the market, the market price of our common shares could decline. Your right to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings. We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make these rights available in the United States unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings. 29 Table of Contents Our articles of continuance contain anti-takeover provisions that could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common shares. The following provisions in our amended articles of continuance may deprive our shareholders of the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price by delaying or preventing a change of control of our company: Our board of directors has the authority, without approval from the shareholders, to issue an unlimited number of preferred shares in one or more series. Our board of directors may establish the number of shares to be included in each such series and may fix the designations, preferences, powers and other rights of the shares of a series of preferred shares. Our board of directors is entitled to fix and may change the number of directors within the minimum and maximum number of directors provided for in our articles. Our board of directors may appoint one or more additional directors to hold office for a term expiring no later than the close of the next annual meeting of shareholders, subject to the limitation that the total number of directors so appointed may not exceed one-third of the number of directors elected at the previous annual meeting of shareholders. You may have difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us. We are a corporation organized under the laws of Canada and a substantial portion of our assets is located outside of the United States. A substantial portion of our current business operations is conducted in the PRC. In addition, a majority of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. court judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, many of whom are not residents of the United States and whose assets are located in significant part outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Canada or the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state. In addition, it is uncertain whether such Canadian or PRC courts would be competent to hear original actions brought in Canada or the PRC against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state. We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of our common shares. Based on the market price of our common shares, the value of our assets and the composition of our income and assets, we do not believe we were a "passive foreign investment company," or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. However, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to uncertainty in several respects, and we cannot assure you the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will not take a contrary position. A non-U.S. corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. A separate determination must be made after the close of each taxable year as to whether we were a PFIC for that year. Because the value of our assets for purposes of the PFIC test will generally be determined by reference to the market price of our common shares, fluctuations in the market price of the common shares may cause us to become a PFIC. In addition, changes in the composition of our income or assets may cause us to become a PFIC. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined in "Item 10. Additional InformationE. Taxation 30 Table of Contents U.S. Federal Income Taxation") holds a common share, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to such U.S. Holder. See "Item 10. Additional InformationE. TaxationU.S. Federal Income TaxationPassive Foreign Investment Company." The audit report included in this annual report on Form 20-F was prepared by auditors who are not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, as a result, you are deprived of the benefits of such inspection. The independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in our annual reports filed with the SEC, as auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the "PCAOB", is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. Because our auditors are located in the PRC, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the PRC authorities, our auditors are not currently inspected by the PCAOB. Inspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside China have identified deficiencies in those firms' audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditor's audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor's audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. Investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements. Recently, the SEC commenced administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act against the Chinese affiliates of five global accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm. The Rule 102(e) proceedings initiated by the SEC relate to these firms' failure to produce documents, including audit work papers, at the request of the SEC pursuant to Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the auditors located in the PRC are not in a position lawfully to produce documents directly to the SEC because of restrictions under PRC law and specific directives issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC. As the administrative proceedings are ongoing, it is impossible to determine their outcome or their consequences to us. The issues raised by the proceedings are not specific to our independent registered public accounting firm or to us, but affect equally all audit firms based in China and all China-based businesses with securities listed in the United States. However, if the administrative judge were to find in favor of the SEC under the proceedings then, depending upon the remedies sought by the SEC, these audit firms could be barred from practicing before the SEC. As a result, listed companies in the United States with major PRC operations would find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which may result in their delisting. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may erode investor confidence in China-based, United States-listed companies and the market price of our common shares may be adversely affected.
