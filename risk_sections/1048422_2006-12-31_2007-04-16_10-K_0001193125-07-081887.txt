ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial performance, and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, 6 Table of Contents as the forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results and conditions could differ materially from the current expectations. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risk factors as well as other information we include or incorporate by reference in the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission). In addition to other information set forth in this report, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating Access Worldwide and our business. Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These risks could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements contained herein and elsewhere. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or those we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. Risks Related to Our Business We have incurred significant losses over the last three years and we may never achieve or sustain profitability. We have an accumulated deficit of $72.7 million through December 31, 2006, and although we have a net income of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, we may never achieve operating profit. We will need to generate significantly higher revenues to sustain profitability, and we cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues or operating profit to sustain our business. We may not be able to obtain additional capital to fund our operations on reasonable terms and this could hurt our business and negatively impact our stockholders. If adequate funds in the form of equity or debt are not available on reasonable terms or terms acceptable to us in the future, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or additional equity securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced, the securities issued may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms of the securities may impose restrictions on our operations. Ability to pay Convertible Notes and possible dilution. We have limited cash resources and our inability to make principal payments on our Convertible Notes would result in the award of default warrants to each holder of a note, and subsequent dilution. Our Convertible Notes dated December 14, 2004, for $1.15 million (Convertible Notes II), will be due during March of 2008. If Convertible Notes II is not repaid or refinanced, then Convertible Notes II will be in default and will accrue interest at the default rate of 16% retroactive to the issuance date and default warrants will become effective. The default interest will continue to accrue until such time that the Convertible Notes II are repaid or converted. Conversion of the Convertible Notes will significantly dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. If shares of our common stock are issued to the investors upon conversion of all our outstanding Convertible Notes, existing stockholders will have their ownership percentage substantially diluted. The number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the Convertible Notes will also affect our loss or earnings per share on a going-forward basis. The larger the number of shares deemed outstanding, the lower our earnings per share will be. The actual effect of any conversion on our loss or earnings per share will depend on the level of our losses or earnings in future periods, and the actual amount converted pursuant to the Convertible Notes. At December 31, 2006, $3.14 million in principal under Convertible Notes I, amended June 12, 2006, and Convertible Notes II dated December 14, 2004, are convertible into 3.14 million shares of our common stock. On March 17, 2006, we completed the issuance of Convertible Notes IV for approximately $2.5 million of proceeds which is convertible into 5.0 million shares of our common stock. We could be severely impacted by the loss of any of our largest clients. Our three largest clients, AT&T (which consists of AT&T, SBC and Bell South), E*Trade Financial Corporation, and ALL OEM (US Auto Parts Network, Inc.) together accounted for approximately 64% of Access Worldwides revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. There can be no assurance that these clients will continue to do business with us, and the loss of business from any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on us. Our growth is dependent on various factors. Our business and future operations depend significantly on our ability to utilize our existing infrastructure and databases to perform services for new clients, as well as on our ability to develop and successfully implement new marketing methods or channels for new services for existing clients. 7 Table of Contents Continued growth will also depend on a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:  Maintain the high quality of services we provide to customers;  Recruit, motivate and retain qualified personnel;  Train existing sales representatives or recruit new sales representatives to sell various categories of services; and;  Open new service facilities in a timely and cost-effective manner. In light of, among other things, our limited resources, we cannot assure you that we will be able to execute our strategy effectively. Any growth that we would be able to attain would require the implementation of enhanced operational and financial systems and resources, as well as additional management of the resources needed for which we may not have available. Any such growth, if not managed effectively, could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future growth is dependent on the trend toward outsourcing. Our business and future operations depend largely on the industry trend toward outsourcing marketing services. There can be no assurance that this trend will continue, as companies may elect to perform such services internally. A significant change in the direction of this trend could have a material adverse effect on us. The sale of all or substantially all the assets of our TMS Professional Markets Group division could negatively impact our future growth. The TMS Professional Markets Group division was an integral part of Access Worldwides operation. Not only did TMS contribute financially to our operations, it also allowed for a more diversified portfolio of service offerings. Without TMS, we will no longer be able to focus on serving the Pharmaceutical Services segment and will therefore lose those potential revenue streams. We are heavily dependent on the industries we serve, particularly the telecommunications industries. Our business and future operations are dependent to a great extent on the industries we serve. There can be no assurance that the telecommunications industry will grow or that it will continue to utilize entities such as Access Worldwide for outsourced marketing services. In addition, there can be no assurance that our business will benefit from any growth that these industries experience. These industries are heavily regulated by federal and state authorities. Existing regulation, or increased regulation in the future, could negatively impact the ability of the industries to operate or grow. Anything that inhibits the operations or growth of the telecommunications industry could have a material adverse effect on us. We rely on technology and could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain facilities with the needed equipment. We have invested significant funds in specialized telecommunications and computer technologies and equipment to provide customized solutions to meet our clients needs. In addition, we have invested significantly in sophisticated proprietary databases and software that enable us to market our clients products to targeted markets. We anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to select, invest in and develop new and enhanced technology and proprietary databases on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain our competitiveness. We have leased equipment and have expended substantial time and resources to train our personnel in the operation of our existing equipment and to integrate the operations of our systems and facilities. In the event of substantial improvements in computer technologies and telecommunications equipment, we may be required to acquire such new technologies and equipment at significant cost and/or phase out a portion of our existing equipment. There can be no assurance that our technologies and equipment will not be rendered obsolete or our services rendered less marketable. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop and maintain the technology and systems necessary for our business. We are dependent on key personnel and may be affected by changes in senior management. Our success depends in large part upon the abilities and continued service of our key management personnel. Our failure to retain the services of all of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in order to support any growth that we are able to effectuate, we will be required to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel. In light of our limited resources, we cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel. Our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 8 Table of Contents We are dependent on our labor force and could be affected by potentially high turnover rates. Many aspects of our business are labor intensive, and based on the transient nature of our work force, there is a potential for high personnel turnover. Our operations typically require specially trained persons, such as those employees who market services and products in languages other than English. A higher turnover rate among our employees would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease operating efficiencies and productivity. In addition, any growth in our business will require us to recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified persons to meet the needs of our business. We could be affected by a business interruption. Our business is highly dependent on our computer, software and telephone equipment. The temporary or permanent loss of such systems or equipment, through casualty or operating malfunction, or a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services, could have a material adverse affect on us. Our property and business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for all losses that we may incur in any such event. Our stock price has declined substantially at times in the previous year and may become more volatile. The market price of Access Worldwides common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future as well. During the 2006 fiscal year, our stocks closing price fluctuated from a low of $0.32 to a high of $1.01. During that time period, the average trading volume was 3,001 shares per day, but the volatility of the price is often driven by trading volumes that can total less than 2,000 shares of common stock per day. With this level of volume, small trades can have a significant impact on the price. Additional factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock include:  Future announcements concerning Access Worldwide or our competitors;  Results of technological innovations or service extensions;  Government regulations; and  Changes in general market conditions, particularly in the market for micro-cap stocks. Shortfalls in Access Worldwides revenues or earnings in any given period relative to any expectations in the securities markets could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of the common stock. We have experienced and may experience future quarter to quarter fluctuations in our results of operations. Quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the size and timing of client orders, changes in client budgets, material variations in the cost of telephone services, the demand for our services, the timing of the introduction of new services and service enhancements by us, the market acceptance of new services, competitive conditions in the industries we serve, our ability to effectuate any strategic transactions and general economic conditions. These factors, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in decreasing revenues and earnings, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. We face risk due to our stock trading on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). Because our stock trades on the OTCBB and not on an exchange or the NASDAQ National Market or NASDAQ Capital Market, we have less ability to access the public equity and debt markets, should it be necessary or advisable to do so, than if our stock traded on one of those other more recognizable trading venues. We face a risk that we may not be able to successfully operate our communication center in Manila, Philippines. Our communication centers in the Philippines have only been open for less than two years, and represent our first off-shore presence. These centers required substantial investment, the establishment of a Philippines management team, and securing contracts to perform work in these facilities. The inability to continue to execute one or all of the above items would have a material adverse effect on us. Risks Related to Our Industry We may be adversely impacted by competition, industry consolidation and potential consumer saturation. The outsourced marketing services industry in which we operate is very competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with other BPO and outsourced marketing services companies, ranging in size from very small companies offering specialized applications or short-term projects to large independent companies. While many companies provide outsourced marketing services, we believe that there is no single company that dominates the entire industry. A significant number of our competitors and potential competitors have more extensive marketing capabilities, more extensive experience and greater financial resources than us. Consolidation among prospective clients also increases competition for buyers of our services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect us. 9 Table of Contents We were impacted by the events of September 11, 2001 and may be impacted in the future by events of a similar nature, war and other international conflicts. Our businesses were impacted by the events of September 11, 2001 when we experienced, among other things, lost production days at our communication centers. To the extent that there are any further events of a nature similar to that of September 11, 2001, war and other international conflicts, or a prolonged downturn in the U.S. economy, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We are subject to extensive regulations and compliance with these regulations can be costly, time consuming and subject us to fines for non-compliance. Several industries in which our clients operate are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation, in particular the telecommunications industry. Generally, compliance with these regulations is the responsibility of our clients. However, we are exposed to a variety of enforcement or private actions for our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with such regulations. Our communication centers must comply with a variety of regulations. We believe our operating procedures comply with the telephone solicitation rules of the FCC and FTC. However, we cannot assure you that additional federal or state legislation, or changes in regulatory implementation, would not limit the activities of the Company or our clients in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. In addition, the majority of states require outbound telemarketers to comply with various registration and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with the registration requirements could result in fines and call prohibitions which could have a material adverse effect on us.
