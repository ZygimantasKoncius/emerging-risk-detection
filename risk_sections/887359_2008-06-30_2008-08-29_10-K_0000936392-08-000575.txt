Risk Factors. Because the factors referred to in the preceding paragraph could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we make, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding:  potential strategic collaborations with others  future capital needs  adequacy of existing capital to support operations for a specified time  product development and marketing plan  clinical trial plans and anticipated results  anticipation of future losses 24 Table of Contents  replacement of manufacturing sources  commercialization plans  revenue expectations and operating results Item 1B.
