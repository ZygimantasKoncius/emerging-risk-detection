BUSINESS General Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc., referred to throughout this document as we, us, our, the Company or Humana, is one of the nations largest publicly traded health benefits companies, based on our 2006 revenues of $21.4 billion. We offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and consumer-choice plans for government-sponsored programs, employer groups, and individuals. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 11.3 million members in our medical benefit programs, as well as approximately 1.9 million members in our specialty products programs. During 2006, 67% of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government, including 17% related to our contracts in Florida with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and 12% related to our TRICARE contracts. Under our CMS contracts in Florida, we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 518,900 members as of December 31, 2006. We were organized as a Delaware corporation in 1964. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 West Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, the telephone number at that address is (502) 580-1000, and our website address is www.humana.com. We adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, on January 1, 2006. We have adjusted prior period amounts to reflect the effect of expensing stock awards under the modified retrospective application method of SFAS 123R as discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains both historical and forward-looking information. See Item 1A.Risk Factors for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results or business. Business Segments We manage our business with two segments: Government and Commercial. The Government segment consists of members enrolled in government-sponsored programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare, TRICARE, and Medicaid. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals, and includes two lines of business: medical (fully and self insured) and specialty. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, or SFAS 131, which is consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer in managing our business. The segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing, benefits and underwriting requirements. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other income, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We believe our customer, membership, revenue, and pretax income diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success. 3 Table of Contents Our Products As more fully described in the products discussion that follows, we provide health insurance benefits under health maintenance organization, or HMO, Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, and preferred provider organization, or PPO, plans. The following table presents our segment membership at December 31, 2006, and premiums and administrative services only, or ASO, fees by product for the year ended December 31, 2006: MedicalMembership SpecialtyMembership Premiums ASO Fees TotalPremiums andASO Fees Percent ofTotalPremiumsand ASOFees (dollars in thousands) Government: Medicare Advantage: HMO 457,900  $ 4,869,044 $  $ 4,869,044 23.1 % PFFS 473,000  3,136,200  3,136,200 14.9 % PPO 71,700  493,820  493,820 2.3 % Total Medicare Advantage 1,002,600  8,499,064  8,499,064 40.3 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 3,536,600  3,050,304  3,050,304 14.5 % Total Medicare 4,539,200  11,549,368  11,549,368 54.8 % Medicaid 390,700  520,520  520,520 2.5 % Medicaid ASO 178,400   1,423 1,423  % Total Medicaid 569,100  520,520 1,423 521,943 2.5 % TRICARE 1,716,400  2,543,930  2,543,930 12.1 % TRICARE ASO 1,163,600   48,019 48,019 0.2 % Total TRICARE 2,880,000  2,543,930 48,019 2,591,949 12.3 % Total Government 7,988,300  14,613,818 49,442 14,663,260 69.6 % Commercial: Fully insured: PPO 1,246,500  3,684,442  3,684,442 17.4 % HMO 507,700  2,019,936  2,019,936 9.6 % Total fully insured 1,754,200  5,704,378  5,704,378 27.0 % ASO 1,529,600   291,769 291,769 1.4 % Specialty  1,902,800 410,986  410,986 2.0 % Total Commercial 3,283,800 1,902,800 6,115,364 291,769 6,407,133 30.4 % Total 11,272,100 1,902,800 $ 20,729,182 $ 341,211 $ 21,070,393 100.0 % Our Products Marketed to Government Segment Members and Beneficiaries Medicare Advantage Products Medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits. Hospitalization benefits are provided under Part A, without the payment of any premium, for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days. Eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under Part B. Beneficiaries eligible for Part A and Part B coverage under traditional Medicare are still required to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Prescription drug benefits are provided under Part D. CMS, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, administers the Medicare program. 4 Table of Contents We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs to Medicare eligible persons under HMO, PPO, and PFFS plans in exchange for contractual payments received from CMS, usually a fixed payment per member per month. We refer to beneficiaries enrolled in these plans collectively as Medicare Advantage or MA-PD members. With each of these products, the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of traditional Medicare, typically including reduced cost sharing, enhanced prescription drug benefits, care coordination, data mining techniques to help identify member needs, complex case management, tools to guide members in their health care decisions, disease management programs, wellness and prevention programs, and a reduced monthly Part B premium. Since 2006, Medicare beneficiaries have had more health plan options, including a prescription drug benefit option and greater access to a PPO offering with the roll-out of Regional PPO plans. Prior to 2006, PPO plans were offered on a local basis only. Most Medicare Advantage plans must offer the prescription drug benefit under Part D as part of the basic plan, subject to cost sharing and other limitations. Accordingly, all of the provisions of the Medicare Part D program described in connection with our stand-alone prescription drug plans in the following section are also applicable to our Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for Medicare-covered services or for certain extra benefits. Our Medicare HMO and PPO plans, which cover Medicare-eligible individuals residing in certain counties, may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating in-network providers, or in emergency situations. Except in emergency situations, HMO plans provide no out-of-network benefits. PPO plans carry an out-of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost-sharing. In many cases, these beneficiaries also may be required to pay a monthly premium to the HMO or PPO plan, in addition to the monthly Part B premium they are required to pay the Medicare program. Our Medicare PFFS plans have no preferred network. Individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical Medicare Advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at reimbursement rates equivalent to traditional Medicare payment rates. CMS uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans. These rates are adjusted under CMSs risk adjustment model which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to improve the accuracy of payment. The risk adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits and Improvement Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings (hospital outpatient department and physician visits). CMS has transitioned to this risk-based reimbursement model while the old reimbursement model based on demographic data including gender, age, and disability status was phased out. In 2006, the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 75%, from 50% in 2005. The phase-in of risk adjusted payment has increased to 100% in 2007. Under the risk adjustment methodology, all health benefit organizations must capture, collect, and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. Commensurate with phase-in of the risk-adjustment methodology, payments to Medicare Advantage plans were increased by a budget neutrality factor. The budget neutrality factor was implemented to prevent overall health plan payments from being reduced during the transition from the previous reimbursement model, based upon average original Medicare fee-for-service spending, to the risk-adjustment payment model. The payment adjustments for budget neutrality were first developed in 2002 and first used with the 2003 payments. The budget neutrality adjustment began phasing out in 2007 and will be fully eliminated by 2011. This does not mean, however, that the aggregate per-member payments to Medicare plans will be reduced. As plans enroll less healthy beneficiaries, the need for the budget neutrality adjustment declines as the underlying risk adjusted Medicare rates paid to plans increase to account for their enrollees greater healthcare needs. As a result of changes in the CMS payment processes, including the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology and the phasing out of the budget neutrality adjustment described previously, our CMS payments per member may change materially, either favorably or unfavorably. 5 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, we provided health insurance coverage under CMS contracts to approximately 1,002,600 MA-PD members for which we received premium revenues of approximately $8.5 billion, or 40.3% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006. Under our Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS in Florida, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 324,600 members. These contracts accounted for premium revenues of approximately $3.5 billion, which represented approximately 41.2% of our Medicare Advantage premium revenues, or 16.6% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our HMO, PFFS, and PPO products covered under Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a one-year term each December 31 unless CMS notifies Humana of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the contract year, or Humana notifies CMS of its decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the contract year. Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Products On January 1, 2006, we began offering stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under Medicare Part D. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our three plan choices between November 15 and December 31 for coverage that begins January 1. The enrollment period was extended to May 31 during 2006 because it was the first year of the program. Our stand-alone PDP offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by Congress, as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of out-of-pocket costs for premiums, deductibles and co-insurance. Our revenues from CMS and the beneficiary are determined from our bids submitted annually to CMS. These revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described beginning on page 55. Our stand-alone PDP contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a one-year term each December 31 unless CMS notifies Humana of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the contract year, or Humana notifies CMS of its decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the contract year. Medicare Presence We now have a national presence, offering our Medicare PFFS and stand-alone PDP products in all 50 states. The following table sets forth the number of markets in which we sold our Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP products as of January 1, 2007, as compared with January 1, 2006 and 2005: 2007 2006 2005 PFFS (states) 50 35 35 HMO (localities) 12 12 12 Regional PPO (states) 23 23  Local PPO (localities) 26 33 30 Stand-alone PDP (states) 50 46  In addition, we market our HMO and PFFS products in Puerto Rico as well as our stand-alone PDP products in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Medicaid Product Medicaid is a federal program that is state-operated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to low-income residents. Each electing state develops, through a state specific regulatory agency, a Medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by CMS. CMS requires that Medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable fee-for-service basis. States currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program. In either case, the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a one-year period. Under these contracts, we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to 6 Table of Contents enrolled members. Due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints, more states are utilizing a managed care product in their Medicaid programs. Our Medicaid business, which accounted for approximately 2.5% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisted of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida, with the Puerto Rico contract representing 75.2% of total Medicaid premiums and ASO fees. TRICARE TRICARE provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents. Currently, three health benefit options are available to TRICARE beneficiaries. In addition to a traditional indemnity option, participants may enroll in an HMO-like plan with a point-of-service option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers, similar to a PPO. We have participated in the TRICARE program since 1996 under contracts with the United States Department of Defense. Our current TRICARE South Region contract, which we were awarded in 2003, covers approximately 2.9 million eligible beneficiaries as of December 31, 2006 in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma. The South Region is one of the three regions in the United States as defined by the Department of Defense. Of these eligible beneficiaries, 1.2 million were TRICARE ASO members representing active duty beneficiaries, seniors over the age of 65 and beneficiaries in Puerto Rico for which the Department of Defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit. The TRICARE South Region contract is for a five-year period subject to annual renewals at the federal governments option, with the fourth option period scheduled to begin April 1, 2007. We have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract. The TRICARE South Region contract contains provisions that require us to negotiate a target health care cost amount annually with the federal government. Any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government. As such, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business. These changes may include, for example, an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal governments decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. For the year ended December 31, 2006, TRICARE premium revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, or 12.1% of our total premiums and ASO fees, and TRICARE ASO fees totaled $48.0 million, or 0.2% of our total premiums and ASO fees. Our Products Marketed to Commercial Segment Employers and Members Consumer-Choice Products Over the last several years, we have developed and offered various commercial products designed to provide options and choices to employers that are annually facing substantial premium increases driven by double-digit medical cost inflation. These consumer-choice products, which can be offered on either a fully insured or ASO basis, provided coverage to approximately 437,900 members at December 31, 2006, representing approximately 13.3% of our total commercial medical membership as detailed below. Consumer-ChoiceMembership Other CommercialMembership CommercialMedical Membership Fully insured 231,900 1,522,300 1,754,200 ASO 206,000 1,323,600 1,529,600 Total Commercial medical 437,900 2,845,900 3,283,800 7 Table of Contents These products are often offered to employer groups as bundles, where the subscribers are offered various HMO and PPO options, with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the employer. Paramount to our consumer-choice product strategy, we have developed a group of innovative consumer products, styled as Smart products, that we believe will be a long-term solution for employers. We believe this new generation of products provides more (1) choices for the individual consumer, (2) transparency of provider costs, and (3) benefit designs that engage consumers in the costs and effectiveness of health care choices. Innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions, including the trade-offs between higher premiums and point-of-service costs at the time consumers choose their plans, and to suggest ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans. We believe that when consumers can make informed choices about the cost and effectiveness of their health care, a sustainable long term solution for employers can be realized. Smart products, which accounted for approximately 63% of enrollment in all of our consumer-choice plans as of December 31, 2006, are only sold to employers who use Humana as their sole health insurance carrier. Some employers have selected other types of consumer-choice products, such as, (1) a product with a high deductible, (2) a catastrophic coverage plan, or (3) ones that offer a spending account option in conjunction with more traditional medical coverage or as a stand alone plan. Unlike our Smart products, these products, while valuable in helping employers deal with near-term cost increases by shifting costs to employees, are not considered by us to be long-term comprehensive solutions to the employers cost dilemma, although we view them as an important interim step. HMO Our commercial HMO products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians, specialty physicians, and other health care providers who contract with the HMO to furnish such services. Primary care physicians generally include internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians. Generally, the members primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers. These other health care providers include, among others, hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, pharmacies, mental health and substance abuse centers, diagnostic centers, optometrists, outpatient surgery centers, dentists, urgent care centers, and durable medical equipment suppliers. Because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers, the HMO product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit plan. An HMO member, typically through the members employer, pays a monthly fee, which generally covers, together with some copayments, health care services received from, or approved by, the members primary care physician. We participate in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, primarily with our HMO offering in certain markets. FEHBP is the governments health insurance program for Federal employees, retirees, former employees, family members, and spouses. For the year ended December 31, 2006, commercial HMO premium revenues totaled approximately $2.0 billion, or 9.6% of our total premiums and ASO fees. PPO Our commercial PPO products, which are marketed primarily to employer groups and individuals, include some types of wellness and utilization management programs. However, they typically include more cost-sharing with the member, through copayments and annual deductibles. PPOs also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider. In a PPO, the member is encouraged, through financial incentives, to use participating health care providers, which have contracted with the PPO to provide services at favorable rates. In the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider, the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the providers fees. 8 Table of Contents As part of our PPO products, we offer HumanaOne, a major medical product marketed directly to individuals. We offer this product in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels. This individual product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the individual chooses. For the year ended December 31, 2006, employer and individual commercial PPO premium revenues totaled approximately $3.7 billion, or 17.4% of our total premiums and ASO fees. ASO In addition to fully insured consumer-choice, HMO and PPO products, we also offer ASO products to employers who self-insure their employee health plans. We receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded employers. These products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured PPO, HMO or consumer-choice products described previously. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits. However, most ASO customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs. For the year ended December 31, 2006, commercial ASO fees totaled $291.8 million, or 1.4% of our total premiums and ASO fees. Specialty Products We additionally offer various specialty products including dental, life, and short-term disability. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately 1.9 million specialty members, including 1.5 million dental members. For the year ended December 31, 2006, specialty product premium revenues were approximately $411.0 million, or 2.0% of our total premiums and ASO fees. 9 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our total medical membership at December 31, 2006, by market and product: Government Commercial MedicareAdvantage MedicareStand-alonePDP Medicaid TRICARE PPO HMO ASO Total Percentof Total (in thousands) Florida 324.6 194.3 46.0  144.6 152.4 81.4 943.3 8.4 % Texas 56.0 265.5   265.0 60.5 189.4 836.4 7.4 % Kentucky 16.5 72.5   181.0 30.4 484.3 784.7 7.0 % Illinois 45.1 94.2   129.7 73.3 146.4 488.7 4.3 % Ohio 30.6 124.9   64.7 60.4 187.5 468.1 4.2 % Puerto Rico 23.7  344.7  43.7 17.8  429.9 3.8 % Wisconsin 31.5 58.7   70.4 35.6 199.6 395.8 3.5 % Missouri/Kansas 48.8 185.2   33.8 18.9 11.1 297.8 2.6 % California  269.6   1.5   271.1 2.4 % Louisiana 51.7 58.4   34.4 21.1 102.4 268.0 2.4 % Indiana 17.4 111.3   53.0 0.6 50.1 232.4 2.1 % Tennessee 16.7 103.3   30.1  35.9 186.0 1.7 % Georgia 33.2 91.2   23.6 27.1 1.7 176.8 1.6 % Michigan 14.8 107.0   50.0  1.0 172.8 1.5 % North Carolina 41.5 124.5   4.1   170.1 1.5 % Arizona 29.4 50.2   46.6 9.6 27.4 163.2 1.4 % New York  139.1      139.1 1.2 % Pennsylvania 10.6 120.1   3.6   134.3 1.2 % Virginia 35.0 98.4   0.3   133.7 1.2 % Colorado 9.8 41.7   50.9  2.6 105.0 0.9 % Mississippi 11.4 82.9   8.4  0.8 103.5 0.9 % Alabama 7.4 94.1   0.1   101.6 0.9 % Minnesota 26.9 73.8     0.2 100.9 0.9 % Puerto Rico ASO   178.4    7.8 186.2 1.7 % TRICARE    1,716.4    1,716.4 15.2 % TRICARE ASO    1,163.6    1,163.6 10.3 % Others 120.0 975.7   7.0   1,102.7 9.8 % Totals 1,002.6 3,536.6 569.1 2,880.0 1,246.5 507.7 1,529.6 11,272.1 100.0 % Provider Arrangements We provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted, including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers, primary care physicians, specialist physicians, dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities. We have approximately 809,000 contracts with health care providers participating in our networks, which consist of approximately 539,800 physicians, 5,300 hospitals, and 263,900 ancillary providers and dentists. These ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services, medical equipment services, home health agencies, mental health providers, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, optical services, and pharmacies. Our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers. We use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members. These techniques include the coordination of care for our members, product and benefit designs, hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs. The 10 Table of Contents focal point for health care services in many of our HMO networks is the primary care physician who, under contract with us, provides services to our members, and may control utilization of appropriate services, by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers. Some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met. Our hospitalist programs use specially-trained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an HMO members medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the members discharge and post-discharge care. We have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, prenatal and premature infant care, asthma related illness, end stage renal disease, diabetes, cancer, and certain other conditions. We typically contract with hospitals on either (1) a per diem rate, which is an all-inclusive rate per day, (2) a case rate or diagnosis-related groups (DRG), which is an all-inclusive rate per admission, or (3) a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service, ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs, or at a discounted charge. APCs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment. These contracts are often multi-year agreements, with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes. Outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the Medicare allowable fee schedule. Our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year, unless either party gives written notice, generally ranging from 90 to 120 days, to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement. Most of the physicians in our PPO networks and some of our physicians in our HMO networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule, which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard Medicare allowable fee schedule. Capitation For 2.4% of our December 31, 2006 medical membership, we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of HMO membership. In transferring this risk, we prepay these providers a monthly fixed-fee per member, known as a capitation (per capita) payment, to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated HMO membership, including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing. For these capitated HMO arrangements, we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio, or MER, ranging from 82% to 89%. MER measures underwriting profitability and is computed by taking total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues. Providers participating in hospital-based capitated HMO arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their HMO membership. Providers participating in physician-based capitated HMO arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians, and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their HMO membership. For another 4.8% of our December 31, 2006 medical membership, we contract with physicians under risk-sharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their HMO membership. Although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered, we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements. Physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physicians financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis. We monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers. However, we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services. 11 Table of Contents Medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at December 31, 2006 and 2005: Government Segment Commercial Segment TotalMedical MedicareAdvantage MedicareStand-alonePDP TRICARE TRICAREASO Medicaid TotalSegment FullyInsured ASO TotalSegment Medical Membership: December 31, 2006 Capitated HMO hospital system based 29,800     29,800 33,600  33,600 63,400 Capitated HMO physician group based 23,900    148,300 172,200 29,900  29,900 202,100 Risk-sharing 279,300    239,700 519,000 25,900  25,900 544,900 Other 669,600 3,536,600 1,716,400 1,163,600 181,100 7,267,300 1,664,800 1,529,600 3,194,400 10,461,700 Total 1,002,600 3,536,600 1,716,400 1,163,600 569,100 7,988,300 1,754,200 1,529,600 3,283,800 11,272,100 December 31, 2005 Capitated HMO hospital system based 35,200     35,200 42,600  42,600 77,800 Capitated HMO physician group based 23,300    170,400 193,700 39,500  39,500 233,200 Risk-sharing 230,200    274,200 504,400 49,700  49,700 554,100 Other 269,100  1,750,900 1,138,200 13,300 3,171,500 1,868,000 1,171,000 3,039,000 6,210,500 Total 557,800  1,750,900 1,138,200 457,900 3,904,800 1,999,800 1,171,000 3,170,800 7,075,600 Medical Membership Distribution: December 31, 2006 Capitated HMO hospital system based 3.0 %     0.4 % 1.9 %  1.0 % 0.6 % Capitated HMO physician group based 2.4 %    26.1 % 2.2 % 1.7 %  0.9 % 1.8 % Risk-sharing 27.9 %    42.1 % 6.4 % 1.5 %  0.8 % 4.8 % All other membership 66.7 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 31.8 % 91.0 % 94.9 % 100.0 % 97.3 % 92.8 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % December 31, 2005 Capitated HMO hospital system based 6.3 %     0.9 % 2.1 %  1.3 % 1.1 % Capitated HMO physician group based 4.2 %    37.2 % 5.0 % 2.0 %  1.2 % 3.3 % Risk-sharing 41.3 %    59.9 % 12.9 % 2.5 %  1.6 % 7.8 % All other membership 48.2 %  100.0 % 100.0 % 2.9 % 81.2 % 93.4 % 100.0 % 95.9 % 87.8 % Total 100.0 %  100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Capitation expense as a percentage of total medical expense was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in thousands) Medical Expenses: Capitated HMO expense $ 382,584 2.2 % $ 456,123 3.9 % $ 465,231 4.4 % Other medical expense 17,038,620 97.8 % 11,195,347 96.1 % 10,204,416 95.6 % Consolidated medical expense $ 17,421,204 100.0 % $ 11,651,470 100.0 % $ 10,669,647 100.0 % 12 Table of Contents Accreditation Assessment Our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs, including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies, as well as external accreditation standards. We also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the Health Plan Employer Data Information Sets, or HEDIS, which is used by employers, government purchasers and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA, to evaluate HMOs based on various criteria, including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction. Physicians participating in our HMO networks must satisfy specific criteria, including licensing, patient access, office standards, after-hours coverage, and other factors. Most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by CMS and/or the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or JCAHO. Recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years, depending on applicable state laws. Recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses; review of their malpractice liability claims histories; review of their board certifications, if applicable; and review of applicable quality information. Committees, composed of a peer group of physicians, review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing. We request accreditation for certain of our HMO plans from NCQA and the American Accreditation Healthcare Commission/Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, or AAHC/URAC. Accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of Florida and Kansas for licensure as an HMO. Accreditation specific to the utilization review process also is required in the state of Georgia for licensure as an HMO or PPO. Certain commercial businesses, like those impacted by a third-party labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer, may require or prefer accredited health plans. NCQA performs reviews of standards for quality improvement, credentialing, utilization management, and member rights and responsibilities. We have achieved and maintained NCQA accreditation in all of our commercial HMO markets except Puerto Rico and in select PPO markets. AAHC/URAC performs reviews for utilization management standards and for health plan and health network standards in quality management, credentialing, rights and responsibilities, and network management. We continue to maintain URAC accreditation in select markets and certain operations. Humana has also pursued ISO 9001:2000 certification over the past several years. ISO is the international standards organization, which has developed an international commercial set of certifications as to quality and process, called ISO 9001:2000. Sales and Marketing We use various methods to market our Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial products, including television, radio, the Internet, telemarketing, and direct mailings. At December 31, 2006, we employed approximately 1,700 sales representatives, who are each paid a salary and per member commission to market our Medicare and Medicaid products in the United States and Puerto Rico. We employed approximately 600 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of Medicare and Medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members. We also market our Medicare products via a strategic alliance with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., or Wal-Mart. This alliance includes stationing Humana representatives in certain Wal-Mart stores, SAMS CLUB locations and Neighborhood Markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll Medicare eligible individuals in person. In addition, we market our Medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents including strategic alliances with State Farm® and USAA. We generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums, including bonuses based on sales volume. 13 Table of Contents Individuals become members of our commercial HMOs and PPOs through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products, pay for all or part of the premiums, and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees. We attempt to become an employers or groups exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of HMO, PPO, and specialty products that provide cost-effective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members. We also offer commercial health insurance products directly to individuals. At December 31, 2006, we used licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 700 licensed employees to sell our commercial products. Many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products. We generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums, with commissions varying by market and premium volume. In addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers, we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics. These include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products. We also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers. Risk Management Through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria, we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products. In most instances, employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage. Small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions. Underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our Medicare, TRICARE, or Medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history. Competition The health benefits industry is highly competitive. Our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies, national insurance companies, and other HMOs and PPOs, including HMOs and PPOs owned by Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. Many of our competitors have larger memberships and/or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete. Our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described on page 17 in Item 1A.Risk Factors. Government Regulation Federal regulation Government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The passing of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, represents the most sweeping changes to Medicare since the BBA. Changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. These regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results. Also, it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations. 14 Table of Contents State and local regulation We are also subject to substantial regulation by the states in which we do business. We regularly are audited and subject to various enforcement actions by state departments of insurance. These departments enforce laws relating to all aspects of our operations, including benefit offerings, marketing, claim payments, subsidiary capital requirements, and premium setting, especially with regard to our small group business. Although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, and other sanctions against us, including exclusion from participation in government programs, we do not believe the results of any of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Pending federal and state legislation Diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives continue at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nations health care system. Our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business. We are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted, what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed, when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a complete description of all of the current activities in the federal and state legislative areas, see Item 1A.Risk Factors on page 22. Other Captive Insurance Company We bear general business risks associated with operating our Company such as professional and general liability, employee workers compensation, and officer and director errors and omissions risks. Professional and general liability risks may include, for example, medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage. We retain certain of these risks through our wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary. We reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third-party insurance companies. We remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses. In an effort to minimize credit risk, we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings. Over the past few years, we have reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third-party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain based on the financial strength and liquidity of our captive insurance subsidiary. Centralized Management Services We provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and both of our business segments from our headquarters and service centers. These services include management information systems, product development and administration, finance, human resources, accounting, law, public relations, marketing, insurance, purchasing, risk management, internal audit, actuarial, underwriting, claims processing, and customer service. Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 22,300 employees, including 31 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This document includes both historical and forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, trends and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the information discussed below. In making these statements, we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results. Our business is highly complicated, regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results. If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate, our profitability could decline. We use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments, and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums. These factors may include:  increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs;  increased cost of such services;  our membership mix;  variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products, benefits or lines of business, product changes or benefit level changes;  membership in markets lacking adequate provider networks;  changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market;  termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee-for-service arrangements;  changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals;  possible changes in our pharmacy rebate program with drug manufacturers;  catastrophes, including acts of terrorism, public health epidemics, or severe weather (e.g. hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.);  the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies;  medical cost inflation; and  government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes. 16 Table of Contents Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could decline. We are in a highly competitive industry. Some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future, including emerging competitors in the Medicare program and in consumer-choice health plans, such as high deductible health plans with HSAs. We believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. Contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite being faced with increasing medical costs. The commercial pricing environment, particularly in the 2 to 300 member groups, is extremely competitive. We believe some of our competitors, including public and not-for-profit companies, are pricing aggressively to gain market share. Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationship with our providers in various markets, among other issues, could also affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into Medicare or Commercial markets, or the termination of a large contract, including our TRICARE contract. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, if membership does not increase as we expect, if membership declines, or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our Medicare initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our future performance depends in large part upon our management teams ability to execute our strategy to position the Company for the future. This strategy includes opportunities created by the MMA. The MMA offers new opportunities in our Medicare programs, including our HMO, PPO, and PFFS Medicare Advantage products, as well as our stand-alone PDP products. We have made substantial additional investments in the Medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these expanded programs. Over the last few years we have increased the size of our Medicare geographic reach since the enactment of the MMA through expanded Medicare product offerings. We are offering both the stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage and Medicare Advantage Health Plan with Prescription Drug Coverage in addition to our other product offerings. We have been approved to offer the Medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. The growth in our Medicare membership and revenues impacts the pattern of our quarterly earnings, including the timing of membership enrollment and the speed with which the individual members meet their deductibles and cost-sharing provisions. We have also made substantial investments in the service personnel and technology necessary to administer the growing Medicare business. We continue to work with CMS to devise solutions to certain CMS systems issues that have created some difficulty receiving correct information about eligibility of certain low income persons in the Part D program. 17 Table of Contents The growth of our Medicare business is an important part of our business strategy. Any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the expansion of our Medicare business in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in the Medicare business, which are described elsewhere in this document. These expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream. Additionally, our strategy includes the growth of our Commercial segment business, with emphasis on our ASO and individual products, introduction of new products and benefit designs, including our Smart, consumer-choice products such as HSAs as well as the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business. Our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of our past and on-going acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. We have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate, have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities, and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity, we could have operational disruptions, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory or other legal problems, have increases in operating expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers, or suffer other adverse consequences. We depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems-related support, equipment, facilities, and certain data, including data center operations, data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data processing. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors. A change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. We expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows. Our business plans also include becoming a quality e-business organization by enhancing interactions with customers, brokers, agents, and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology. Our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the Internet, and implementation of advanced self-service capabilities, for internal and external stakeholders. 18 Table of Contents There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our expanding operations, integrating new systems, protecting our proprietary information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows. We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. We are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, and tort claims. In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future:  claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums;  claims relating to the denial of health care benefit payments;  claims relating to the denial or rescission of insurance coverage;  challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims;  claims relating to our administration of our Medicare Part D offerings;  medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers alleged malpractice;  allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities;  provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts;  disputes related to ASO business, including actions alleging claim administration errors;  claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices;  claims relating to customer audits and contract performance; and  claims relating to dispensing of drugs associated with our in-house mail order pharmacy. In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other statutes may be sought. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. Additionally, the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly. As a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business. In addition, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance. In some jurisdictions, coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under Legal Proceedings in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 19 Table of Contents As a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs. A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, TRICARE, and Medicaid programs. Our Government segment accounted for approximately 70% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006 and we expect the Government segment to account for a greater percentage of our total premiums and ASO fees in 2007. These programs involve various risks, including:  at December 31, 2006, under our contracts with CMS we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 518,900 Medicare members in Florida. These contracts accounted for approximately 17% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006. The loss of these and other CMS contracts or significant changes in the Medicare program as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows;  at December 31, 2006, our TRICARE business, which accounted for approximately 12% of our total premiums and ASO fees during the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily consisted of the South Region contract. The 5-year South Region contract is subject to annual renewals on April 1 of each year at the governments option. Effective April 1, 2006, the South Region contract was extended into the third option period, which runs from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007 and covers 2.9 million beneficiaries. We have received a notice from the government of its intent to renew the fourth option period. The 5-year South Region contract expires March 31, 2009. As required under the contract, the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for the third option period were negotiated. Any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business. These changes may include, for example, an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal governments decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business;  at December 31, 2006, under our contracts with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 523,100 Medicaid members in Puerto Rico. These contracts accounted for approximately 2% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006. We currently are operating under the terms of our contracts that expired October 31, 2006. Due to several ongoing and unresolved issues with the program, the government of Puerto Rico has decided to delay the bid process for new contracts. We currently are working with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration regarding terms and rates which is expected to result in an extension of the existing contracts through September 30, 2007. There is no assurance that the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration will request such an extension, and we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that any government policy or fiscal decisions might have on the continuation of our Medicaid contracts in Puerto Rico. The loss of these contracts or significant changes in the Puerto Rico Medicaid program as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows;  the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal False Claims Act;  CMS has implemented a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare health plans according to health severity. A risk adjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably 20 Table of Contents higher costs. Under the risk adjustment methodology, all Medicare health plans must collect, capture and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to Medicare health plans. CMS has transitioned to the risk adjustment model for Medicare Advantage plans. In 2006, the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 75% from 50% in 2005. The phase-in of risk adjusted payment has increased to 100% in 2007;  commensurate with phase-in of the risk-adjustment methodology, payments to Medicare Advantage plans have been increased by a budget neutrality factor. The budget neutrality factor was implemented to prevent overall health plan payments from being reduced during the transition to the risk-adjustment payment model. The payment adjustments for budget neutrality were first developed in 2002 and began to be used with the 2003 payments. The budget neutrality adjustment will begin phasing out in 2007 and will be fully eliminated by 2011. This does not mean, however, that the aggregate per-member payments to Medicare plans will be reduced. As plans enroll less healthy beneficiaries, the need for the budget neutrality adjustment declines as the underlying risk adjusted Medicare rates paid to plans increase to account for their enrollees greater healthcare needs. As a result of the CMS payment methodology described previously, the amount and timing of our CMS monthly premium payments per member may change materially, either favorably or unfavorably;  Our CMS contracts which cover members prescription drugs under the Part D provisions of the MMA contain provisions for 1) risk sharing and 2) reimbursements of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk. The premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions, which is not expected to be applied against the rigors of a final settlement with CMS until mid-2007, requires us to consider factors that may not be certain. These factors include some first year implementation issues such as member eligibility differences with CMS, as well as interpretations of CMS operational guidance. Beginning in 2008, the risk corridor thresholds increase which means we will bear more risk. Our estimate of the settlement associated with the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions was a net liability of $738.7 million at December 31, 2006. Reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for CMSs portion of claims costs which exceed the members out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and settlement of CMSs prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 6 months after the close of each calendar year. This reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for CMS to administer the program. Our claims data may not pass CMSs claims edit processes due to various reasons, including but not limited to, discrepancies in eligibility or classification of low-income members. To the extent our data does not pass CMSs claim edit processes, we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or reimbursement as a low-income or 21 Table of Contents reinsurance claim. In addition, in the event the settlement represents an amount CMS owes us, there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing CMSs share of the risk. The opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe CMS;  future changes to these government programs which may affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs;  higher comparative medical costs;  government regulatory and reporting requirements; and  higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups. Our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability. The health care industry in general, and health insurance, particularly HMOs and PPOs are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation. Our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and Puerto Rico regulations. These regulations generally require, among other things, prior approval and/or notice of new products, rates, benefit changes, and certain material transactions, including dividend payments, purchases or sales of assets, intercompany agreements, and the filing of various financial and operational reports. Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $2,066.0 million in our state regulated subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $1,430.3 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Given our anticipated continued premium growth in 2007, capital requirements will increase. We expect to fund these increased requirements with capital contributions from Humana Inc., our parent company, in the range of $325 million to $425 million in 2007. Most states rely on risk-based capital requirements, or RBC, to define their required levels of equity discussed above. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to monitor an entitys solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. If RBC were adopted by the remaining states and Puerto Rico at December 31, 2006, each of our subsidiaries would be in substantial compliance and we would have $516.2 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under RBC, or individual state requirements. The use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA. HIPAA includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer, and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. 22 Table of Contents The rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent. These regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information. Violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties, including significant monetary penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. HIPAA could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. A business associate is a person or entity, other than a member of the work force, who on behalf of a covered entity performs or assists in the performance of a function or activity involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or provides legal, accounting, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, or financial services. Laws in each of the states (including Puerto Rico) in which we operate our HMOs, PPOs and other health insurance-related services regulate our operations, including the scope of benefits, rate formulas, delivery systems, utilization review procedures, quality assurance, complaint systems, enrollment requirements, claim payments, marketing, and advertising. The HMO, PPO, and other health insurance-related products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators. Our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and Puerto Rico regulations. We are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations. Under state laws, our HMOs and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance. Our HMOs are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health. Audits and investigations are also conducted by state attorneys general, CMS, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, and state Departments of Insurance and Departments of Health. Several state attorneys general and Departments of Insurance are currently investigating the practices of insurance brokers, including some of those used by certain companies in the health care industry. All of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs, or the imposition of fines, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. Other areas subject to substantial regulation include:  licensing requirements;  approval of policy language and benefits;  mandated benefits and processes;  approval of entry, withdrawal or re-entry into a state or market;  premium rates; and  periodic examinations by state and federal agencies. There are two areas of legislation that can impact the company that are experiencing an increase in legislative activity. These two areas are Medicare funding under MMA and proposals to expand health insurance coverage. MMA funding and associated program structure is an area of substantial legislative attention that may be influenced by federal budget considerations and Medicare spending trends. The second area of increased activity is federal and state efforts to expand access to health coverage. These proposals may offer opportunities to serve individuals who are not currently in the health insurance market through public program expansions, coverage connectors or premium assistance programs. Some access proposals also include increased regulation of our commercial business, particularly small group and individual, through a combination of benefit mandates, underwriting restrictions, rating limitations and assessments. 23 Table of Contents State and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to:  health insurance access and affordability;  e-connectivity;  universal health coverage;  disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data about payments to providers, sometimes called transparency;  disclosure of provider quality information; and  formation of regional/national association health plans for small employers. All of these proposals could apply to us and could result in new regulations that increase the cost of our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect entry into new markets, our revenues or the number of our members, increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted. Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability. The level of our administrative expenses impacts our profitability. While we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses, increases in staff-related expenses, investment in new products, including our opportunities in the Medicare programs, greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products, acquisitions, and implementation of regulatory requirements, among others, may occur from time to time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any failure by us to manage acquisitions, and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. Integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. These providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. 24 Table of Contents In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician specialty groups, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined, fixed, per-member-per-month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members. This type of contract is referred to as a capitation contract. The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Our recently implemented mail order pharmacy business subjects us to additional regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses. We have opened a mail order pharmacy business that subjects us to extensive federal, state and local regulation. We are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products, and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mail-services pharmacies. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pharmacy subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties. Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., our parent company. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by states Departments of Insurance. We are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. In addition, we normally notify the state Departments of Insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. In the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., our operations or financial position may be adversely affected. Downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the rating 25 Table of Contents agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders, but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such. Downgrades in our ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business. The health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ITEM 1B.
