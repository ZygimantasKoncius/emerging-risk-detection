Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below. You should carefully consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity. This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials we file with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks may also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity. Such risks could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those referred to or implied in any forward looking statements. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable general economic developments, as well as by specific related factors such as the performance of the debt and equity markets and changes in interest rates. Economic and market conditions materially and adversely affected us in the last recession. The economy may once again deteriorate. The resulting lack of credit, lack of confidence in the financial sector, volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The availability of credit, consumer spending, business investment, capital market conditions and inflation affect our business. In an economic downturn, higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending may depress the demand for life insurance, annuities and investment products. In addition, this type of economic environment may result in higher lapses or surrenders of life and annuity policies we provide. Accordingly, the risks we face related to general economic and business conditions are pronounced. More specifically, our business is exposed to the performance of the debt and equity markets. These adverse conditions include, but are not limited to, a lack of buyers for certain assets, volatility, credit spread changes and benchmark interest rate changes. Each of these factors may impact the liquidity and value of our investments. These effects include, but are not limited to, the following: · Our investments in alternative asset classes, such as private equity funds, mezzanine funds, hedge funds and limited partnership interests generate returns that are more volatile than other asset classes, are also relatively illiquid and may be harder to value or sell in adverse market conditions. · Poor performance of the debt and equity markets diminishes our fee revenues by reducing the value of the assets we manage within our variable annuity and variable life products. · Significant accounting estimates may be materially affected by the equity and debt markets and their impact on our customers’ behavior. For example, in setting amortization schedules for our deferred policy acquisition costs, we make assumptions about future market performance and policyholder behavior. Also, we analyze our ability to utilize deferred tax assets based on projected financial results which reflect the impact of financial markets on our business. · The funding requirements of our pension plan are dependent on the performance of the debt and equity markets. We made contributions of $25.7 million to the pension plans during 2010. During 2011, we expect to make contributions of approximately $16.4 million to these plans, of which approximately $3.5 million will be made in the first quarter of 2011. Future market declines could result in additional funding requirements. Also, the funding requirements of our pension plan are sensitive to interest rate changes. Should interest rates decrease materially, the value of the liabilities under the plan would increase, as would the requirement for future funding. 8 · The value of our investment portfolio can be depressed by general interest rate increases or credit spread widening, as well as by illiquidity and by changes in assumptions or inputs we use in estimating fair value of the portfolio. In addition, issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. These factors may result in significant realized and unrealized losses. · Certain types of securities in our investment portfolio, such as those supported by residential and commercial mortgages, could experience further realized and/or unrealized losses if the delinquency rates of the underlying mortgage loans increase. Interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Changes in interest rates also have other effects related to our investment portfolio. In periods of increasing interest rates, life insurance policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals could increase as policyholders seek investments with higher returns. This could require us to sell invested assets at a time when their prices are depressed by the increase in interest rates, which could cause us to realize investment losses. Conversely, during periods of declining interest rates, we could experience increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased percentages of policies remaining in force. We would obtain lower returns on investments made with these cash flows. In addition, borrowers may prepay or redeem bonds in our investment portfolio so that we might have to reinvest those proceeds in lower yielding investments. As a consequence of these factors, we could experience a decrease in the spread between the returns on our investment portfolio and amounts credited to policyholders and contract owners, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital. Adverse capital and credit market conditions may limit our access to liquidity and affect the availability and cost of borrowed funds. We need liquidity to meet policyholder obligations and to pay operating expenses and interest on our debt, as well as any shareholder dividends declared by our Board of Directors. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated by operations and investment activities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail certain of our operations, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Additional actions could include, but are not limited to: · Accessing external sources of capital, including the debt or equity markets; · Limiting or curtailing sales of certain products and/or restructuring existing products; · Undertaking asset sales; and · Seeking temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules. Certain of these actions could require regulatory approval. Our principal sources of liquidity are insurance premiums, annuity considerations, deposit funds and cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets, to the extent they consist of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. In addition, we may seek access to external sources of liquidity, including the potential issuance of debt and equity securities. The availability of these sources depends on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. The deterioration of our credit ratings has reduced our ability to obtain new financing in support of our business on favorable terms and eliminated altogether our ability to access certain markets. 9 Guaranteed benefits within our products that protect policyholders against significant downturns in equity markets may decrease our earnings, increase the volatility of our results if hedging strategies prove ineffective, result in higher hedging costs and expose us to increased counterparty risk, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Certain of our products include guaranteed benefits. These include GMDBs, GMABs, GMWBs and guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIBs). Periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefit associated with such products, resulting in a reduction to earnings. We use derivative instruments to hedge the liability exposure and the volatility of earnings associated with some of these liabilities, and even when these and other actions would otherwise successfully mitigate the risks related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. In addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, including lower withdrawals or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. Hedging instruments we hold to manage product and other risks have not, and may continue to not, perform as intended or expected, resulting in higher realized losses. Market conditions can also result in losses on product related hedges and such losses may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. Hedging gains were $2.4 million in 2010 and hedging losses were $4.2 million in 2009. These factors, individually or collectively, may adversely affect our profitability, financial condition or liquidity. Our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses. Our policies and procedures to monitor and manage risks, including hedging programs that utilize derivative financial instruments, may not be fully effective and may leave us exposed to unidentified and unanticipated risks. The Company uses models in its hedging programs and many other aspects of its operations, including but not limited to the estimation of actuarial reserves, the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the value of business acquired, and the valuation of certain other assets and liabilities. These models rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Past or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. A failure of our computer systems or a compromise of their security could also subject us to regulatory sanctions or other claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. The amount of statutory capital that we have and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to meet rating agency and other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including equity market and credit market conditions and changes in rating agency models. We conduct the majority of our business through our insurance company subsidiaries. Accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC has established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital (RBC) formulas for our insurance company subsidiaries. The RBC formula for our insurance company subsidiaries establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. 10 In any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors: the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the RBC formulas. Most of these factors are outside of our control. Our financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital they believe we should hold. Further, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines, such as those experienced recently, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees may increase dramatically. This reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our RBC ratios. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to implement a new business plan. We are implementing a new business plan that leverages existing product manufacturing strengths and partnering capabilities to focus new business development in areas that are less capital intensive and appeal to distributors including those with middle market clients. This plan calls for distributing other companies products through our newly formed distribution company and selling our products through new distribution channels including IMOs. We have limited experience in the middle market and are subject to risks such as product suitability and pricing. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we began to see a significant volume of sales of fixed indexed annuities. This is a relatively new product for us and we may be subject to additional operational and hedging risks. This new business plan may not succeed and may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers. If our reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We establish and carry reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. Our reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial or statistical estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment, including as to the levels of and/or timing of receipt or payment of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), retirement, mortality, morbidity and persistency. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits, claims and expenses or whether the assets supporting our policy liabilities, together with future premiums, will be sufficient for payment of benefits and claims. If we conclude that our reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover future policy benefits and claims, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. It is difficult to value certain illiquid securities in our investment portfolio because of infrequent trading and/or lack of observable market data. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods which are more complex. These values may not be ultimately realizable in a market transaction, and such values may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Changes in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The decision on whether to record other-than-temporary impairments (OTTIs) or write-downs is determined in part by our assessment of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability of the particular security as well as managements assertion of our intention to sell the security, and if it is more likely than not that we will sell the securities before recovery. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Estimates for further information regarding our impairment decision-making process. Managements determination of whether a decline in value is other than temporary includes our analysis of the underlying credit and our intention and ability not to have to sell the security, versus the extent and duration of a decline in value. Our conclusions on such assessments may ultimately prove to be incorrect as facts and circumstances change. 11 Downgrades of debt and financial strength ratings could increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, adversely affect relationships with distributors, reduce new sales and increase our future borrowing costs. Rating agencies assign Phoenix Life and its subsidiaries financial strength ratings, and assign us debt ratings, based in each case on their opinions of the Companys or Phoenix Lifes ability to meet their respective financial obligations. Our ratings relative to other companies in the industry affect our competitive position. Downgrades since 2008 have adversely affected our reputation and, hence, our ability to distribute our products through unaffiliated third parties. These downgrades in ratings have materially and adversely affected new sales of our products and the persistency of existing customers, as well as our ability to borrow. At this time, we cannot estimate the impact of specific future rating agency actions on sales or persistency. Any rating downgrades may also result in a lack of access to or increased interest costs in connection with future borrowings. Such an increase would decrease our earnings and could reduce our ability to finance our future growth and may require us to reduce our operations. We have been downgraded and continue to have a negative outlook with one of the three rating agencies. · On February 8, 2011, A.M. Best Company, Inc. affirmed our financial strength rating of B+ and our senior debt rating of bb-. They changed their outlook on all ratings from negative to stable. · On June 17, 2010, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded our financial strength rating from Ba1 to Ba2 and lowered our senior debt rating from B1 to B3. They changed their outlook on all ratings from negative to stable. · On February 12, 2010, Standard & Poor’s downgraded our financial strength rating from BB to BB- and lowered our senior debt rating from B- to CCC+. They maintained their negative outlook on all ratings. In light of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions, including insurance companies, rating agencies have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews and requested additional information from the companies that they rate, including us. They may also adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response. Accordingly, further downgrades may occur in the future at any time and without notice by any rating agency. Our results may be negatively impacted if investment returns, mortality rates, persistency rates, funding levels, expenses or other factors differ significantly from our assumptions used in pricing products. We set prices for many of our insurance and annuity products based upon expected investment returns, claims, expected persistency of these policies and the expected level and pattern of premium payments into these policies. We use assumptions for equity market returns, investment portfolio yields, and mortality rates, or likelihood of death, of our policyholders in pricing our products. Pricing also incorporates the expected persistency of these products, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next, as well as the assumed level and pattern of premium payments and the cost we incur to acquire and administer policies. Recent trends in the life insurance industry may affect our mortality, persistency and funding levels. The evolution of the financial needs of policyholders and the emergence of a secondary market for life insurance and increased availability of premium financing suggest that the reasons for purchasing our products are changing. At the same time, we also experienced an increase in life insurance sales to older individuals. While we instituted certain controls and procedures to screen applicants, we believe that our sales of universal life products include sales of policies to third party investors who, at the time of policy origination, had no insurable interest in the insured. The effect that these changes may have on our actual experience and profitability will emerge over time. Deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the profitability of certain universal life products. Most of our current products permit us to increase charges and adjust crediting rates during the life of the policy or contract (subject to guarantees in the policies and contracts). We implemented an increase in the cost of insurance rates for certain universal life policies effective April 1, 2010. However, this adjustment and any other permitted adjustments may not be sufficient to maintain profitability. In addition, increasing charges on in force policies or contracts may adversely affect our relationships with distributors, future sales and surrenders and may result in claims against us by policyholders. Furthermore, some of our in force business consists of products that do not permit us to adjust the charges and credited rates of in force policies or contracts. 12 Deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could also cause us to increase the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal business. Costs that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of new and renewal business are deferred and amortized over time. The recovery of deferred policy acquisition costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Estimates. The amount of future profit or margin is dependent on investment returns, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin, mortality, premium persistency, funding patterns and expenses. These factors enter into managements estimates of gross profits or margins, which generally are used to amortize such costs. If the estimates of gross profits or margins cannot support the continued amortization or recovery of deferred policy acquisition costs, as was the case in 2010, the amortization of such costs is accelerated in the period in which the assumptions are changed, resulting in a charge to income. For example, in 2010 we had an unlocking of deferred policy acquisition costs of $46.4 million. Such adjustments may in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We may incur losses if our reinsurers are unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts. The availability, pricing and terms of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. We utilize reinsurance to reduce the severity and incidence of claims costs, and to provide relief with regard to certain reserves. As of December 31, 2010, 65.1% of the total face amount of our written policies was ceded to reinsurers. Under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Consequently, reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims and we assume credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from our reinsurers. Although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers, the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain available to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as have been historically available. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. Any of these alternatives may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. We might be unable to attract or retain personnel who are key to our business. The success of our business is dependent to a large extent on our ability to attract and retain key employees. Competition in the job market for senior executives and professionals such as securities analysts, portfolio managers, sales personnel, technology professionals and actuaries can be intense. In general, our employees are not subject to employment contracts or non-compete agreements. In 2009 and 2010, to reduce and control our expenditures, we implemented a series of actions, including the freezing of senior management salaries and our qualified and non-qualified pension plans, that could impact our relationship with our senior management and our ability to retain or attract senior executives, key employees or professionals we need to operate our business successfully. These actions and further actions that may be implemented could have a negative impact on us. Our business operations and results could be adversely affected by inadequate performance of third-party relationships. We are dependent on certain third-party relationships to maintain essential business operations. These services include, but are not limited to, information technology infrastructure, application systems support, transfer agent and cash management services, custodial services, records storage management, backup tape management, security pricing services, medical information, payroll, and employee benefit programs. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to such third parties or us. An interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties or any material delay or inability to deliver essential services could materially affect our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations. 13 We face strong competition in our businesses from insurance companies and other financial services firms. This competition could impair our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our results of operations. We face strong competition in our businesses. We believe that our ability to compete is based on a number of factors, including product features, investment performance, service, price, distribution capabilities, scale, commission structure, name recognition, reputation and financial strength ratings. While there is no single company that we identify as a dominant competitor in our business overall, our actual and potential competitors include a large number of insurance companies and other financial services firms, many of which have advantages over us in one or more of the above competitive factors. Larger competitors with better financial strength ratings, greater financial resources, marketing and distribution capabilities are better positioned competitively. Larger firms are able better withstand further market disruption, able to offer more competitive pricing, and have superior access to debt and equity capital. If we fail to compete effectively in this environment, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Because we are a holding company with no direct operations, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations and pay future dividends. We are a holding company, and we have no direct operations. Our principal asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. When economic or market conditions deteriorate, as they have recently, the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds may be impaired. This is especially true of our insurance company subsidiaries. Payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our insurance company subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. For example, the ability of Phoenix Life to pay dividends to the Company without special regulatory approval is $64.8 million for 2011. Changes to these laws, or the application or implementation of those laws by any of the regulatory agencies, especially those of New York State, the domiciliary state of Phoenix Life, could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. We might need to fund deficiencies in our closed block, which would adversely impact results of operations and could also result in a reduction in investments in our on-going business. We have allocated assets to our closed block to produce cash flows that, together with additional revenues from the closed block policies, are reasonably expected to support our obligations relating to these policies. Our allocation of assets to the closed block was based on actuarial assumptions about the performance of policies in the closed block and the continuation of the non-guaranteed policyholder dividend scales in effect for 2000, as well as assumptions about the investment earnings the closed block assets will generate over time. Since actual performance is likely to be different from these assumptions, it is possible that the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block will prove insufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies even if the non-guaranteed policyholder dividend scale were to be reduced. If this were to occur, we would have to fund the resulting shortfall from assets outside of the closed block, which could adversely affect our results of operations and reduce our ability to invest in other on-going businesses. Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products and increase our tax costs. Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products we offer, primarily life insurance and annuities, receive favorable tax treatment. This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. In addition, a substantial proportion of our in-force policies were originally sold for estate and business planning, including tax planning. Congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. While there are no legislative proposals that would adversely impact existing policies, there are provisions included in the current administrations proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2012 (the Administrations Proposed Federal Budget) that could adversely impact life insurance products as well as the computation of life insurance company taxation. In addition to new proposals, a recent change in the estate tax also impacts the need for life insurance products in certain circumstances. 14 The Administrations Proposed Federal Budget includes substantial changes in the computation of the dividends received deduction (DRD) relative to bothh general account and separate account dividends. If enacted, they could increase our actual tax expense and reduce our consolidated net income. Congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning. We also benefit from certain tax benefits, including but not limited to, deductibility of performance-based compensation that exceeds $1.0 million, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends-received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. Congress, as well as foreign, state and local governments, also considers from time to time legislation that could modify or eliminate these benefits, thereby increasing our tax costs. If such legislation were to be adopted, our consolidated results of operations could be adversely impacted. Potential changes in federal and state regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. We are subject to extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. This is particularly the case given recent adverse economic and market developments. These laws and regulations are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities including foreign regulators, state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys general. In light of recent events involving certain financial institutions and the current financial crisis, it is likely that the U.S. government will heighten its oversight of the financial services industry, including possibly through a federal system of insurance regulation. In addition, it is possible that these authorities may adopt enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises in the financial services industry and to assure the stability of institutions under their supervision. We cannot predict whether this or other regulatory proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such regulation could have on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. Each of the authorities that regulate us exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), which implements significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape and will impact institutions operating in many segments of the financial services industry, including the Company. Although certain provisions became effective immediately, many of the Acts provisions require adoption of rules that will govern implementation. The Act may, among other things, increase our regulatory compliance burden by requiring us to invest management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our policies and procedures and the manner in which we conduct our business. We are uncertain as to the impact that this new legislation and regulatory guidance will have on the Company and cannot assure that it will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 15 State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: · licensing companies and agents to transact business; · calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; · mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; · regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; · establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; · fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; · approving changes in control of insurance companies; · restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and · regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. Changes in all of these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Compliance with these laws and regulations is also time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business, thus having an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Regulatory actions could result in financial losses or harm to our businesses. Various regulatory bodies regularly make inquiries of us and, from time to time, conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws, and laws governing the activities of broker-dealers. During the past several years, there has been a significant increase in federal and state regulatory activity relating to financial services companies, with a number of recent regulatory inquiries focusing on late-trading, market timing and valuation issues. Financial services companies have also been the subject of broad industry inquiries by state regulators and attorneys general which do not appear to be company-specific. We have had inquiries relating to market timing and distribution practices in the past, and we continue to cooperate with the applicable regulatory authorities in these matters. While the regulatory authorities have not taken action against us with regard to these inquiries, we may be subject to further related or unrelated inquiries or actions in the future. In light of recent events involving certain financial institutions, it is possible that the U.S. government will heighten its oversight of the financial services industry in general or of the insurance industry in particular. Further, recent adverse economic and market events may have the effect of encouraging litigation, arbitration and regulatory action in response to the increased frequency and magnitude of investment losses, which may result in unfavorable judgments, awards and settlements, regulatory fines and an increase in our related legal expenses. It is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all regulatory proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. We believe that the outcomes of regulatory matters are not likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. However, given the inherent unpredictability of regulatory matters, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Legal actions are inherent in our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position or harm our businesses or reputation. We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal actions in the ordinary course of our businesses. Some of these proceedings have been brought, and may be brought in the future, on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could have an adverse affect on us or cause us reputational harm, which in turn could harm our business prospects or result in regulatory or legislative responses. 16 Our litigation matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Companys litigation matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position. We could have material losses in the future from our discontinued reinsurance business. In 1999, we discontinued our reinsurance operations through a combination of sale, reinsurance and placement of certain retained group accident and health reinsurance business into run-off. We adopted a formal plan to stop writing new contracts covering these risks and to end the existing contracts as soon as those contracts would permit. However, we remain liable for claims under contracts which have not been commuted. We have established reserves for claims and related expenses that we expect to pay on our discontinued group accident and health reinsurance business. These reserves are based on currently known facts and estimates about, among other things, the amount of insured losses and expenses that we believe we will pay, the period over which they will be paid, the amount of reinsurance we believe we will collect from our retrocessionaires and the likely legal and administrative costs of winding down the business. Our total policy liabilities and accruals were $49.7 million and $69.8 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our total amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires related to paid losses were $9.1 million and $1.8 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect our reserves and reinsurance to cover the run-off of the business; however, the nature of the underlying risks is such that the claims may take years to reach the reinsurers involved. Therefore, we expect to pay claims out of existing estimated reserves as the level of business diminishes. In addition, unfavorable or favorable claims and/or reinsurance recovery experience is reasonably possible and could result in our recognition of additional losses or gains, respectively, in future years. For these reasons, we cannot know today what our actual claims experience will be. In addition, we are involved in disputes relating to certain portions of our discontinued group accident and health reinsurance business. See Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. In establishing our reserves described above for the payment of insured losses and expenses on this discontinued business, we have made assumptions about the likely outcome of the disputes referred to above, including an assumption that substantial recoveries would be available from our reinsurers on all of our discontinued reinsurance business. However, the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it hard to predict outcomes with certainty. Given the need to use estimates in establishing loss reserves, and the difficulty in predicting the outcome of arbitrations and lawsuits, our actual net ultimate exposure likely will differ from our current estimate. If future facts and circumstances differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions about future events with respect to the disputes referred to above or other portions of our discontinued reinsurance business, our current reserves may need to be increased materially, with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. It is possible that these and other future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could significantly affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataAdoption of New Accounting Standards in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 17 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to remediate this weakness, we may not be able to ensure that our financial statements are free from material misstatements. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting designed to ensure proper accounting for deferred income taxes. The Companys review procedures failed to identify an error in the assumptions used in the model that assesses the level of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. As a result, the Company recorded adjustments to its deferred tax asset and other comprehensive income for the periods ended June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010. As a result of this material weakness, management determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2010. The material weakness is described in Item 9A entitled CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although this error did not result in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, the material weakness, or difficulties encountered in implementing new or improved controls or remediation, could prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results, result in material misstatements in our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
