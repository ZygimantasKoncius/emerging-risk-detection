ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this annual report. If any of the risks discussed in this annual report actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the price of our common shares could decline significantly and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Primary Insurance and Reinsurance Business Segments Our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our losses. We establish loss reserves in our financial statements that represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured and reinsured events that have occurred, including events that have not yet been reported to us. Loss reserves are estimates and are inherently uncertain; they do not and cannot represent an exact measure of liability. Workers compensation claims are often paid over a long period of time. There are no policy limits on liability for primary workers compensation claims, as there are for other types of insurance. Estimating reserves for insurance and reinsurance of workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other lines of insurance or reinsurance with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and 30 Table of Contents final determination of the ultimate loss and with policy limits for claim amounts. Accordingly, there is a greater risk that we may fail to accurately estimate the risks associated with the businesses that we insure and that our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses. Further, this risk is greater for reinsurance than for primary insurance of workers compensation claims because the period of time that generally elapses between the underwriting and pricing of our reinsurance contracts and the payment of a claim pursuant to such reinsurance is even longer than that for primary insurance coverage and, as a result, our reserves are more difficult to estimate and are even less likely to be accurate. Loss reserve estimates are based on estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims and on actuarial estimation techniques. Several factors contribute to the uncertainty in establishing these estimates. Judgment is required in actuarial estimation to ascertain the relevance of historical payment and claim settlement patterns under current facts and circumstances. Key assumptions in the estimation of claims over time include the increasing level of medical, legal and rehabilitation costs, frequency risks, fluctuations in inflation, prevailing economic, social and judicial trends, legislative changes, third party claims handling procedures and costs associated with fraud or other abuses of the medical claim process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves, it has been, and will continue to be, necessary to revise estimated future liabilities as reflected in our reserves for claims and related expenses. In states other than California, Majestic has a shorter operating history. Consequently, we must rely on a combination of industry benchmarks, our limited experience in these states and our experience in California. Operational changes in claims handling practices over the years may impact the interpretation of this historical data, which can also be impacted by external forces such as legislative changes, economic fluctuations and legal trends. A key assumption in the estimation process for workers compensation reserves is severity trends, including the increasing costs of health care and the medical claims process. If there were unfavorable changes in severity trends, our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses might need to be increased, which would result in a charge to our earnings. Since Twin Bridges has only been in existence since December 2003 and has had limited loss experience and a relatively small population of underlying risks, we rely heavily on industry data in establishing our loss reserves. Our own experience in this line of business could run materially higher than industry loss experience and therefore we are exposed to an increased likelihood that our actual results may not conform to our estimates. To the extent our loss reserves for Majestic or Twin Bridges are insufficient to cover actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, we will have to adjust our loss reserves and may incur charges to our earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Twin Bridges, our reinsurance subsidiary, reinsures some of the primary business of our Majestic subsidiary. Consequently, we are exposed to a greater share of certain losses, since, on a consolidated basis, we are providing as much as $2 million of net coverage for some risks. Any underestimate of our loss reserves for this risk would have a greater impact on our results of operations and financial position. The increased overall exposure to losses from large and/or frequent loss occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we do not effectively price our insurance policies, our financial results will be adversely affected. Our primary insurance policy prices are established when coverage is initiated. Adequate rates are necessary to generate premiums sufficient to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. Our prices for primary insurance coverage are based on estimates of expected losses generated from the policies which we underwrite. We analyze many factors when pricing a policy, including the policyholders prior loss history, and the loss prevention orientation of the policyholders management. Inaccurate information regarding a policyholders past claims experience puts us at risk of mispricing our policies. When initiating coverage on a policyholder, we rely on the claims information provided by the policyholder or previous carriers to properly estimate future claims expense. If the claims information is not accurately stated, we may under price our policy by using claims estimates that are too low. As a result, our actual costs for providing insurance coverage to our policyholders may be significantly higher than our premiums, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Besides the risks associated with under pricing risks, we 31 Table of Contents could overprice risks, which could reduce our sales volume and competitiveness. In addition, our competitors may adopt premium rate reductions that are greater than ours. In any of these scenarios, our business, financial conditions, and results of operations could be materially affected. Finally, the rating actions of state regulatory authorities have a material impact on the pricing of our policies. For a discussion of such actions, see Drivers of Profitability in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report. A downgrade in the A.M. Best ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could reduce the amount of business we are able to write. Third-party rating agencies assess and rate the claims-paying ability of insurers based upon criteria established by the agencies. Both Majestic and Twin Bridges currently have a financial strength rating of A− (Excellent) from A.M. Best. These financial strength ratings are used by policyholders, insurers, reinsurers and insurance and reinsurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of our insurance subsidiaries. These ratings are not evaluations directed to potential purchasers of our common stock and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our common stock. We believe that the ratings assigned by A.M. Best are an important factor in marketing our products. For example, some of our independent agents and brokers and insureds have guidelines governing the financial strength rating of the company providing coverage. A reduction of our A.M. Best rating below A− would prevent us from issuing policies to such entities. Our ratings are subject to change at any time and could be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agencies. Our ability to retain our existing business and to attract new business in our insurance operations depends largely on these ratings. Our failure to maintain our ratings, or any other adverse development with respect to our ratings, could cause our current and future independent agents and brokers, insureds, self-insured groups and their individual members to choose to transact their business with more highly rated competitors. If A.M. Best downgrades our ratings or publicly indicates that our ratings are under review, it is likely that we would not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and our ability to sell our products could decline. If that happens, our revenues and earnings could decrease substantially. In addition, because lenders and reinsurers will also use our A.M. Best ratings as a factor in deciding whether to transact business with us, the failure of Majestic or Twin Bridges to maintain their current ratings could dissuade a lender or reinsurance company from conducting business with us or might increase our interest or reinsurance costs. If we are unable to obtain or collect on our reinsurance protection, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We purchase reinsurance coverage to help manage the risk assumed under our workers insurance compensation policies issued by Majestic. Reinsurance coverage helps to protect us from the impact of large losses. It involves an arrangement in which an insurance company, called the ceding company, transfers insurance risk by sharing premiums with another insurance company, called the reinsurer. Conversely, the reinsurer receives or assumes reinsurance from the ceding company. Majestic currently purchases excess of loss reinsurance. Under excess of loss reinsurance, the reinsurer reimburses the ceding company for losses and loss expenses over a specified dollar amount up to an agreed limit per occurrence. Majestics excess of loss coverage provides reinsurance for occurrences of loss that exceed $500 thousand but are less than $100.0 million. For a detailed discussion of Majestics reinsurance program, see Primary Insurance Segment Reinsurance in Item 1 above. The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and our experience with insured losses and may vary significantly. As a result of catastrophic events, such as the events of September 11, 2001, we may incur significantly higher reinsurance costs, more restrictive terms and conditions, and decreased availability. We review and renegotiate our reinsurance protection each year. We cannot be certain, however, that our reinsurance agreements will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration upon terms satisfactory to us. If we are unable to renew or replace our reinsurance agreements upon terms satisfactory to us, our net liability on individual risks would increase and we would have greater exposure to catastrophic losses. If this were to occur, our underwriting results would be subject to greater variability and our underwriting capacity could be reduced. These consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 32 Table of Contents Although we currently expect to renew Majestics current excess of loss treaty reinsurance program upon its expiration, any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance at the time of renewal, whether caused by the existence of more restrictive terms and conditions or decreased availability, will also increase our risk of loss and, as a result, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Majestic currently has 22 reinsurers participating in its excess of loss reinsurance program, and we believe that this is a sufficient number of reinsurers to provide us with reinsurance in the volume that we require. We are also subject to credit risk with respect to Majestics reinsurers. Reinsurance protection that Majestic receives does not discharge its direct obligations under its insurance policies. Majestic remains liable to its policyholders, even if we are unable to make recoveries to which we believe we are entitled under Majestics reinsurance contracts. Losses may not be recovered from the reinsurers until claims are paid, and, in the case of long-term workers compensation cases, the creditworthiness of the reinsurers may change and we may not recover amounts to which we are entitled. If we experience these problems in the future, our charges to income would increase and our revenues would decline. As of December 31, 2007, Majestic had $42.7 million of amounts recoverable from its reinsurers that we would be obligated to pay if the reinsurers failed to pay Majestic. These consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to realize our investment objectives, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Investment income is an important component of our net income. As of December 31, 2007, our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, had a carrying value of $301.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we had $11.4 million of net investment income. Our investment portfolios are managed under investment guidelines approved by our Board of Directors. Although these guidelines stress diversification and capital preservation, our investments are subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to general economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations and market volatility. General economic conditions may be adversely affected by U.S. involvement in hostilities with other countries and large-scale acts of terrorism, or the threat of hostilities or terrorist acts. Our investment portfolios include a significant amount of interest rate-sensitive instruments, such as bonds, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Increases in interest rates will decrease the value of our investments in fixed-income securities. If increases in interest rates occur during periods when we sell investments to satisfy liquidity needs, we may experience investment losses. Conversely, if interest rates decline, reinvested funds will earn less than expected. Any significant decline in our investment income as a result of falling interest rates, decreased dividend payment rates or general market conditions could have an adverse effect on our net income and, as a result, on our shareholders equity and our policyholders surplus. Our profitability may be adversely impacted by inflation. The effects of inflation could cause the amount of each claim to rise in the future. Our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses include assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling costs, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. To the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these costs, we would be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds, second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability. Most states require insurance companies licensed to do business in their state to participate in guaranty funds, which require the insurance companies to bear a portion of the unfunded obligations of impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies. These obligations are funded by assessments, which are expected to continue in the future. 33 Table of Contents State guaranty associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurance companies in the state based on their proportionate share of premiums written in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies are engaged. Accordingly, the assessments levied on us may increase as we increase our written premium. Some states also have laws that establish second injury funds to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries. These funds are supported by either assessments or premium surcharges based on case incurred losses. In addition, as a condition to conducting business in some states, insurance companies are required to participate in residual market programs to provide insurance to those employers who cannot procure coverage from an insurance carrier on a negotiated basis. Insurance companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by, among other things, participating in a reinsurance pool where the results of all policies provided through the pool are shared by the participating insurance companies. Although we price our insurance to account for obligations we may have under these pooling arrangements, we may not be successful in estimating our liability for these obligations. Accordingly, mandatory pooling arrangements may cause a decrease in our profits. As we write policies in new states that have mandatory pooling arrangements, we will be required to participate in pooling arrangements. Further, the impairment, insolvency or failure of other insurance companies in these pooling arrangements would likely increase the liability for other members in the pool. The effect of assessments and premium surcharges or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business. We may have exposure to losses from terrorism for which we are required by law to provide coverage. When writing workers compensation insurance policies, we are required by law to provide workers compensation benefits for losses arising from acts of terrorism. The impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable, and the ultimate impact on us would depend upon the nature, extent, location and timing of such an act. Majestics current excess of loss reinsurance treaty program excludes coverage for acts of terrorism. Notwithstanding the protection provided by reinsurance and the Terrorism Risk Act, the risk of severe losses to us from acts of terrorism has not been eliminated. Accordingly, events constituting acts of terrorism may not be covered by, or may exceed the capacity of Terrorism Risk Act and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Our reinsurance business is heavily dependent on Majestic, our primary insurance subsidiary, and the self-insured groups we manage. We could be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain or increase this business. Twin Bridges, our reinsurance subsidiary, derives its revenues primarily from reinsurance of risk assumed by Majestic, our primary insurance company. Twin Bridges provides excess of loss reinsurance protection to Majestic on a portion of the risk it assumes under its primary insurance policies. Twin Bridges also provides quota share protection to Majestic on a portion of the risk it assumes under the excess coverage purchased by our self-insured groups. Our groups may determine to obtain excess coverage insurance from other U.S. admitted insurers if such insurers offer a better rate or more favorable terms than those offered by us through Majestic. These insurers in turn may not offer Twin Bridges the opportunity to reinsure a portion of the excess coverage or may only do so in lower amounts or on terms and conditions that are less favorable or not acceptable to us. This may occur if these insurers are offered a better rate or more favorable terms from other reinsurers. Our reinsurance business is also dependent upon our relationship with the self-insured groups we manage, and consequently, our reinsurance business may be adversely affected if the self-insured groups we manage decline in premium volume or cease active business operations. Consequently, unless we diversify our reinsurance business, our reinsurance segment will remain heavily dependent on our primary insurance segment. Majestic could lose or otherwise have its current licenses revoked or fail to maintain satisfactory ratings from relevant rating agencies, thereby negatively impacting our business operations. In turn, we could lose all or a substantial portion of our reinsurance premium revenues. Any of the adverse developments described above would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 34 Table of Contents We may pursue opportunities to offer other insurance products, and any failure to manage the risks involved could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may explore the development and offering of certain non-workers compensation property and casualty insurance products. A number of risks are inherent in this strategy, including, among others the need to obtain required licenses to issue non-workers compensation property and casualty products and additional regulatory approvals, along with the potential for a greater loss exposure, especially if we fail to successfully manage or underwrite the new products. If we are unable to effectively manage these or other potential risks inherent in the marketing and sale of additional insurance products, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Fee-Based Segment Due to the joint and several liability of New York and California self-insured groups, the failure of any self-insured group in the state of New York or California could adversely affect our fee-based business. Each member of a self-insured group has joint and several liability for the obligations of the group incurred during the period of its membership and that group may assess the members for any short-fall, even after a member leaves a group, if the loss was incurred during such members participation in the group. If a group is not able to pay its liabilities from its assets or these assessments, the New York Workers Compensation Board may use the security posted by the group and can also assess all of the other groups in New York State to pay these liabilities. In California, each member of a self-insured group must participate as a member in the Self-Insurers Security Fund established by state law. Such fund may assess each of its members a pro rata share of the funding necessary as a result of the failure of a private self-insured employer or self-insured group to meet its compensation obligations when the employers or groups security deposit is either inadequate or not immediately accessible for the payment of benefits. The failure of a single large self-insured group in New York or California, even if it is a group that we do not manage, could have an adverse effect on the other groups in the state and could affect the regulation of groups by the state. Any such developments may seriously hamper our ability to retain existing members and attract new members to our managed groups, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations. If the loss reserves for the self-insured groups we manage are underestimated, our business could be adversely affected. The self-insured groups we manage establish loss reserves as they recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, which represent estimates of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured events that have occurred, including events that have not been reported. Loss reserves are estimates and are inherently uncertain; they do not and cannot represent an exact measure of liability. The self-insured groups loss reserve estimates are based on estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims and on actuarial estimation techniques. Several factors contribute to the uncertainty in establishing these estimates. Judgment is required in actuarial estimation to ascertain the relevance of historical payment and claim settlement patterns under current facts and circumstances. Key assumptions in the estimation of claims over time include the increasing level of medical, legal and rehabilitation costs, frequency risks, fluctuations in inflation, prevailing economic, social and judicial trends, legislative changes, third party claims handling procedures and costs associated with fraud or other abuses of the medical claim process. Connected with adverse claims development experienced by the Healthcare Industry Trust of New York, or HITNY, the New York Workers Compensation Board conducted an inquiry into the actuarial work done by a third-party actuary retained by HITNY. We provided testimony and copies of the underlying data that was submitted by the actuary to the New York Workers Compensation Board. The New York Workers Compensation Board also received testimony from the third-party actuary. We also understand that the actuary provided the New York Workers Compensation Board with a written independent report from another qualified independent actuary who specializes in performing such reviews. This report verified that all actuarial methods used and actuarial judgments made were in accordance with sound actuarial principles and standards. As of the date of this annual report, all testimony and discovery have been completed in the inquiry, we are awaiting a final decision from the New York 35 Table of Contents Workers Compensation Board and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the inquiry. However, as result of this inquiry, the New York Workers Compensation Board required that the loss reserves for each of the self-insured groups that were reviewed by the third party actuary, including HITNY, undergo an actuarial review by an independent actuarial firm engaged by the New York Workers Compensation Board. To the extent the loss reserves for any of the self-insured groups we manage, including those groups in New York which we no longer manage as a result of their election to cease active operations, are insufficient to cover the groups actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, the group will have to adjust its loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on the groups financial condition and cash flows and could require the group to assess its members. This could expose us to liability for our management of a group, have a negative impact on our future management of groups, and adversely affect our reputation as a self-insured group manager. Additionally, in the course of run-off, our New York self-insured that have ceased active operations may undergo forensic audits and depending on the results of such audits, the groups former members may be assessed for any deficits, in which case we may be subject to claims by the groups or their former members regarding our prior management. We operate as a third party administrator for our New York self-insured groups, which requires a license from the New York Workers Compensation Board, and our failure to maintain this license could adversely affect our business. Part of the services we provide our groups in New York includes acting as the groups third party administrator, or TPA. This requires us to be responsible for the administration and defense of the claims of the groups members. We provide TPA services as part of the management fees we receive from our groups. Operating as a TPA requires us to maintain a license issued by the New York Workers Compensation Board, which has discretion to deny or revoke TPA licenses for various reasons. If we do not have the requisite TPA license and approval from the New York Workers Compensation Board or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the New York Workers Compensation Board could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. After an exchange of correspondence in which the New York Workers Compensation Board expressed dissatisfaction with our response to a request for certain information relating to the actuarial review of the loss reserves for HITNY, the New York Workers Compensation Board notified us on February 8, 2008 that a referral had been made for a formal investigation into whether disciplinary action should be taken with regard to our TPA license. We vigorously disagree with the characterizations made by the New York Workers Compensation Board. The procedure initiated by the New York Workers Compensation Board is in an investigative stage. We are not able at this time to determine what the outcome of the investigation may be nor what, if any, financial or operational consequences may result form the proceeding. If we fail to maintain our TPA license or fail to continue offering claims management services to our groups in New York, our ability to maintain a portion of our fee-based management services business could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, if the New York Workers Compensation Board decides to suspend or revoke our TPA license, it is also possible that New York Workers Compensation Board could place restrictions on our ability to perform other group administrator services for our remaining New York group. Regardless of the outcome of New York Workers Compensation Boards investigation, we expect that revenues from our fee-based management services in New York will be significantly reduced in 2008. We do not currently intend to form any additional self-insurance groups in New York nor are we actively seeking to add additional members to our remaining New York group. If the New York Workers Compensation Board were to place such restrictions our ability to offer group administrator services to our New York groups, our ability to continue manage our remaining New York self-insured group or effectively re-enter the New York self-insurance group market in the future if market conditions improve may be materially impaired. Additionally, our reputation as a manager of self-insurance groups generally may be negatively impacted in such an event. 36 Table of Contents We may be deemed to have a conflict of interest in concurrently managing self-insured groups and placing the excess coverage for these groups with Majestic and also providing primary workers compensation insurance to potential members of the self-insured groups. We act as the insurance broker for the self-insured groups we manage to assist them with the negotiation and purchase of the required excess and frequency coverage. In the past, this coverage for certain of the self-insured groups we manage has been placed with Majestic and a portion of such coverage has been reinsured by Twin Bridges. In addition, we are currently providing primary workers compensation insurance policies to businesses that are potential members of the self-insured groups we manage. Although we have fully disclosed these relationships to the board of trustees of the self-insured groups we manage, it is possible that one or more of our groups could conclude that these relationships present an unacceptable conflict of interest. In this event, we could lose all or a substantial portion of our fee-based management services revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our fee-based management services business may expose us to litigation and liability in excess of our current insurance coverage. The management of our groups exposes us to significant risks. In the past, our fee-based business subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions in the course of their operations. We may have liability for errors or omissions in the services we perform. We may also be liable to our groups, third parties and governmental authorities for, among other things, fines, penalties and regulatory actions. Adverse judgments in multiple lawsuits could require us to pay significant damage amounts in the aggregate. These liabilities may exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient to cover the liabilities we may incur or that we will be able to maintain insurance at reasonable rates or at all. If our policies are terminated and do not contain retroactive coverage, we will not be insured for claims made after the termination of coverage even if these claims are based on events or acts that occurred during the term of the policy. In such an event, we could be exposed to liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Generally Applicable to our Business and Industry Our revenues and results of operation may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including the cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry, which may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile. The results of operations of companies in the insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. Our profitability can be affected significantly by:  competition;  rate increases and decreases;  volatile and unpredictable developments, including frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic and other loss events;  changes in the availability of reinsurance capacity and capital capacity;  rising loss costs that we cannot anticipate at the time we or our groups price insurance products; and  other general economic and social conditions. The supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, the level of insured losses and the level of industry surplus, which, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance and reinsurance industry. As a result, the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry, characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels. The supply of insurance and reinsurance may increase, either due to capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional 37 Table of Contents capital by existing insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates and additional competition for business. During 1998, 1999 and 2000, the workers compensation insurance industry experienced substantial pricing competition, and this pricing competition greatly affected the ability of providers to increase premiums. Beginning in 2001, there was a decrease in pricing competition in the industry, which enabled insurers to raise rates. More recent legislative reforms in many states, including California Bill 899 passed in April 2004 and New Yorks 2007 Workers Compensation Reform Act passed in March 2007, however, have caused premium rates to decrease. The pricing competition has affected our ability to raise rates on our primary workers compensation insurance products. In addition, because our self-insured groups do not have capital and surplus, they do not have the ability to provide coverage at rates that produce a loss after considering investment income and available reinsurance. As a result, our groups may lose members and experience a reduction in their premium revenues during periods of inadequate market pricing. The supply of insurance may increase, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of addition capital by existing insurers, which may cause prices to continue to decrease or remain flat. The insurance and reinsurance market is also subject to intense competition with the rate changes. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly. If rates continue to decrease and competition continues to increase, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive industry and may lack the financial resources to compete effectively. The workers compensation insurance market is highly competitive and, except for regulatory considerations, has very few barriers to entry. We and the self-insured groups we manage compete with many companies and other underwriting organizations in the workers compensation insurance business. Many of the insurance companies we compete against have more capital, name and brand recognition and marketing and management resources than we or the groups we manage have. Many of our competitors have offered, and may continue to offer, workers compensation insurance combined with other insurance coverage. Some of our competitors offer workers compensation insurance on a multi-state basis. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our business strategy in a manner that will allow us to be competitive. If any of our competitors offer premium rates, policy terms or types of insurance that are more competitive than ours, we could lose market share and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result. Negative developments in the workers compensation insurance industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We offer only workers compensation insurance products. As a result of this concentration, negative developments in the economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the workers compensation insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Negative developments in the workers compensation insurance industry could have a greater effect on us than on more diversified insurance companies that also sell other types of insurance. If continued rate declines impair profitability, in any of the states in which we operate, we may elect to reduce the amount of premiums written in such states. If our competitors offer products at prices lower than we believe would be profitable, we may decline to compete at those lower prices and our premium levels could be reduced. Many of our competitors are multi-line carriers that can price the workers compensation insurance that they offer at a loss in order to obtain other lines of business at a profit. As we offer only workers compensation insurance products, we must make a profit on this business and will not lower our price to obtain business below a price that we believe will be profitable for us. The insurance business is subject to extensive regulation that limits the way we can operate our business. We are subject to extensive regulation by the California Department of Insurance and the Bermuda Monetary Authority and other insurance regulatory agencies in each state in which we are licensed. The self-insured groups we manage are subject to extensive regulation by the California Department of Industrial Relations and the New 38 Table of Contents York State Workers Compensation Board. These regulatory agencies have broad regulatory powers designed primarily to protect policyholders and their employees, not our shareholders. Regulations vary from jurisdiction, but typically address or include:  approval of premium, contribution and funding rates;  ratios of assets to liabilities, credit and risk reserves, net worth levels and standards of solvency;  formation of self-insured groups and licensing as a third-party claims administrator;  limits on the size and nature of risks assumed and retained;  reserves for unearned premium, losses and other purposes;  periodic audits and other regulatory reviews of financial statements;  annual reporting and disclosure agreements;  limitations on our ability to transact business with our affiliates;  regulation of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures;  compliance with various licensing requirements and approvals that affect our ability to do business;  approval or rejection of policy coverage and endorsements;  limitations on our investments and dividends;  assessment requirements for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies; and  compliance with medical privacy laws. Insurance departments and state workers compensation or similar boards also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of the insurance companies and groups they regulate and require the filing of periodic, annual and other reports relating to financial condition, approval of new members, groups and other matters. Moreover, the NAIC and the state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations, interpretations of existing laws and proposals for new laws. Such laws, regulations or interpretations by NAIC or state insurance regulators may be more restrictive or result in higher costs to us and the groups we manage. Regulatory authorities have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses or suspend underwriting of business for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. We intend to base some of our practices on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe are generally accepted by the insurance industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we, or the groups we manage, do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us or the groups we manage from carrying on some or all of our or their activities, or otherwise impose penalties. In such an event, our reputation as well as our ability to operate our business would be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to transact business with our affiliates and to enter into mergers, acquisitions and divestitures involving Majestic is limited by the requirements of the insurance holding company laws in California. To comply with these laws, we are required to file notices with the California Department of Insurance to seek its approval at least 30 days before engaging in any inter-company transactions, such as sales, purchases, exchanges of assets, loans, extensions of credit, cost sharing arrangements and extraordinary dividends or other distributions to shareholders. Under these holding company laws, any change of control transaction also requires prior notification and approval. Because these governmental agencies may not take action or give approval within the thirty day period, these notification and approval requirements may subject us to business delays and additional business expense. If we fail to give these notifications, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties and damaged working relations with these governmental agencies. 39 Table of Contents Twin Bridges is subject to regulation and supervision in Bermuda. Among other matters, Bermuda statutes, regulations and policies of the Bermuda Monetary Authority require Twin Bridges to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, statutory capital and surplus, and liquidity, to meet solvency standards, to obtain prior approval of certain issuances and transfers of shares as well as to submit to certain periodic examinations of its financial condition. These statutes and regulations may, in effect, restrict Twin Bridges ability to assume reinsurance, to make certain investments and to distribute funds. We cannot predict whether any change to these regulations will materially and adversely affect our business. Moreover, the offshore insurance and reinsurance regulatory markets have long been the subject of scrutiny by federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. This scrutiny has led to a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to make it more difficult for offshore companies to transact business with U.S. persons. If Twin Bridges were to become subject to any U.S. federal or state law or regulation, Twin Bridges may be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus and may be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing specified types of policies or contracts. Compliance with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance products may not be known until many years after the coverage is initiated. For example, medical costs associated with permanent and partial disabilities may increase more rapidly or be higher than we currently expect. Changes of this nature may expose us to higher claims than we anticipated when we underwrote underlying coverage. Our geographic concentration ties our performance to the business, economic and regulatory conditions in California and New York. Our primary insurance business is concentrated in California which represented 78% of our primary insurance segment net earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our self-insured groups are located in New York and California, which represented 69% and 31% of our fee based revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Unfavorable business, economic or regulatory conditions in either of those two states could negatively impact our business, and, consequently, we are exposed to economic and regulatory risks that are greater than the risks faced by insurance companies that conduct business over a greater geographic area. The California workers compensation market, for example, has been characterized by strong fluctuations during the last decade. High competition among insurers during the 1990s led to significant rate reductions which in turned resulted in multiple insolvencies of insurance companies focused on the California workers compensation market and forced a large number of insurers to withdraw from the market completely. California also increased the benefits payable to injured workers in January 2003. In response to this negative market environment, California regulators issued a number of decisions increasing the advisory pure premium rates and the California legislature enacted a series of reforms of the California workers compensation law which had a net effect of reducing insurer loss costs. For a discussion of the current industry trends in California, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below under the heading Drivers of Profitability  Industry Trends. The New York workers compensation market had remained relatively stable until this year with the adoption of the 2007 Workers Compensation Reform Act in March 2007. This legislative change was intended to create a significantly less expensive system of workers compensation in New York while increasing the weekly benefits paid to injured workers. Following an analysis of the impact of the reforms and market trends associated with New Yorks 2007 Workers Compensation Reform Act, the New York State Superintendent of Insurance ordered that overall policyholders costs for workers compensation were to be reduced by 20.5% effective October 1, 2007, 40 Table of Contents which included both changes in the workers compensation rates set by the New York State Workers Compensation Board as well as a change to the New York State Assessment. Because our business is concentrated in California and New York, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events or other conditions affecting losses in these states could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. We may be exposed to economic and regulatory risks or risk from natural perils that are greater than the risks associated with greater geographic diversification. If we cannot sustain our relationships with our independent agents and brokers, we may be unable to operate profitably. We market and sell our workers compensation insurance products solely through independent agents and brokers. We do not have an exclusive relationship with these independent agents and brokers. They are not obligated to promote our insurance products and may sell insurance products offered by our competitors. Many of our competitors have longer relationships with the independent agencies that we use or intend to use. Further, we must offer workers compensation insurance products that meet the requirements of these agencies and their customers and provide competitive compensation to these agencies. We cannot assure you that we will successfully maintain these relationships, cultivate new ones or be able to meet the future requirements of these independent agents and brokers. In addition, consolidation in the insurance agency and brokerage industry may lead to the loss of one or more of these relationships. The failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with the independent agents from whom we obtain or expect to obtain our business or to develop new relationships would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including state regulatory requirements, the financial stability of reinsurers, and our ability to write new business and establish premium rates sufficient to cover our estimated claims. We may need to raise additional capital or curtail our growth if the capital of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries is insufficient to support future operating requirements and/or cover claims. We are not able to estimate the amount of additional capital we may require in the future or predict the timing of our future capital needs. Any additional equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are able to raise capital through equity financings, your interest in us would be diluted, and the securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to our common shares. If we raise capital through the issuance of debt, the incurrence and repayment of any debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on our key executives, and may not be able to hire and retain additional key employees or successfully integrate new members of our management team and the loss of a key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success will depend largely on our continued reliance on the experience and expertise of our senior management, which includes, among others, Daniel G. Hickey, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer, who has more than 16 years of insurance industry experience. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Hickey and other members of our senior management team, any of our senior managers may terminate his employment with us and seek employment with others who may seek his expertise. The loss of Mr. Hickeys expertise or the expertise of any of our senior management through death, disability or termination of employment could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are not the beneficiary of life or disability insurance covering any of our executives, key employees or other personnel. Our ability to implement our business strategy will also depend on our success in recruiting, retaining and successfully integrating our management team and other personnel. If we are unable to retain employees and to attract and integrate new members of our management team, key employees or other personnel, we may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy in a timely manner. If we are unable to do so or if we were to lose the services of our senior executives or key employees, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 41 Table of Contents Our status as a holding company with no direct operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations, pay dividends, make other payments and redeploy capital among our subsidiaries. CRM Holdings is a holding company that transacts business through its operating subsidiaries, including Majestic, Twin Bridges and CRM. CRM Holdings primary assets are the capital shares and stock of its operating subsidiaries. Dividends and other permitted distributions from our subsidiaries are expected to be our primary source of funds to meet our ongoing cash requirements and other expenses, and to pay dividends, if any, to our shareholders. Insurance regulations in California restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions by Majestic. Bermuda law and regulations, including Bermuda insurance regulations, restrict the declaration and payment of dividends out of retained earnings, and the making of distributions out of contributed surplus, by Twin Bridges unless certain regulatory requirements are met. For a detailed discussion of these restrictions, please see Item I. Business under the heading Regulation above. In addition to these regulatory restrictions, U.S. withholding tax payable on dividends paid to CRM Holdings by our U.S. subsidiaries affects our ability to pay dividends and redeploy capital from our U.S. subsidiaries to our Bermuda operations. Any dividends paid from our U.S. subsidiaries to us would be subject to a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30%. We therefore do not expect to receive dividends from our U.S. subsidiaries for the foreseeable future. The inability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Implementation of our growth strategies is subject to numerous risks and difficulties. Our continuing growth strategy includes expanding in our existing markets, entering new geographic markets, further developing our independent agency relationships, exploring potential new products, exploring and executing potential acquisitions. Our implementation of these strategies is subject to various risks, including risks associated with our ability to:  identify, recruit and integrate new independent agents and brokers;  properly design and price new and existing products and programs;  identify profitable new geographic markets and product lines to enter;  obtain necessary licenses and regulatory approvals;  consider and identify, as necessary, further acquisition candidates and successfully execute and integrate acquisitions we undertake; and  identify, hire and train new underwriting and claims handling employees. We may encounter other difficulties in the implementation of our growth strategies, including unanticipated expenditures and damaged or lost relationships with customers and independent agents and brokers. Our growth strategies include entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Any failure by us to manage our growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our business could be adversely affected by Bermuda employment restrictions. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians and holders of a Permanent Residents Certificate) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. Work permits may be granted or extended by the Bermuda government upon showing that, after proper public advertisement in most cases, no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian) is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position. In 2001, the Bermuda government announced a new policy limiting the duration of work permits to six years, with certain exemptions for key employees. We may not be able to use the services of one or more of our key employees in Bermuda if we are not able to obtain work permits for them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have obtained non-resident work permits for our key employees. If we are unable to renew the work permits for these employees or to obtain work permits for any new employees, we may not be able to conduct our business operations fully or efficiently and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. 42 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Common Shares Future sales of common shares by our directors, officers, affiliates and other shareholders may adversely affect the price, and the future issues of shares under our employee incentive plans may lower the price, of our common shares. We cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of our common shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the trading price of our common shares. Future sales of common shares by our directors, officers, affiliates and other shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common shares at a time and price that you determine appropriate. In addition, additional common shares may be issuable pursuant to our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, pursuant to which we have reserved an aggregate of up to 1,700,000 common shares for issuance. The issuance of shares under these plans will result in a dilution of your investment. Provisions in our charter documents may reduce or increase the voting power associated with our common shares and thereby affect your voting rights. Our bye-laws generally provide that shareholders have one vote for each share held by them and are entitled to vote, on a non-cumulative basis, at all meetings of shareholders. However, pursuant to a mechanism specified in our bye-laws, the voting rights exercisable by a shareholder will be limited so that certain persons or groups are not deemed to hold more than 9.9% of the total voting power conferred by our shares. In addition, our board of directors retains certain discretion to make adjustments to the aggregate number of votes attaching to the shares of any shareholder that they consider fair and reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure that no person will hold more than 9.9% of the total voting power represented by our then outstanding shares. Our bye-laws provide, generally, that any shareholder owning, directly, indirectly or, in the case of any U.S. person, by attribution, more than 9.9% of our common shares will have the voting rights attached to such common shares reduced so that it may not exercise more than 9.9% of the total voting rights. The reduction in votes is generally to be applied proportionately among all shareholders who are members of the first shareholders control group. A control group means, with respect to any person, all shares directly owned by such person and all shares directly owned by each other shareholder any of whose shares are included in the controlled shares of such person. Controlled shares means all common shares that a person is deemed to own directly, indirectly (within the meaning of Section 958(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or the Code) or, in the case of a U.S. person, constructively (within the meaning of Section 958(b) of the Code). A similar limitation is to be applied to shares held directly by members of a related group. A related group means a group of shareholders that are investment vehicles and are under common control and management. Any reduction in votes will generally be applied proportionately among members of the shareholders control group or related group, as the case may be. The amount of any reduction of votes that occurs by operation of the above limitations will generally be reallocated proportionately among all of our other shareholders who were not members of these groups so long as such reallocation does not cause any person to hold more than 9.9% of the total voting power of our shares. The attribution rules with respect to a control group will not apply to Daniel G. Hickey, Sr. and Daniel G. Hickey, Jr. Accordingly, the voting rights of each of Mr. Hickey, Sr. and Mr. Hickey, Jr. will be limited to 9.9% on an individual basis and not on a joint and aggregate basis. Under these provisions, some shareholders may have the right to exercise their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share. Moreover, these provisions could have the effect of reducing the voting power of certain shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership. As a result of any reduction in the votes of other shareholders, your voting power might increase above 5% of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares, which may result in your becoming a reporting person subject to Schedule 13D or 13G filing requirements under the Exchange Act. We also have the authority to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholders voting rights are to be reallocated pursuant to the bye-laws. If a shareholder fails to respond to a 43 Table of Contents request for information from us or submits incomplete or inaccurate information (after a reasonable cure period) in response to a request, we, in our reasonable discretion, may reduce or eliminate the shareholders voting rights. Anti-takeover provisions in our bye-laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors, which could diminish the value of our common shares. Our bye-laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In addition, these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. For example, these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future. Examples of provisions in our bye-laws that could have such an effect include the following:  election of our directors is staggered, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of our directors are elected each year;  the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 9.9% of our common shares will be reduced to 9.9% of the total voting power of our common shares; and  our directors may, in their discretion, decline to record the transfer of any common shares on our share register if the shares have not been fully paid for, if the directors are not satisfied that all required regulatory approvals for such transfer have been obtained, if as a result of the transfer a shareholder would own more than 9.9% of our common shares, or if the instrument of transfer is in favor of more than five persons jointly. U.S. persons who own our common shares may have more difficulty protecting their interests than U.S. persons who are shareholders of a U.S. corporation. The Companies Act, which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. In order to highlight those differences, we have set forth below a summary of certain significant provisions of the Companies Act, including, where relevant, information on our bye-laws, which differ in certain respects from the provisions of Delaware corporate law. Further, under certain circumstances, our bye-laws impose greater restrictions on us than required by the Companies Act. Because the following statements are summaries, they do not discuss all aspects of Bermuda law that may be relevant to us and our shareholders. Shareholders Suits. The rights of shareholders under Bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders in many United States jurisdictions. Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under Bermuda law. However, the Bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow English case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to commence a derivative action in the name of a company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company, is illegal or would result in the violation of such companys memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it. The successful party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of the attorneys fees incurred in connection with such action. Our bye-laws provide that shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have, individually or in our right, against any director or officer or any person appointed to any committee by the board of directors or resident representative for any action or failure to act in the performance of his duties, except such waiver shall not extend to any claims or rights of action that would render the waiver void pursuant to the Companies Act and arise out of fraud or dishonesty on the part of such person or with respect to the recovery of any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such person is not legally entitled. Conversely, class actions and derivative actions generally are available to shareholders under Delaware corporate law, for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law. In such actions under Delaware corporate law, the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover attorneys fees in connection with such action. 44 Table of Contents Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Under Bermuda law and our bye-laws, we will indemnify our directors or officers or any person appointed to any committee by the board of directors and any resident representative (and their respective heirs, executors or administrators) against all actions, costs, charges, liabilities, loss, damage or expense, to the fullest extent permitted by law, incurred or suffered by such officer, director or other person by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of our business or in the discharge of his duties; provided that such indemnification shall not extend to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of such director, officer or other person. Under Bermuda law, a company pursuant to (a) the terms of its bye-laws, or (b) a contract or arrangement between the company and any director, officer or auditor, may advance moneys to any director, officer or auditor for the costs, charges and expenses incurred by the officer or auditor in defending any civil or criminal proceedings against them, on condition that the officer or auditor shall repay the advance if any allegation of fraud dishonesty is proved against them. In general, under Delaware corporate law, U.S. companies may limit the personal liability of their directors as long as they acted in good faith and reasonably believed their actions were not opposed to the best interests of the company and, with regard to criminal actions or proceedings, without knowing violation of law. We are a Bermuda company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us. We are a Bermuda company and a significant portion of our assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the United States. It may therefore be difficult for shareholders to affect service of process against us or to enforce against us judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. There is no treaty in force between the United States and Bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As a result, whether a United States judgment would be enforceable in Bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the U.S. court that entered the judgment is recognized by the Bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers, as determined by reference to Bermuda conflict of law rules. A judgment debt from a U.S. court that is final and for a sum certain based on U.S. federal securities laws will not be enforceable in Bermuda unless the judgment debtor had submitted to the jurisdiction of the U.S. court, and the issue of submission and jurisdiction is a matter of Bermuda (not United States) law. In addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues, the Bermuda courts will not enforce a United States federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to the public policy of Bermuda. An action brought pursuant to a public or penal law, the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction, power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity, may not be entertained by a Bermuda court. Certain remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including certain remedies under U.S. federal securities laws, will not be available under Bermuda law or enforceable in a Bermuda court, as they may be contrary to Bermuda public policy. Further, no claim may be brought in Bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violations of U.S. federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under Bermuda law and do not have force of law in Bermuda. A Bermuda court may, however, impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Bermuda law. Risks Related to Taxation CRM Holdings and its non-U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation. If CRM Holdings or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, including Twin Bridges, were treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States, that entity could be subject to U.S. income and branch profits tax on all or a portion of the income that is effectively connected with such trade or business. We intend to operate in a manner such that neither CRM Holdings nor any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries will be treated as being engaged in a trade or business in the United States. Accordingly, we do not believe that CRM Holdings or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are or will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on net income. However, this determination is essentially factual in nature, and there are no definitive standards as to what activities constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, would not find that CRM Holdings or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is engaged in a trade or business in the 45 Table of Contents United States. Any liability for income or branch profits tax resulting from such finding could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Even if CRM Holdings and our non-U.S. subsidiaries are not treated as being engaged in a trade or business in the United States, we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on certain fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income (such as dividends and certain interest on investments) derived from sources within the United States. Any of our U.S. subsidiaries may be deemed a personal holding company and subject to additional U.S. federal income tax. Any of CRM Holdings U.S. subsidiaries might be subject to additional U.S. federal income tax on a portion of its income if it is considered a personal holding company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This status will depend on whether more than 50% of our shares by value could be deemed to be owned (taking into account indirect and constructive ownership) by five or fewer individuals and whether 60% or more of such subsidiarys adjusted ordinary gross income consists of personal holding company income, which is, in general, certain forms of passive and investment income. We believe based upon information made available to us regarding our existing shareholder base that none of CRM Holdings U.S. subsidiaries should be considered a personal holdings company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we intend to manage our business to minimize the possibility that we will meet the 60% income threshold. However, because of the lack of complete information regarding our ultimate common share ownership (i.e., as determined by the constructive ownership rules for personal holdings companies), we cannot be certain that any of CRM Holdings subsidiaries will not be considered a personal holding company or that the amount of U.S. tax that would be imposed in that case would be immaterial Shareholders who are U.S. persons may recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes on our undistributed earnings. Shareholders who are U.S. persons may recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes on our undistributed earnings if we are treated as a controlled foreign corporation or a passive foreign investment company or if we have generated more than a permissible amount of related person insurance income. In addition, gain on the disposition of our common shares may be treated as dividend income. Controlled Foreign Corporation. Each 10% U.S. Shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation for an uninterrupted period of thirty days or more during a taxable year, and that owns shares in the controlled foreign corporation directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the corporations taxable year on which such corporation was a controlled foreign corporation, must include in its gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the controlled foreign corporations subpart F income, even if the subpart F income is not distributed. Subpart F income generally includes, among other things, investment income such as dividends, interest and capital gains, and income from insuring risks located outside the insurers country of incorporation. A foreign corporation is considered a controlled foreign corporation if 10% U.S. Shareholders own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of the foreign corporation, or the total value of all stock of the corporation. A 10% U.S. Shareholder is a U.S. person, as defined in the Code, that owns at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the foreign corporation entitled to vote. For purposes of taking into account subpart F income consisting of insurance income, a controlled foreign corporation also includes a foreign corporation of which more than 25% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock (or more than 25% of the total value of the stock) is owned by 10% U.S. Shareholders, on any day during the taxable year of such corporation, if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts generating subpart F income exceeds 75% of the gross amount of premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks. It is expected that all of Twin Bridges income will be considered subpart F insurance income. For purposes of determining whether the more-than-50% (or more-than-25%, in the case of insurance income) and 10% ownership tests have been satisfied, and therefore whether a corporation is a controlled foreign corporation, shares owned includes shares owned directly or indirectly through foreign entities or shares considered owned under constructive ownership rules. The attribution rules are complicated and depend on the particular facts relating to each investor. 46 Table of Contents CRM Holdings bye-laws contain provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of its shares. Accordingly, based upon these provisions and the dispersion of our share ownership, we do not believe that we have any 10% U.S. Shareholders. It is possible, however that the IRS could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge. Passive Foreign Investment Company. We do not intend to conduct our activities in a manner that would cause us to become a passive foreign investment company. However, it is possible that we could be deemed a passive foreign investment company by the IRS. If we were considered a passive foreign investment company it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation, including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply or subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed. There are currently no regulations regarding the application of the passive foreign investment company provisions to an insurance company. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be issued in the future. We cannot predict what impact, if any, this guidance would have on a shareholder that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation. We have not sought and do not intend to seek an opinion of legal counsel as to whether or not we were a passive foreign investment company for any year. Related Person Insurance Income. If Twin Bridges gross related person insurance income equals or exceeds 20% of its gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds (and persons related to such insureds) own (or are treated as owning directly or indirectly) 20% or more of the voting power or value of the shares of Twin Bridges and U.S. persons are considered to own in the aggregate 25% or more of the stock of Twin Bridges by vote or value, then a U.S. person who owns any of our shares directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of Twin Bridges taxable year on which it is a controlled foreign corporation would be required to include in its income for U.S. federal income tax purposes the shareholders pro rata share of Twin Bridges related person insurance income for the U.S. persons taxable year that includes the end of Twin Bridges taxable year determined as if such related person insurance income were distributed proportionately to such U.S. shareholders at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed. In addition any related person insurance income that is includible in the income of a U.S. tax-exempt organization will be treated as unrelated business taxable income. The amount of related person insurance income earned by Twin Bridges (generally, premium and related investment income from the direct or indirect insurance or reinsurance of any direct or indirect U.S. shareholder of Twin Bridges or any person related to such shareholder) will depend on a number of factors, including the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or reinsured by Twin Bridges. Although we do not expect our gross related person insurance income to equal or exceed 20% of our gross insurance income in the foreseeable future, some of the factors which determine the extent of related person insurance income in any period may be beyond Twin Bridges control. Consequently, Twin Bridges gross related person insurance income could equal or exceed 20% of its gross insurance income in any taxable year and ownership of its shares by direct or indirect insureds and related persons could equal or exceed the 20% threshold described above. The related person insurance income rules provide that if a shareholder that is a U.S. person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has related person insurance income (even if the amount of related person insurance income is less than 20% of the corporations gross insurance income or the ownership of its shares by direct or indirect insureds and related persons is less than the 20% threshold) and in which U.S. persons own 25% or more of the shares, any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholders share of the corporations undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares (whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to related person insurance income). In addition, such a shareholder will be required to comply with reporting requirements, regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder. We believe that these rules should not apply to dispositions of our shares because CRM Holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business and because proposed U.S. Treasury regulations appear to apply only in the case of shares of corporations that are directly engaged in the insurance business. However, the IRS might interpret the proposed regulations in a different manner and the applicable proposed regulations may be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of our shares. 47 Table of Contents Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could materially adversely affect an investment in our common shares. Legislation is periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress intended to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies (including insurance and reinsurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the United State but have certain U.S. connections. For example, on September 26, 2007, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance conducted a hearing concerning the tax issues connected with the offshore reinsurance industry. While we believe there are no currently pending legislative proposal from this hearing or otherwise which, if enacted, would have a material adverse impact on us or our shareholders, it is possible that legislative proposals could emerge in the future that could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders. CRM Holdings could be considered a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and thus subject to U.S. tax on its worldwide income (including current income of Twin Bridges), if the value of Twin Bridges at the time of our restructuring did not exceed 20% of the total value of CRM, CRM CA, Eimar and Twin Bridges at that time. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provides that, if a foreign corporation acquires substantially all of the assets of a U.S. corporation, and 80% or more of the stock of the foreign corporation (excluding new stock issued in a public offering related to the acquisition) is owned by former shareholders of the U.S. corporation by reason of their ownership of the U.S. corporation, the foreign corporation will be considered a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In our restructuring, the former owners of CRM and Eimar contributed all of their interests in CRM and Eimar to CRM USA Holdings in return for all of the common stock of CRM USA Holdings. The former owners of CRM and Eimar then contributed all of their CRM USA Holdings shares to us in exchange for 6,372,425 of our common shares. In addition, in our restructuring, the former owners of Twin Bridges contributed all of their shares in Twin Bridges to us in exchange for 3,874,690 of our common shares. As a result of these exchanges, the former owners of CRM, Eimar and Twin Bridges acquired 9,457,115 of our common shares and 790,000 of our Class B shares in our restructuring. Based on discussions with our professional advisors at the time of our restructuring, we believe that the former owners of CRM and Eimar did not obtain 80% or more of the stock of CRM Holdings (excluding the stock sold in our initial public offering) by reason of their ownership of CRM and Eimar (i.e., we believe that Twin Bridges was worth more than 20% of the combined value of CRM, CRM CA, Eimar and Twin Bridges). We cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with our conclusions. If the IRS successfully challenges our conclusions, CRM Holdings would be subject to United States federal income tax on its worldwide income at the rate applicable to U.S. corporations, which is currently 35%, rather than being subject to tax on only certain U.S. source income and income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. However, in that case, dividends paid to CRM Holdings by its U.S. subsidiaries would not be subject to any U.S. federal income tax, nor would they be subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax. The tax liability that would result if CRM Holdings is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016. The Bermuda Minister of Finance, under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, of Bermuda has given each of CRM Holdings and Twin Bridges an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to CRM Holdings or Twin Bridges or any of their operations, shares, debentures or other obligations until March 28, 2016. Given the limited duration of the Minister of Finances assurance, we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any Bermuda tax after March 28, 2016. In the event that we become subject to any Bermuda tax after such date, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B.
