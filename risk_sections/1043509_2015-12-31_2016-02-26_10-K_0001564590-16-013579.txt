RISK FACTORS Impairment of our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our earnings. Pursuant to applicable accounting pronouncements, we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We describe the process for testing goodwill more thoroughly in “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies.” If we determine that the amount of our goodwill is impaired at any point in time, we are required to reduce goodwill on our balance sheet. If goodwill is impaired based on a future impairment test, we will be required to record a significant non-cash impairment charge that may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the impairment of goodwill occurs. As of December 31, 2015, our balance sheet reflected a carrying amount of approximately $471.5 million in goodwill. 23 SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments.
