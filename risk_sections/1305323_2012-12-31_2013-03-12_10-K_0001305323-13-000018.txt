Item 1A. Risk Factors.Investing in our common stock involves risk. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this report, including our annual consolidated financial statements and Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks we face. Any of the risks described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not believed by us to be material could also impact us.Risks Related to the Extensive Regulation of Our BusinessIf our institutions fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, they could face monetary liabilities or penalties, operational restrictions, or loss of access to Title IV programs from which we derive most of our revenue.In the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Ashford University derived 86.4%, 86.8% and 85.0%, respectively, and the University of the Rockies derived 87.3%, 85.0% and 85.9%, respectively, of their revenues (in each case calculated in accordance with applicable regulations of the U.S. Department of Education (“Department”)) from federal student aid programs administered by the Department, which programs we refer to as Title IV programs. If our institutions were to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or were to have such participation substantially curtailed, enrollments, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.To participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be (1) legally authorized to operate in the state in which it is physically located, (2) accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department as a reliable indicator of educational quality, and (3) certified as an eligible institution by the Department. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulation by state education agencies, our institutions' accrediting agency and the Department. These regulatory requirements cover many aspects of our operations; they also restrict our ability to acquire or open new schools, to add new or expand existing educational programs, to change our corporate structure or ownership, and to make other substantive changes. If one of our institutions fails to comply with these regulatory requirements, the Department could impose sanctions on that institution, including (depending on the nature of the noncompliance):•transferring an institution from the advance method or the heightened cash monitoring level one method of Title IV payment, which permit the institution to receive Title IV funds before or concurrently with disbursing them to students, to the heightened cash monitoring level two method of payment or to the reimbursement method of payment, which delay an institution's receipt of Title IV funds until student eligibility has been verified;•imposing monetary liability against the institution in an amount equal to any funds determined to have been improperly disbursed or improperly not to have been returned upon student withdrawal;•requiring the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department as a condition for continued Title IV eligibility;•initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's participation in Title IV programs;•referring a matter for possible civil or criminal investigation;•failing to grant the institution's application for renewal of its certification to participate in Title IV programs or imposing conditions on its participation in Title IV programs; or•taking emergency action to suspend the institution's participation in Title IV programs without prior notice or a prior opportunity for a hearing.Given that state education agencies, HLC and the Department periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements, we cannot predict with certainty how all of these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether we will be able to comply with all of the requirements. In the following paragraphs, we have described some of the most significant risks related to the ability of us and our institutions to comply with regulations issued by the Department, HLC and state education agencies.The Department's Office of Inspector General conducted a compliance audit of Ashford University and issued a final audit report that contains findings of noncompliance and recommendations for certain administrative remedies.On January 21, 2011, Ashford University received a final audit report from the Department's Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) regarding the compliance audit commenced in May 2008 and covering the period July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007. 29The audit covered Ashford University's administration of Title IV program funds, including compliance with regulations governing institutional and student eligibility, awards and disbursements of Title IV program funds, verification of awards and returns of unearned funds during that period, and its compensation of financial aid and recruiting personnel during the period May 10, 2005 through June 30, 2009.The final audit report contained audit findings, in each case for the period July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007 (award year 2006-2007), and related recommendations to the Department's Office of Federal Student Aid (“FSA”). For more information regarding the OIG's final audit report and the findings and recommendations contained therein, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Compliance reviews, audits and reports” in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Ashford University expects that the FSA will consider the findings and recommendations in the final audit report and engage in a dialog with the university prior to determining what, if any, action to take. In June 2011, in connection with Findings 2 and 3, the FSA requested that Ashford University conduct a review of the return to Title IV calculations for all Title IV recipients who withdrew from distance education programs during the 2006-2007 award year. Ashford cooperated with the FSA's request and supplied information within the time frame required. If the FSA were to determine to assess a monetary liability or commence an action to limit, suspend or terminate the university's participation in Title IV programs, Ashford University would have an opportunity to contest the assessment or proposed action through a series of administrative proceedings, with the right to seek review of any final administrative action in the federal courts. Although we believe Ashford University operates in substantial compliance with Department regulations that are applicable to the areas under review, we cannot predict the ultimate extent of the potential liability or remedial actions, if any, that might result from the recommendations by the OIG in the final audit report. Such findings and related remedial action could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, the ability to recruit students and our business.Our institutions' failure to maintain accreditation would result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Ashford University has been placed on Notice by its principal accreditor and its accreditation is under review.An institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department to participate in Title IV programs. Each of our institutions is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (“HLC”), which is recognized by the Department as a reliable authority regarding the quality of education and training provided by the institutions it accredits. To remain accredited, our institutions must continuously meet accreditation standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. If either of our institutions fails to satisfy any of HLC's standards, it could lose its accreditation.On July 12, 2012, Ashford University received a letter from HLC stating that (1) Ashford University had been placed on special monitoring because of the decision by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (“WASC”) to deny the institution initial accreditation and also because of certain other non-financial data provided by the institution that indicated a need for further commission review, and (2) the institution would be required to provide a report to HLC regarding its fulfillment of the commission's Criteria for Accreditation and Core Components, including the Minimum Expectations. Submission of the report was followed by an advisory visit.On February 27, 2013, Ashford University received a letter from HLC stating that on February 21, 2013 the university was placed on Notice due to its current non-compliance with HLC's substantial presence policy and concerns regarding its future ability to remain in compliance with certain accreditation criteria, particularly the revised criteria that became effective on January 1, 2013. Specifically, HLC noted that its action in placing the university on Notice was related in part to the alignment of the university mission with its instructional model, governance of the university independent from its corporate parent, sufficiency of faculty, assessment of student learning and use of data to improve graduation and retention rates, and shared governance structures involving faculty and administration. Ashford University remains accredited. Notice is a commission sanction indicating that an institution is pursuing a course of action that, if continued, could lead it to be out of compliance with one or more criteria for accreditation. See “Regulation - Notification from HLC regarding placement of Ashford University on Notice” in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information. In addition, as discussed under “Notification from HLC regarding Jurisdiction over Ashford University and University of the Rockies” in “Regulation-Accreditation” in Part I, Item 1 of this report, HLC determined that Ashford University is not currently in compliance with HLC's substantial presence policy and set forth procedures and a timeline for evaluating the university's implementation of its previously reviewed plan with respect to substantial presence in the event Ashford University does not gain accreditation from the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, or WASC. See the risk factor below entitled, “If Ashford University fails to demonstrate that it is within the HLC's jurisdiction, the institution could lose accreditation.”30On or before July 10, 2013, Ashford University must provide a monitoring report to HLC stating whether the university has gained accreditation from WASC. If the university has not by such time been accredited by WASC, the university will also be required to host a focused evaluation no later than October 1, 2013, to evaluate, among other things, whether the university has completed specific steps, following its implementation plan, to establish presence in HLC's region as required pursuant to HLC's jurisdictional requirements. Ashford University will be required to host a focused evaluation on or before December 15, 2013 to examine retention, graduation and the university's progress in resolving the identified issues. This evaluation will take place whether or not the university gains WASC accreditation if HLC remains the gatekeeper for Ashford University's Title IV funds or if the university has not voluntarily resigned its HLC accreditation. In its letter, HLC states that the HLC Board will consider information provided in the monitoring report and in the October 2013 focused evaluation, if it is required, and the December 2013 focused evaluation at its meeting in February 2014 and take action as appropriate. HLC may remove the university from Notice, or in the event the identified concerns, including satisfaction of HLC's jurisdictional requirements, have not been satisfactorily addressed, place the university on probation or take other action, which could include a show-cause order or withdrawal of accreditation.On July 24, 2012, HLC notified University of the Rockies that it had been identified for further inquiry based on certain non-financial data the institution provided in its 2012 Institutional Annual Report. Under HLC's Institutional Update process, all accredited and candidate institutions are required to provide certain financial and non-financial data to the commission annually; the commission then screens the non-financial data for seven indicator conditions and requests an institutional report from institutions that meet certain of these conditions. The purpose of the screening process is to identify institutions that may be at risk of not meeting certain of HLC's Criteria for Accreditation. HLC has requested that University of the Rockies provide a report to the commission demonstrating the institution's ability to continue meeting the Core Components in light of the conditions at the institution that led to the indicators being identified. This report was provided on August 29, 2012, and the institution has not received an update regarding the inquiry since that date. The HLC staff will review the report, may request additional information if necessary, and will determine whether the report obviates the need for further review or requires further review by a panel; in the latter case, the panel will review the report and recommend whether the commission should accept the report, require further monitoring through a subsequent report or focused visit, or recommend action such as placing the institution on sanction.Loss of accreditation would denigrate the value of our institutions' educational programs and would cause them to lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.If Ashford University fails to demonstrate that it is within the HLC's jurisdiction, the institution could lose accreditation.In June 2010, the HLC Board of Trustees (“HLC Board”) adopted revised bylaws which outline the basis on which an institution falls within HLC's jurisdiction. The revised bylaws provide, subject to specified grace periods and grandfathering provisions, that an institution must be incorporated within a state in the 19-state north central region and also have a “substantial presence” in the north central region, as defined by commission policy, to be considered within the commission's jurisdiction. In November 2010, HLC adopted a policy which specifies that an institution would be considered to have a “substantial presence” in the north central region only if the institution can demonstrate to the commission that its operations are substantially in the north central region. The institution must provide evidence that the majority of its educational administration and activity, business operations and executive and administrative leadership are located or operating within the north central region and that it has at least one campus or additional location, as applicable, located in the north central region.Ashford University has its campus in, is incorporated in, and has business operations, administration and leadership in Iowa, which is located in the north central region. Ashford University also has business operations, administration and leadership located outside of the north central region. On June 25, 2012, HLC informed Ashford University that the institution must demonstrate, no later than December 1, 2012, that it has a “substantial presence,” as defined by commission policy, in the 19-state north central region and accordingly is within HLC's jurisdiction under new requirements which became effective on July 1, 2012. Representatives of the institution met with HLC regarding the timing and components of becoming compliant with the commission's jurisdictional requirements in light of the institution's plans to reapply for initial accreditation with WASC.Subsequent to these discussions, on July 27, 2012, Ashford University received a letter from HLC that stated Ashford University would be required to provide the commission with an implementation plan on or before December 1, 2012, that demonstrates how the institution will comply with the commission's policy on substantial presence in the event that a migration to WASC either will not occur or is significantly delayed. The implementation plan was provided on November 30, 2012.On or before July 10, 2013, Ashford University must provide an interim report to HLC stating whether or not the university has gained accreditation from WASC. If the university has not by such time been accredited by WASC, the 31university will be required to host a focused evaluation no later than October 1, 2013 to evaluate whether it has completed specific steps, following its implementation plan, to establish presence in HLC's region as required pursuant to HLC's jurisdictional requirements. In addition, Ashford University will be required to host a focused evaluation on or before December 15, 2013 to examine retention, graduation and the university's progress in resolving the identified issues. This evaluation will take place whether or not the university gains WASC accreditation if HLC remains the gatekeeper for Ashford University's Title IV funds or if the university has not voluntarily resigned its HLC accreditation.Loss of accreditation would denigrate the value of Ashford University's educational programs and would cause the institution to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If Ashford University is required to comply with HLC's jurisdictional requirements, it will implement a plan to consolidate a significant portion of its educational administration and activity, business operations and executive and administrative leadership in the 19-state north central region, which could result in management distraction, business disruption and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Ashford University's application for initial accreditation to WASC was denied, which has adversely affected the institution's academic reputation and may negatively impact its ability to enroll and retain students. The institution's attempt to reapply for initial accreditation may also be unsuccessful.In September 2010, Ashford University initiated the process of seeking regional accreditation from WASC. If Ashford University is unable to obtain initial accreditation from WASC, the institution's academic reputation and enrollments could be negatively affected. Additionally, if Ashford University does not receive WASC accreditation and loses accreditation from HLC (see the risk factor above entitled “If Ashford University fails to demonstrate that it is within the HLC's jurisdiction, the institution could lose accreditation” the risk factor below entitled “Our institutions' failure to maintain accreditation would result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Ashford University has been placed on Notice by its principal accreditor and its accreditation is under review”), the institution would no longer be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by the Department and would be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs until it obtained accreditation by another accrediting body recognized by the Department, at which time it would need to file an application with the Department for reinstatement. Ashford University has been placed on Notice by HLC. Under Department regulation, an institution may not be considered eligible to participate in the Title IV programs for 24 months after it has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated for cause, unless the accrediting agency that took that action rescinds that action. If Ashford University becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, it will have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenue, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.On July 5, 2012, Ashford University received official notice from WASC that the accrediting body acted to deny initial accreditation to the institution. WASC found that Ashford University had not yet demonstrated substantial compliance with certain of the WASC Standards for Accreditation, as would be required for initial accreditation. The denial of initial accreditation by WASC has adversely affected Ashford University's academic reputation and may negatively impact its ability to enroll and retain students. A significant decline in student enrollment at Ashford University could materially and adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Furthermore, although Ashford University has reapplied for initial accreditation from WASC, such efforts may be unsuccessful. As a result, the institution's academic reputation and ability to enroll and retain students may further deteriorate. In addition, to remain eligible for Title IV programs, Ashford University would be required to maintain its accreditation with HLC, including satisfying the commission's jurisdictional requirements, which will require the institution to consolidate a significant portion of its educational administration and activity, business operations and executive and administrative leadership in HLC's north central region. Ashford University has been placed on Notice by HLC. Such consolidation could result in management distraction, business disruption and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Currently, the institution's academic and administrative activity is concentrated in San Diego, California. For more information regarding HLC's jurisdictional rules and related risks, see the risk factor above entitled “If Ashford University fails to demonstrate that is within HLC's jurisdiction, the institution could lose accreditation.”As a result of recent negative publicity and changes that may be required by Ashford University's accreditors to the institution's operations and business model, including the possibility that our institutions will be required to relocate their California-based operations and employees to HLC's north central region, our historical financial and business results may not necessarily be representative of future results.The denial of initial accreditation by WASC has adversely affected Ashford University's academic reputation and may negatively impact its ability to enroll and retain students. Moreover, as Ashford University has withdrawn its request for review of the WASC decision, in order for the institution to demonstrate that it has satisfactorily addressed the conclusions of the 32WASC visiting team report and has come into compliance with the WASC Standards of Accreditation (as part of the institution's reapplication process), the institution has launched various new initiatives. HLC may also require significant changes to Ashford University's operations and business model as part of its placement of the institution on Notice. Additionally, if Ashford University is not accredited by WASC in June 2013, it will be required to initiate the move its core operations to HLC's 19-state north central region immediately after the anticipated June 2013 WASC decision in order to comply with HLC's jurisdictional requirements, which require that the institution have a substantial presence in the north central region. This could result in management distraction, business disruption and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Accordingly, although we continue to see a demand for postsecondary education and Title IV funds continue to be available to current and prospective students, our historical results and trends, including enrollments, admissions advisory and marketing expenses and instructional costs and services, may not be indicative of our future results.The Department is conducting a program review of University of the Rockies, which may result in the repayment of Title IV funds and may lead to fines, penalties, or other sanctions, and damage to the institution's reputation in the industry.The Department periodically reviews institutions participating in Title IV programs for compliance with applicable standards and regulations. On July 25, 2012, the Department notified University of the Rockies that it has scheduled an on-site program review. This review occurred from August 20, 2012 through August 24, 2012. The review is intended to assess the institution's administration of Title IV programs and initially will cover the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 award years, but may be expanded if deemed appropriate by the Department. Pursuant to standard Department procedures, the University of the Rockies will be provided the Department's initial Program Review Report and will then have a period of time within which to respond. Following consideration of the response, the FSA would issue a Final Program Review Determination (“FPRD”) letter. If the FPRD were to include significant findings of non-compliance, University of the Rockies could be required, subject to administrative review procedures, to pay a fine, return Title IV funds previously received, or be subjected to other administrative sanctions. While we cannot currently predict the final outcome of the Department review, any such final adverse finding could damage the institution's reputation in the industry and negatively impact enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Action by the U.S. Congress to revise the laws governing Title IV programs or to reduce funding for these programs could negatively impact our business.The U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (the “Higher Education Act”), and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program. In 2008, the Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 30, 2014 by the Higher Education Opportunity Act. The U.S. Congress may propose and pass revisions to the Higher Education Act between reauthorizations, subject to approval by the President. The U.S. Congress also determines the funding levels for Title IV programs annually through the budget and appropriations process. Any action by the U.S. Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the eligibility of our institutions or students to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.For example, as the federal Pell Grant program is one of the largest non-defense discretionary spending programs in the federal budget, it is a potential target for reduction as the U.S. Congress addresses unprecedented budget deficits. Subsidized Stafford loans are also a potential target for reduction. Under the Pell Grant program, the Department makes grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need; likewise, subsidized Stafford loans are federally guaranteed loans based on financial need. Interest does not accrue on subsidized Stafford loans while a student is in school at least half time, or during any future grace or deferment periods; the federal government pays the interest on such loans during these times. If in the future funding is reduced for the Pell Grant program (such as a reduction in the maximum award amount), if fewer students or programs are deemed eligible for the Pell Grant Program or if loan interest subsidies are eliminated for Stafford loans (e.g., eligibility for such loans has been eliminated for graduate students effective July 1, 2012), all of which measures have been proposed in recent Congressional budget negotiations, our institution might become less affordable for certain students at our institutions, which could negatively impact enrollments, revenue, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Additionally, there has been increased focus by the U.S. Congress on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. In particular, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee of the U.S. Senate (“HELP Committee”) has issued several reports and held a series of hearings regarding the proprietary education sector and Title IV programs, including a March 2011 hearing specifically about us and Ashford University entitled “Bridgepoint Education, Inc.: A Case Study in For-Profit Education and Oversight.” In connection with these hearings, the HELP Committee requested a broad range of detailed information from various proprietary institutions, including Ashford University and University of the Rockies; we and our institutions cooperated with these requests. Most recently, on July 29, 2012, the majority staff of the HELP Committee issued a report entitled “For Profit Higher Education: The Failure to Safeguard the Federal Investment and Ensure 33Student Success,” which contains the staff's findings from the committee's two-year investigation of the proprietary education sector. The report is critical of the sector generally and of us and our institutions specifically, expressing concerns surrounding the amount of Title IV and other federal funds received, the amount of money spent on marketing and recruiting, student retention and default rates, staffing levels, learning outcomes and accreditation, among other items.We cannot predict what legislation, if any, will emanate from the HELP Committee hearings, the process of reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, or other Congressional deliberations, or what impact any such legislation might have on the proprietary education sector and our business in particular. Congressional action could also require us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our administrative costs and reduce our profit margin, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.If the Higher Learning Commission loses recognition by the Department, our institutions could lose their ability to participate in Title IV programs.If the Department ceased to recognize HLC for any reason, Ashford University and the University of the Rockies would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs unless the Department continued to certify the eligibility of the institutions to participate in the Title IV programs. The Department may continue to certify an institution for a period not later than 18 months after the date such recognition ceased. The ineligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Our institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they derive more than 90% of their respective revenues from these programs.Under the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues (calculated in accordance with the Higher Education Act) from Title IV programs for two consecutive fiscal years. This rule is commonly referred to as the “90/10 rule.” Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. In the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Ashford University derived 86.4%, 86.8% and 85.0%, respectively, and the University of the Rockies derived 87.3%, 85.0% and 85.9%, respectively, of their respective revenues (calculated in accordance with applicable Department regulations) from Title IV funds.Recent changes in federal law that increased Title IV grant and loan limits, and any additional increases in the future, may result in an increase in the revenues we receive from Title IV programs, which could make it more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule.Revenue derived from government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is considered not to be federal student aid for purposes of the 90/10 rule calculation, and accordingly helps our institutions satisfy the 90/10 rule. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 22.5% of our institutions' students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive tuition assistance from the government which they may use to pursue postsecondary degrees. If there were a reduction in funding in government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, if revenue derived from such funding were otherwise to decrease significantly, or if there were changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the 90/10 rule calculation, it could be significantly more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule, which could result in our institutions losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.Congress also could propose and adopt legislation that amends the 90/10 rule in ways that make it more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule. For example, in late 2011, the “Ensuring Quality Education for Veterans Act,” was introduced, which proposes to treat government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, as federal student aid for purposes of calculations under the 90/10 rule. Similarly, in January 2012, Sen. Richard Durbin introduced the “Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers Act,” which proposes to have a proprietary institution lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 85% its revenues (calculated in accordance with applicable Department regulations) from federal funds (including Title IV programs, government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, and other sources of federal funds) for one fiscal year; the bill would also make it harder for institutions to use institutional loans (i.e., loans they make themselves to students) to help satisfy the 90/10 rule. Additionally, in February 2012, Sen. Tom Carper introduced the “Military Veterans Education and Protection Act,” which proposes to treat government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, as federal student aid for purposes of calculations under the 90/10 rule. If one or more of these or similar bills were to be enacted and signed into law, it could be significantly more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule (or, potentially, 85/15 rule), which could result in our institutions losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.34Our institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they pay incentive compensation to persons or entities involved in certain recruiting, admissions or financial aid awarding activities.The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution from making any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities involved in student recruiting or admissions activities, or in making decisions about the award of student financial assistance. For more information, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Incentive compensation” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The criteria for compliance with the Department's rules prohibiting incentive compensation are not clear in all circumstances, and the Department does not review or approve compensation plans prior to their implementation.In Finding 1 of the OIG's final audit report related to its compliance audit of Ashford University, the OIG asserted that Ashford University, during the 2006-2007 award year, designed a compensation plan for admissions counselors that provided incentive payments based on success in securing enrollments and did not establish that its plan and practices qualified for certain regulatory safe harbors. To the extent Ashford University cannot establish that its salary adjustments for admissions counselors in the 2006-2007 award year qualified for the regulatory safe harbors, the OIG recommended that the FSA take appropriate action to impose a fine on the university or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's eligibility for Title IV programs. For more information regarding the OIG's final audit report, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Compliance reviews, audits and reports” in Part I, Item 1 of this report.On October 10, 2012, we received a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch (“Justice Department”), informing us that the Justice Department was investigating the compensation of our admissions personnel. In December 2012 and January 2013, we were notified that the Justice Department had declined to intervene in separate qui tam complaints unsealed on December 26, 2012 and January 2, 2013. The qui tam complaints allege, among other things, that our institutions violated the Federal False Claims Act by falsely certifying to the Department that, Ashford University and University of the Rockies, in the case of the qui tam unsealed in 2012, and Ashford University, in the case of the qui tam unsealed in 2013, were in compliance with various regulations regarding the payment of incentive compensation to enrollment personnel in connection with the institutions' participation in student financial aid programs. We are currently evaluating the complaints and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations set forth in the complaints.If one of our institutions were to be determined to have violated the incentive compensation rule, it could be subject to monetary liabilities or to administrative action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Changes in compensation practices for admissions counselors and other covered employees may negatively impact our business and growth prospects.Effective July 1, 2011, the Department eliminated 12 safe harbors which described compensation arrangements not violating the incentive compensation rule, including the payment and adjustment of salaries and bonuses under certain conditions. For more information regarding the elimination of the safe harbors, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Incentive compensation” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Our institutions modified some of their compensation practices as a result of the elimination of the safe harbors. These changes could affect the ability of our institutions to compensate admissions counselors and other covered employees in a manner that appropriately reflects their relative merit, which in turn could (1) reduce employee effectiveness and our ability to attract and retain staff with the desired talent and motivation to succeed and (2) impair our ability to sustain and grow our business, either of which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Our institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if too many students default on their loans.For each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults for each educational institution which is known as a “cohort default rate.” An institution may lose its eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan and Pell programs if, for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years for which information is available, 25% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Program if its cohort default rate exceeds 40% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which default rates have been calculated by the Department. Ashford University's two-year cohort default rates for the 2010, 2009, and 2008 federal fiscal years were 10.2%, 15.3%, and 13.3%, respectively. The two-year cohort default rates for the University of the Rockies for the 2010, 2009, and 2008 federal fiscal years were 4.0%, 3.3%, and 2.5%, respectively. An institution with a cohort default rate that equals or exceeds 25% in any one of the three most recent fiscal years for which rates have been issued by the Department may be placed on provisional certification by the Department.35The August 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act included significant revisions to the requirements concerning cohort default rates. Under the revised law, the period for which students' defaults on their loans are included in the calculation of an institution's cohort default rate was extended by one additional year, which is expected to increase the cohort default rates for most institutions. That change was effective with the calculation of institutions' cohort default rates for the federal fiscal year ending September 30, 2009. The Department will not impose sanctions based on rates calculated under this new methodology until three consecutive years of rates have been calculated, which is expected to occur in 2014. Until that time, the Department will continue to calculate rates under the old calculation method and impose sanctions, if necessary, based on those rates. The revised law also increases the threshold for ending an institution's participation in the relevant Title IV programs from 25% to 30%, effective for final three-year cohort default rates published on or after the 2012 federal fiscal year. The revised law changes the threshold for placement on provisional certification to 30% for two of the three most recent fiscal years for which the Department has published official three-year cohort default rates. Ashford University's and University of the Rockies' three-year cohort default rates for the 2009 cohort were 19.8% and 3.3%, respectively.Loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Our institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if the Department determines they have substantially misrepresented the nature of educational programs, financial charges or graduate employability.The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs, financial charges or graduate employability. Under the Department's rules, a “misrepresentation” is any false, erroneous or misleading statement an institution, one of its representatives, or any ineligible institution, organization, or person with whom the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, or marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services makes directly to a student or prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, to a state agency or the Department. The Department's rules define a “substantial misrepresentation” as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. Considering the broad definition of “substantial misrepresentation,” it is possible that, despite our training efforts and compliance programs, our institutions' employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. If the Department determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the Department may attempt to revoke the institution's program participation agreement, impose limitations on the institution's participation in Title IV programs, deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters, or initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. The loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.The institution could also be exposed to increased risk of additional private actions under the federal False Claims Act. The qui tam complaint that was unsealed on December 26, 2012 alleges, among other things, that Ashford University and University of the Rockies have failed to make required disclosures readily available to students, have misled students as to the true cost of attending the schools, the quality and reputation of their academic programs, and their job placement rates. For more information regarding claims and lawsuits, see the risk factor below entitled “We face litigation and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on enrollments, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations” and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this report.Our institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they fail to correctly calculate and return Title IV program funds timely for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.An institution participating in Title IV programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. For more information, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Failure to make timely returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institution's annual compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years can result in an institution's having to post a letter of credit in an amount equal to 25% of its prior year returns of Title IV program funds. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and returned in a timely manner, an institution is also subject to monetary liabilities or an action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its participation in Title IV programs.In Finding 3 of the OIG's final audit report pertaining to its compliance audit of Ashford University, the OIG asserted that Ashford University, during the 2006-2007 award year, did not in all instances return Title IV funds timely for students who withdrew or went on a leave of absence from school. Accordingly, the OIG recommended that the FSA (1) require Ashford 36University to develop and implement certain remedial policies and procedures and (2) take appropriate action to impose a fine on the university or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's eligibility for Title IV programs. For more information about the OIG's final audit report, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Compliance reviews, audits and reports” in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Our institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they are not legally authorized to operate in the states in which they are physically located.To participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized by the relevant education agency of the state in which it is physically located. See “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-State authorization” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Loss of state authorization by one of our institutions in the state in which it is physically located, or the failure of the state authorization to meet the requirements under the new regulations within the time periods provided by the regulations, would terminate our ability to provide educational services through such institution, as well as make such institution ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Ashford University is physically located in the State of Iowa. The Iowa College Student Aid Commission (“ICSAC”) has advised Ashford University that the institution currently is exempt from any requirement to register with the State of Iowa to offer postsecondary degree programs in Iowa by virtue of its accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission. Ashford University has been placed on Notice by HLC. However, because an institution must be approved or licensed on a basis other than accreditation in instances in which it is not established by name as an educational institution by a state, and it is uncertain how the Department would interpret this rule for Iowa, Ashford University applied for authorization with ICSAC independent of its Higher Learning Commission accreditation in the event that it could be required by the Department; such registration would also be necessary if WASC becomes the institution's primary accreditor. In November 2011, ICSAC determined Ashford University met all requirements to offer postsecondary education in Iowa and approved the institution's registration in Iowa for a four-year period ending November 2015; however, in light of the findings and recommendations contained in the OIG's final audit report, ICSAC stated that it would immediately reconsider the institution's registration for possible revocation if the Department ruled to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's participation in Title IV programs. For more information about the OIG's final audit report, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Compliance reviews, audits and reports” in Part I, Item 1 of this report.On September 22, 2012, ICSAC requested that Ashford University provide the Commission with certain information and documentation related to, among other matters, the denial of Ashford University's application for WASC accreditation, the University's compliance with HLC criteria and policies, a teach-out plan in the event that Ashford University is unsuccessful in obtaining a WASC accreditation and is sanctioned by HLC, and information relating to admissions employees, receipt of financial aid, availability of books, credit balance authorizations, and academic and financial support and advisement services to students. The Commission requested that Ashford University provide the requested information by November 12, 2012 and make an in-person presentation during the Commission's meeting on November 16, 2012. Ashford University made the presentation and the Commission has not requested any additional information.University of the Rockies is located in the State of Colorado and is authorized by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. Such authorization may be lost or withdrawn if the University of the Rockies fails to comply with requirements under Colorado statutes and rules for continued authorization.Our institutions may be required to modify or eliminate certain programs if they do not lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation, as determined by the Department.Under the Higher Education Act, proprietary schools are eligible to participate in Title IV programs only to the extent that their educational programs lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation, with the limited exception of qualified programs leading to a bachelor's degree in liberal arts. In June 2011, the Department published final regulations to establish minimal debt measures for determining whether certain postsecondary educational programs lead to gainful employment in recognized occupations, and the conditions under which such programs are eligible for Title IV funding. The regulations were scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2012. For more information regarding these debt measures and related restrictions on Title IV eligibility, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Gainful employment” in Part I, Item 1 of this report.On June 30, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia nullified most of the gainful employment regulations and returned those regulations to the Department for further action. On July 6, 2012, the Department issued an electronic announcement acknowledging that the Court had vacated the debt measures, that institutions would not be required to comply with related regulations regarding gainful employment reporting requirements and adding new gainful employment educational programs, and that institutions would be required to comply with requirements to disclose certain information 37about gainful employment educational programs. It is unclear how the Department will interpret the decision and its scope. In addition, the Court's decision is subject to post trial motions by the parties and to appeal by the Department and could be modified or reversed as a result of the motions or on appeal. The Department could take further action to address the Court's concerns regarding the regulations and obtain approval to enforce the regulations, or the Department could attempt to issue new gainful employment regulations. We cannot predict what actions the Department will take in response to the Court's decision, when the Department would take those actions, how long those actions would take, or whether those actions will result in reinstated or new regulations, or in new interpretations of existing regulations. If the regulations are reinstated in full or revised, we might need to modify or eliminate some of the educational programs at our institutions, or to provide warnings to current and prospective students, which could negatively impact enrollments, revenue, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.The failure of our institutions to demonstrate financial responsibility may result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or require the posting of a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.To participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must, among other things, satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department or post a letter of credit in favor of the Department and possibly accept other conditions to the institution's participation in Title IV programs. For more information regarding the Department's financial responsibility requirements, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Financial responsibility” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. If our institutions are found not to have satisfied the Department's financial responsibility requirements, they could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.The failure of our institutions to demonstrate administrative capability may result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.Department regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs. For more information regarding the Department's administrative capability standards, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Administrative capability” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. If we are found not to have satisfied the Department's administrative capability requirements, we could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Our institutions must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department prior to seeking recertification.An institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department prior to seeking recertification. The current provisional certification for Ashford University expired on June 30, 2011; however, Department regulations state that if an institution submits a materially complete application for recertification at least 90 days prior to the expiration of its existing certification, then the institution's existing certification will be extended on a month-to-month basis following the expiration of the institution's period of participation until the end of the month in which the Department issues a decision on the application for recertification. Ashford University submitted its electronic application prior to the reapplication deadline of March 31, 2011. The current certification for the University of the Rockies is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2016.The Department may also review our institutions' continued certification to participate in Title IV programs if we undergo a change of control. In addition, the Department may take emergency action to suspend an institution's certification without advance notice if it determines the institution is violating Title IV requirements and determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Title IV funds. The Department also may take adverse action against the Title IV eligibility of a provisionally certified institution under procedures that provide less due process than afforded to other institutions. If the Department did not renew or if it withdrew our institutions' certifications to participate in Title IV programs, their students would no longer be able to receive Title IV funds, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Governmental proceedings or other claims and lawsuits asserting regulatory noncompliance could result in monetary liabilities or penalties, injunctions, or loss of Title IV programs for students at our institutions.Because we operate in a highly regulated industry, we and our institutions are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government under the federal False Claims Act. If the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to defend successfully against such lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions or other penalties. Even 38if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or adversely affect our stock price, even if such claims and lawsuits are eventually determined to be without merit.As discussed in the risk factors above entitled “Our institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they pay incentive compensation to persons or entities involved in certain recruiting, admissions or financial aid awarding activities” and “Our institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if the Department determines they have substantially misrepresented the nature of educational programs, financial charges or graduate employability,” we have been named in two qui tam complaints that allege we and our institutions violated the Federal False Claims Act. Defending a federal False Claims Act lawsuit can be costly and divert management's time and attention from our business, regardless of whether the claim has merit. The adverse resolution of such a lawsuit could lead to monetary liability, including treble damages and attorneys' fees, and other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.For more information regarding the incentive compensation rule, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Incentive compensation” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. For more information regarding claims and lawsuits, see the risk factor below entitled “We face litigation and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on enrollments, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations” and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this report.If we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our business could be adversely impacted.We are susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs. While we believe past incidents of fraudulent activity have been relatively isolated, we cannot be certain that our systems and processes will always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened due to our nature as an online education provider. We must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid.The Department's regulations require institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the OIG credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of the Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. If the systems and processes that we have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, the Department may find that we do not satisfy its “administrative capability” requirements. This could result in our being limited in our access to, or our losing, Title IV program funding, which would adversely affect enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, our institutions' ability to participate in Title IV programs is conditioned on their maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Secretary of Education. Any significant failure to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause them to fail to meet their accrediting agencies' standards. Furthermore, under the Higher Education Act, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions that offer distance learning programs, as our institutions do, must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. Failure to meet applicable accrediting agencies' standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of such accrediting agencies, which could result in a loss of our institutions' eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Our institutions cannot offer new programs, expand their physical operations into certain states or acquire additional schools if such actions are not approved in a timely fashion by the applicable regulatory agencies, and Title IV funds disbursed to students enrolled in any such programs, states or acquired schools may have to be repaid if prior approval is not obtained.Our plans may include our institutions offering new educational programs, some of which may require regulatory approval. In addition, we or our institutions may increase physical operations in additional states or seek to acquire additional schools. If we or our institutions are unable to obtain the necessary approvals for such new programs, operations or acquisitions from the Department, HLC or any applicable state education agency or other accrediting agency, or if we or our institutions are unable to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, the ability to consummate such actions and provide Title IV funds to any affected students would be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our plans. If we or our institutions were to determine erroneously that any such action did not need approval or have all required approvals, our institutions could be liable for repayment of the Title IV program funds provided to students in that program or at that location.39If regulators do not approve or if they delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company, our ability to participate in Title IV programs may be impaired.If we or either of our institutions undergoes a change of control under the standards of applicable state education agencies, HLC or the Department, we must seek the approval of each such regulatory agency. For more information, see “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-Change in ownership resulting in a change of control” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. A failure by us or one of our institutions to reestablish its state authorization, HLC accreditation or Department certification, as applicable, following a change of control could result in a suspension or loss of operating authority or the ability to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Our failure to comply with regulations of various states could preclude us from recruiting or enrolling students in those states or result in such students being ineligible for Title IV financial aid.Various states impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. Several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that offer educational services to students who reside in the state or that advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent between states and are not well developed in many jurisdictions. As such, these requirements are subject to change and in some instances are unclear or are left to the discretion of state employees or agents. Our changing business and the constantly changing regulatory environment require us to regularly evaluate our state regulatory compliance activities. If we are found not to be in compliance and a state seeks to restrict one or more of our business activities within that state, we may not be able to recruit students from that state and may have to cease recruiting or enrolling students in that state. See “Regulation-Department Regulation of Title IV Programs-State authorization” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Our failure to comply with these requirements in one or more states could result in our inability to provide Title IV funds to students in those states.Our regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other postsecondary institutions.In recent years, Congressional, federal, state and accrediting agency investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several postsecondary educational institutions. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with Department regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. Although the media, regulatory and legislative focus has been primarily on the allegations made against these specific companies, broader allegations against the overall postsecondary sector may negatively impact public perceptions of postsecondary educational institutions, including Ashford University and the University of the Rockies. Such allegations could result in increased scrutiny and regulation by the Department, Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures or other governmental authorities on all postsecondary institutions, including ours.Risks Related to Our BusinessOur financial performance depends on our ability to continue to develop awareness among, to recruit and to retain students; adverse publicity may negatively impact demand for our institutions' programs.Building awareness among potential students of Ashford University and University of the Rockies and the programs they offer is critical to their ability to attract prospective students. It is also critical to our success that these prospective students are converted to enrolled students in a cost-effective manner and that these enrolled students remain active in our institutions' programs. Some of the factors that could prevent the successful recruiting and retention of students in their programs include:•the emergence of more and better competitors;•factors related to our marketing efforts, including the costs of Internet advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;•performance problems with our online systems;•our institutions' failure to maintain accreditation and eligibility for Title IV programs;•student dissatisfaction with our institutions' services and programs;•a decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our institutions' programs or programs provided by private sector postsecondary education companies generally;•adverse publicity regarding us or online or private sector postsecondary education generally;40•price reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match; and•a decline in the acceptance of online education or education provided by private sector postsecondary education companies.We face litigation and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on enrollments, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.We and our institutions are subject to lawsuits, investigations and claims covering a wide range of matters. We are the subject of complaints alleging violations of various laws, including but not limited to federal securities laws, including a securities class action, the federal False Claims Act and state employment laws, as well as investigations by state attorneys general in California, Iowa, New York and North Carolina. Derivative shareholder complaints have also been asserted on our behalf against certain of our current and former officers and directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. We could incur significant defense costs related to these or other matters and, in the event of adverse outcomes, monetary losses or restrictions on our business could result, any of which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.For more information regarding current material legal proceedings involving us and our institutions, including investigations by state attorneys general in California, Iowa, New York and North Carolina, see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this report.Our growth may place a strain on our resources.We have experienced significant growth over the last five years. Such historical growth, as well as any further growth that we may experience, may place a significant strain on our resources. Such growth has increased demands on our management information and reporting systems, data analytics, and financial management controls. If we are unable to maintain appropriate internal controls, we may experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs. Additionally, if we and our institutions fail to hire and retain appropriate levels of personnel in critical areas, we could experience increased student complaints, delays in completing critical business projects, system down-time for both internal and student-facing applications, and potential regulatory noncompliance, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects.A failure of our information systems to properly store, process and report relevant data may reduce our management’s effectiveness, interfere with our regulatory compliance and increase our operating expenses.We are heavily dependent on the integrity of our data management systems. If these systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Our institutions rely on a third party vendor for financial aid processing and are responsible for any errors, delays or instances of regulatory noncompliance which may be made by this vendor.Our institutions have engaged Xerox Business Services, LLC (“XBS”), formerly called Affiliated Computer Services, Inc., to provide call center and transactional processing services for their online financial aid student populations, including services related to disbursement eligibility review and Title IV fund returns. Although our institutions monitor the work done by XBS for quality assurance and compliance with Department regulations, our institutions are ultimately responsible for any errors, delays or instances of regulatory noncompliance which may be made by XBS, some of which could potentially affect the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs. Additionally, if XBS ceases to operate or is unwilling or unable to work with our institutions, or if the engagement with XBS is otherwise terminated, our institutions would be required either to handle financial aid processing services using their own resources or to engage another third party vendor, which transition could be economically disadvantageous, present a distraction to management and applicable business units, and increase the risk of errors and regulatory noncompliance during the transition period, any of which could negatively impact our business.Our institutions rely on a third-party vendor to provide the online learning platform for students and related support and hosting.We have a license agreement with Pearson eCollege (“eCollege”) pursuant to which we agreed to license from eCollege an online learning platform for students at our institutions. The eCollege platform provides an online learning management system which provides for the storage, management and delivery of course content. This platform also includes collaborative spaces for student communication and participation with other students and faculty as well as grade and attendance 41management for faculty and assessment capabilities to assist us in maintaining quality. Our institutions rely on eCollege for administrative support and hosting of the applicable systems. If eCollege ceases to operate or is or is unwilling or unable to work with our institutions, or if the license agreement with eCollege and related agreements were otherwise to be terminated, the online learning platform for students at our institutions and related administrative support and hosting could be interrupted or become unavailable, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.We are subject to laws and regulations as a result of our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of such laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of such information, could adversely affect us.Possession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our applicants, students, faculty, staff and their families. We also collect and maintain personal information about our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Our services can be accessed globally through the Internet. Therefore, we may be subject to the application of national privacy laws in countries outside the United States from which applicants and students access our services. Such privacy laws could impose conditions that limit the way we market and provide our services. Our computer networks and the networks of certain of our vendors that hold and manage confidential information on our behalf may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, employee theft or misuse, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security threats. Confidential information may also inadvertently become available to third parties when we integrate systems or migrate data to our servers following an acquisition of a school or in connection with periodic hardware or software upgrades. Due to the sensitive nature of the personal information stored on our servers, our networks may be targeted by hackers seeking to access this data. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate sensitive information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of privacy for current or prospective students or employees. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and could restrict our use of personal information, and a violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information could result in the imposition of fines against us or lawsuits brought against us. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. A major breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our institutions' students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors, or a violation of laws or regulations relating to the same, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, result in lawsuits and could result in further regulation and oversight by federal and state authorities and increased costs of compliance.System disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our technology infrastructure could damage the reputation of our institutions and negatively impact our business.The performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure (including the software and related hosting and maintenance services for our online learning platform, student information system, and lead management system) is critical to our reputation and the ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of systems to us or our institutions' students and negatively impact our business and reputation. Our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other security problems. Although we continually monitor the security of our technology infrastructure and take proactive measures to prevent potential threats, we cannot assure you that these efforts will protect our computer networks against all threats of security breaches, which could damage the reputation of our institutions and negatively impact our business and prospects.Our expenses may cause us to incur operating losses if we do not realize our expected revenues.Our spending is based, in significant part, on our estimates of future revenue and is largely fixed in the short term. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner if our revenue falls short of our expectations. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations would have an immediate and material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, we anticipate increasing operating expenses to expand program offerings, marketing initiatives and administrative organization. Any such expansion could cause material losses to the extent we do not generate additional revenues sufficient to cover those expenses.Strong competition in the postsecondary education market, especially in the online education market, could decrease our market share, increase our cost of recruiting students and put downward pressure on our tuition rates.Postsecondary education is highly competitive. We compete with traditional public and private two- and four-year colleges as well as with other postsecondary schools. Traditional colleges and universities may offer programs similar to those offered by our institutions at lower tuition levels as a result of government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-42deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to for-profit postsecondary institutions. In addition, our institutions face continued scrutiny from their accreditors, and some of our competitors, including both traditional colleges and universities, have substantially greater brand recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students. We also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including traditional colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs.We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business. We may be required to reduce our tuition or increase marketing spending (due to scarcity of quality leads or otherwise) in order to retain or to attract students or to pursue new market opportunities. We may also face increased competition in maintaining and developing new marketing relationships with corporations, particularly as corporations become more selective as to which online universities they will encourage their employees to attend and from which they will hire prospective employees.We may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.Our success depends largely on the skills, efforts and motivations of our executive officers, who generally have significant experience with our company and within the education industry. Due to the nature of our business, we face significant competition in attracting and retaining personnel who possess the skill sets we seek. In addition, key personnel may leave us and may subsequently compete against us. We do not carry life insurance on our key personnel for our benefit. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could impair our ability to sustain and grow our business. In addition, because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our hiring of qualified executives or other personnel may cause us or such persons to be subject to lawsuits alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, improper solicitation of employees or other claims.If we are unable to hire and to continue to develop new and existing employees responsible for student recruitment, the effectiveness of our student recruiting efforts would be adversely affected.We intend to (i) hire, develop and train a significant number of additional employees responsible for student recruitment and (ii) retain and continue to develop and train our current student recruitment personnel. Our ability to develop and maintain a strong student recruiting function may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to integrate and motivate our admissions counselors, our ability to effectively train our admissions counselors, the length of time it takes those new counselors to become productive, regulatory restrictions on the method of compensating admissions counselors and the competition in hiring and retaining them.Enrollment and revenues could decrease if the government tuition assistance offered to military personnel is reduced or eliminated, if scholarships which we offer to military personnel are reduced or eliminated or if our relationships with military bases deteriorate.As of December 31, 2012, approximately 22.5% of our institutions' students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive tuition assistance from the government, which they may use to pursue postsecondary degrees. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 each provide for the possibility of automatic across-the-board reductions in federal spending (also known as “sequestration”) as a budgetary enforcement tool. Sequestration began on March 1, 2013 and it could remain in effect over an extended period. On March 2, 2013, the U.S. Navy announced that tuition assistance would be suspended for new enrollments for U.S. Marines. On March 8, 2013, the U.S. Army announced a suspension of tuition assistance for new enrollments by U.S. Army service members. Additional suspensions may be implemented by other branches of the U.S. military. If tuition assistance suspensions are expanded or maintained over a protracted period, or if governmental tuition assistance programs to active duty members of the military are otherwise reduced or eliminated, or if our relationship with any military base deteriorates, enrollment could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Reductions in tuition assistance could also negatively affect our compliance with the 90/10 rule. See the risk factor above entitled, “Our institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they derive more than 90% of their respective revenues from these programs.” Additionally, we provide scholarships to students who are affiliated with the military. If we reduce or eliminate our scholarships, enrollment by military personnel may suffer. In addition, if we increase our scholarships, our per student revenue from military affiliated personnel will decline.43Enrollment at our institutions declined 5.6% in 2012. A decline in the overall growth of enrollment in postsecondary institutions, or in the number of students seeking degrees online or in our core disciplines, could cause us to experience a further decline in enrollment at our schools.We have experienced overall growth in institutional enrollments and revenues since we acquired Ashford University in 2005. However, while we have continued to achieve growth in revenues year-over-year, enrollment at our institutions declined to 81,810 at December 31, 2012 as compared to 86,642 at December 31, 2011. The growth rate of our revenues has declined in recent periods and may continue to decline in the future. In order to maintain the current growth rate of our revenues and increase enrollment at our institutions, our institutions will need to attract a larger percentage of students in existing markets and expand their markets by creating new academic programs. In addition, if job growth in the fields related to their core disciplines is weaker than expected, fewer students may seek the types of degrees that our institutions offer.Our success depends in part on our institutions' ability to update and expand the content of existing programs and to develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner.The updates and expansions of existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers. If we do not adequately respond to changes in market requirements, our business will be adversely affected. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, our institutions may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our plans. In addition, to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs, a new academic program may need to be approved by the Department.Establishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires investments in management and capital expenditures, additional marketing expenses and reallocation of other resources. We and our institutions may have limited experience with the programs in new disciplines and may need to modify existing systems and strategy or enter into arrangements with other educational institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably. If our institutions are unable to increase enrollment in new programs, offer new programs in a cost-effective manner or are otherwise unable to manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our failure to keep pace with changing market needs could harm our institutions' ability to attract students.Our success depends to a large extent on the willingness of employers to hire, promote or increase the pay of our institutions' graduates. Increasingly, employers demand that their new employees possess appropriate technical and analytical skills and also appropriate interpersonal skills, such as communication and teamwork. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important that our institutions' educational programs evolve in response to those economic and technological changes.The expansion of existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or by the employers of our institutions' graduates. Even if our institutions develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to begin offering those new programs in a timely fashion or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, the rates at which our institutions' graduates obtain jobs in their fields of study could suffer, the ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our business could be adversely affected.We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights sufficiently and we may encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of the intellectual property of third parties.We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. We also own the domain name rights for our institutions, as well as other words and phrases important to our business. Additionally, we have applied for patent protection for certain technology developed by us. We cannot assure you that these measures will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the United States or select foreign jurisdictions or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our technology, curricula, and online resource material, among others. Our management's attention may be diverted by these attempts, and we may need to use funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation.44We may also encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. In certain instances, we may not have obtained sufficient rights in the content of a course. Third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party. Some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to pay monetary damages, which may be significant, or our institutions may be required to alter the content of their classes.We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions.In some instances our institutions' faculty members or students may post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards. We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions. Third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and could impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages.Government regulations relating to the Internet could increase our cost of doing business, affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.The increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services has led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or in foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect enrollments.Failure to comply with the terms of our Credit Agreement with Comerica Bank could impair our rights to the assets we pledged as collateral under this agreement.Through April 12, 2012, we maintained a $50 million revolving line of credit with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) pursuant to a Credit Agreement, Revolving Credit Note and Security Agreement (collectively, the “Prior Loan Documents”). On April 13, 2012, we entered into a $50 million revolving line of credit (“New Facility”) pursuant to an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”) with the lenders signatory thereto and Comerica, as administrative agent for the lenders. The Revolving Credit Agreement amended, restated and superseded the Prior Loan Documents. At our option, we may increase the size of the New Facility up to $100 million (in certain minimum increments), subject to the terms and conditions of the Revolving Credit Agreement. Additionally, we may request swing-line advances under the New Facility up to $3 million in the aggregate.To secure our obligations under the Credit Agreement (and related documents), we granted Comerica a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, including our real property. If an event of default occurs or if we otherwise fail to comply with any of the negative or affirmative covenants of the Credit Agreement (and related documents), including the failure of either of our institutions to maintain Title IV eligibility, Comerica may declare all of the obligations and indebtedness under the Credit Agreement (and related documents) due and payable.For more information about the Credit Agreement and related documents, see Note 11, “Credit Facilities,” to our annual consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this report. In such a scenario, we may lose our right, title and interest in the property that secures such obligations and indebtedness.Our failure to obtain additional capital in the future could adversely affect our ability to grow.We believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our current operating plans for the foreseeable future. However, we may need additional financing in order to finance our plans, particularly if we pursue any acquisitions. The amount, timing and terms of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of new program offerings, the timing and size of acquisitions we may seek to consummate and the amount of cash flows from our operations. To the extent that we require additional financing in the future, such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all and, consequently, we may not be able to fully implement our plans.45A protracted economic slowdown and rising unemployment could harm our business.We believe that many students pursue postsecondary education to be more competitive in the job market. However, a protracted economic slowdown could increase unemployment and diminish job prospects generally. Diminished job prospects and heightened financial worries could affect the willingness of students to incur loans to pay for postsecondary education and to pursue postsecondary education in general. As a result, enrollment could suffer.In addition, many of our institutions' students borrow Title IV loans to pay for tuition, fees and other expenses. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact their ability to repay those loans which would negatively impact our institutions' cohort default rates. Our institutions' students also are frequently able to borrow Title IV loans in excess of their tuition. The excess is received by such students as a stipend. However, if a student withdraws, we must return any unearned Title IV funds including stipends. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact such students' ability to repay those stipends. As a result, the amount of Title IV funds we would have to return without reimbursement from students could increase, and our results could suffer.If we are not able to integrate acquired institutions, our business could be harmed.From time to time, we may pursue acquisitions of other institutions or businesses. Integrating acquired operations into our business involves significant risks and uncertainties, including:•inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;•distraction of management's attention from normal business operations during the integration process;•inability to obtain, or delay in obtaining, approval of the acquisition from the necessary regulatory agencies, or the imposition of operating restrictions or a letter of credit requirement on us or on the acquired school by any of those regulatory agencies;•expenses associated with the integration efforts; and•unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including legal contingencies.An increase in interest rates could adversely affect our institutions' ability to attract and retain students.Interest rates have reached relatively low levels in recent years, creating a favorable borrowing environment for students. However, if Congress increases interest rates on Title IV loans, or if private loan interest rates rise, our institutions' students would have to pay higher interest rates on their loans. Any future increase in interest rates will result in a corresponding increase in educational costs to existing and prospective students. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to students' repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact our institutions' eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollment, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.We face risk in connection with institutional loan programs implemented at our academic institutions. If students participating in such programs fail to repay their loans timely, our business will be negatively impacted.Both Ashford University and University of the Rockies have institutional loan programs for their online student population. At December 31, 2012, there was $15.1 million, net, outstanding in institutional loans. Under these programs, our institutions loan money directly to eligible and qualifying students. If students participating in these programs fail to repay their loans timely, it could have a negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.We may not earn enough revenue from Constellation, Thuze, Waypoint Outcomes and our other technologies to offset the costs of innovating, developing, deploying and marketing these technologies.In recent periods, we have devoted increasing amounts of resources to innovating, developing and marketing new technologies such as Constellation, Thuze, Waypoint Outcomes, and the mobile application technology for our institutions. If we are unable to earn revenue sufficient to offset the costs of innovating, developing and marketing such technologies, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations governing our activities could result in financial penalties and other costs.We use hazardous materials at our ground campuses and generate small quantities of waste, such as used oil, antifreeze, paint, car batteries and laboratory materials. Additionally, we purchased real property nearby our Ashford University campus in Clinton, Iowa, for purposes of future campus expansion and student housing at which we have identified minor environmental 46issues. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste and the clean-up of contamination at our facilities or off-site locations to which we send or have sent waste for disposal. If we do not maintain compliance with any of these laws and regulations, or are responsible for a spill or release of hazardous materials, we could incur significant costs for clean-up, damages and fines or penalties.Our corporate headquarters are located in a high brush fire danger area and near major earthquake fault lines.Our corporate headquarters are located in San Diego, California in a high brush fire danger area and near major earthquake fault lines. We could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a brush fire or major earthquake, either of which could significantly disrupt our business.We have a limited operating history. Accordingly, our historical and recent financial and business results may not necessarily be representative of what such results will be in the future.We have a limited operating history on which you can evaluate our business strategy, our financial results and trends in our business. As a result, our historical results and trends, including bad debt expense and our institutions' enrollments and cohort default rates, may not be indicative of future results.Risk Related to Our Common StockThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past (in 2012, our common stock traded at a low of $8.11 per share and at a high of $27.26 per share), and there is no assurance it will not continue to fluctuate significantly for a variety of different reasons, including, without limitation:•developments regarding the accreditation of our academic institutions, particularly Ashford University, which has been placed on Notice;•our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;•public reaction to our press releases, corporate communications and SEC filings;•changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of other companies in our industry;•seasonal variations in our student enrollment;•new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our industry or business;•negative publicity, including government hearings and other public lawmaker or regulator criticism, regarding our industry or business;•changes in enrollment;•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;•litigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors;•sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders; and•changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. Changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company.47Sales of outstanding shares of our stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.If our stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. At December 31, 2012, 54.1 million shares of our common stock were outstanding.In July 2011, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register the resale of 34.6 million shares of our common stock held by our majority stockholder, Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII, L.P. (“Warburg Pincus”). Under the registration statement, which the SEC has declared effective, Warburg Pincus, and its permitted transferees or other successors-in-interest, may offer the shares from time to time through public or private transactions at prevailing market prices, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at privately negotiated prices. If these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our stock could decline.In addition, as of December 31, 2012, there were 6.4 million shares underlying outstanding options, 0.4 million shares underlying restricted stock units and 0.1 million shares underlying outstanding warrants. All shares subject to outstanding options and warrants are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various option and warrant agreements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our stock could decline. Under Rule 144, shares held by non-affiliates for more than six months may generally be sold without restriction, other than a current public information requirement, and may be sold freely without any restrictions after one year. Shares held by affiliates may also be sold under Rule 144, subject to applicable restrictions, including volume and manner of sale limitations.If securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.Our principal stockholder has significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval and access to our management.As of December 31, 2012, Warburg Pincus beneficially owned 63.9% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Warburg Pincus may exercise significant influence over the election of our directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders, including mergers, going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions. The ownership position of Warburg Pincus may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or a change in the composition of our board of directors.In February 2009, we entered into a nominating agreement with Warburg Pincus. Under the nominating agreement, as long as Warburg Pincus beneficially owns at least 15% of the outstanding shares of common stock, we will, subject to our fiduciary obligations, nominate and recommend to our stockholders that two individuals designated by Warburg Pincus be elected to our board of directors. Additionally, if Warburg Pincus beneficially owns less than 15% but more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock, we will, subject to our fiduciary obligations, nominate and recommend to our stockholders that one individual designated by Warburg Pincus be elected to our board of directors. Two directors affiliated with Warburg Pincus, Patrick T. Hackett and Adarsh Sarma, currently serve on our board of directors.We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.We do not expect to pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future and we intend to use our cash position to grow our business. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates.Your percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.Subject to NYSE rules, our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock. At December 31, 2012, 300.0 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, 54.1 million shares of which were outstanding. At 48December 31, 2012, 20.0 million shares of preferred stock were authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, no shares of which were outstanding. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, likely would result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:•authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;•provide for a classified board of directors (three classes);•provide that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;•provide that any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;•provide that a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our board of directors or by our chief executive officer;•provide that action by written consent of the stockholders may be taken only if the board of directors first approves such action, except that if Warburg Pincus holds at least 50% of our outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis, whenever the vote of stockholders is required at a meeting for any corporate action, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with, and the action taken without such meeting and vote, if a written consent is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at the meeting of stockholders; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, we will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with NYSE rules, for so long as our shares are listed on the NYSE, and as otherwise required by the bylaws;•provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.Additionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder.Item 1B.
