(2)Acquisition made by Comstar. (3)In December 2009, in a series of transactions, we acquired an additional 14.2% stake in MGTS in exchange for 31,816,462 ordinary MTS shares and $7.3 million in cash. The MGTS stake was held by a wholly owned subsidiary of Comstar. Simultaneously, we received shares representing 11.06% of the total shares outstanding Comstar from MGTS Finance S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of MGTS. We paid Comstar cash consideration of $8.3 million. As a result of these transactions, our ownership stake in Comstar increased to 61.97% (or 64.03% excluding treasury shares) as of December 31, 2009. We further increased our ownership stake in Comstar to 70.97% (or 73.33% excluding treasury shares) in September 2010 through a voluntary tender offer. See Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements. (4)In June 2010, we increased our direct ownership in TS-Retail OJSC from 25% to 40% for a nominal sum of $1. We subsequently increased our effective ownership interest in TS-Retail to 50.95%, which was achieved through a voluntary tender offer to purchase Comstar's shares in September 2010. In December 2010, as a result of the acquisition of Sistema Telecom, we acquired an additional 45% stake in TS-Retail, thereby increasing our effective ownership interest to 96.0%. In 2011, as a result of our merger with Comstar, we increased our ownership interest in TS-Retail to 100%. Results of Operations Historically, we reflected our reportable segments on a geographical basis. Management has taken this approach as this is effectively how the business is managed. In 2009, starting from the date of acquisition of Comstar, our Board and management determined a new operating segment and identified three reportable segments: Russia mobile, Russia fixed and Ukraine mobile. See "Segments." Historically, we included all headquarters expenses within the "Russia" reportable segment. Starting from 2009, headquarters expenses are no longer allocated to any reportable segments. The financial statements reflect these changes for the year 2009 and for comparative periods. See Note 31 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information. Intercompany eliminations presented below consist primarily of sales transactions between segments conducted in the normal course of operations. 146 Table of Contents Financial information by reportable segments is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 (in thousands of U.S. dollars) Net operating revenues Russia mobile $ 7,916,658 $ 6,670,127 $ 7,789,463 Russia fixed 1,784,455 1,498,223 1,748,899 Ukraine mobile 1,661,951 1,048,751 1,072,830 Other 779,520 787,543 864,372 Eliminations(1) (149,961 ) (137,390 ) (182,328 ) Net operating revenues as reported $ 11,992,623 $ 9,867,253 $ 11,293,236 Costs of services, excluding depreciation and amortization shown separately below, and cost of handsets and accessories Russia mobile $ 1,869,620 $ 1,733,757 $ 2,331,072 Russia fixed 313,583 283,503 349,685 Ukraine mobile 511,502 332,807 313,742 Other 131,497 156,793 156,617 Eliminations(1) (144,233 ) (120,085 ) (162,546 ) Cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories as reported $ 2,681,969 $ 2,386,775 $ 2,988,570 Sundry operating expenses(2) Russia mobile $ 1,317,140 $ 1,336,152 $ 1,422,058 Russia fixed 759,066 569,599 634,963 Ukraine mobile 200,908 151,061 178,536 Other 351,868 303,460 494,989 Eliminations (7,476 ) (8,337 ) (11,519 ) Sundry operating expenses as reported $ 2,621,506 $ 2,351,935 $ 2,719,027 Sales and marketing expenses Russia mobile $ 615,151 $ 542,745 $ 650,775 Russia fixed 48,764 40,568 56,412 Ukraine mobile 190,225 92,598 81,925 Other 64,210 58,451 69,971 Eliminations (9,526 ) (5,879 ) (8,499 ) Sales and marketing expenses as reported $ 908,824 $ 728,483 $ 850,584 Depreciation and amortization expenses Russia mobile $ 1,313,970 $ 1,111,877 $ 1,196,162 Russia fixed 214,676 193,679 222,565 Ukraine mobile 437,988 352,037 354,154 Other 186,443 186,581 227,615 Depreciation and amortization as reported $ 2,153,077 $ 1,844,174 $ 2,000,496 Operating Income Russia mobile $ 2,800,777 $ 1,945,596 $ 2,189,396 Russia fixed 448,366 410,874 485,273 Ukraine 321,328 120,248 144,473 Other 45,503 82,257 (84,820 ) Eliminations 11,273 (3,089 ) 236 Operating income as reported $ 3,627,246 $ 2,555,886 $ 2,734,559 (1)Represents the elimination of inter-company transaction results, primarily interconnect and roaming arrangements.

In functional currency terms, our consolidated revenues increased in all countries in which we operate, other than in Armenia, in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to increased usage of value-added services, increased traffic on our mobile networks and as a result of the expansion of our retail business in Russia. Our consolidated mobile subscriber base grew by 5.7% to approximately 103.35 million as of December 31, 2010, from approximately 97.8 million as of December 31, 2009. The growth in our subscriber base was mainly attributable to our sales and marketing efforts and the expansion of our network. In Armenia, our consolidated revenues decreased in functional currency terms mainly due to the highly competitive environment in Armenia. Consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 25.2% to $2,988.6 million from $2,386.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In functional currency terms, our consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories increased in all countries in which we operate, other than in Armenia, largely due to the same factors described above that caused our consolidated revenues to increase in functional currency terms. Our consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories as a percentage of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to 26.5% as compared to 24.2% in the year ended December 31, 2009, mainly due to the expansion of our retail operations, which generally have lower margins than our communications service operations. Russia mobile revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 16.8% to $7,789.5 million from $6,670.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in Russia mobile revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to the growth of roaming revenues, revenues from value-added services and sales of handsets and accessories. Roaming revenues increased by 20.0% in the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the growth of roaming activity as a result of an economic recovery and increase in number of subscribers by 3.1% to 71.4 million as of December 31, 2010, from 69.3 million as of December 31, 2009. Revenues from value-added services as a percentage of Russia mobile revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, grew to 17.3% as compared to 16.3% in the year ended December 31, 2009, due to the introduction of new marketing initiatives aimed at stimulating greater usage of value-added services among our subscribers. Our continued expansion of our monobrand retail chain in 2010 caused sales of handsets and accessories to increase as a percentage of Russia mobile revenues to 9.0% in the year ended December 31, 2010, from 5.2% in the year ended December 31, 2009. Russia mobile cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 34.5% to $2,331.1 million from $1,733.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The growth was primarily due to the increase in the number of subscribers, traffic volume and cost of handsets and accessories. Interconnect expenses increased to $978.5 million or 12.6% of Russia mobile revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, from $789.4 million or 11.8% of Russia mobile revenues in the year ended December 31, 2009, mainly due to the growth in outgoing network traffic. Cost of handsets, accessories sold and SIM-cards provided to customers as a percentage of Russia mobile revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to 8.8% as compared to 4.8% in the year ended December 31, 2009, mainly due to the continued expansion of our retail business in 2010. Russia fixed revenues increased by 16.7% to $1,749.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, from $1,498.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily caused by continued growth in domestic and international long distance and calling party pays traffic volumes, 148 Table of Contents growth in the broadband Internet business and a regulatory price increase for residential and corporate voice services. Russia fixed cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories increased by 23.3% to $349.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, from $283.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. This was largely due to the growth of interconnect expenses due to the increase in traffic volume, rise in utility and energy costs due to the increase in state regulated tariffs. Ukraine mobile revenues increased by 2.3% to $1,072.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, from $1,048.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to growth in the number of our subscribers by 3.6% to 18.2 million from 17.6 million. Ukraine mobile cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories decreased by 5.7% to $313.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, from $332.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The decline occurred primarily due to a decrease in interconnect expenses by $30.2 million to $163.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 from $193.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, and to 15.2% from 18.4%, respectively, as a percentage of Ukraine mobile revenues. The decrease in interconnect expenses resulted from a reduction of interconnect rates with Kyivstar, which was partially offset by an increase in the cost of providing value-added services to 3.5% from 2.8% of total Ukraine mobile revenues. Other countries revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 9.8% to $864.4 million from $787.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In functional currency terms, the increase in revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009 was approximately 19.8% in Uzbekistan and 29.1% in Turkmenistan.

Our subscriber base grew by 23.7% in Uzbekistan during the year ended December 31, 2010, and our revenues generally increased in line with this growth. Our subscriber base in Armenia grew by 18.7% during 2010 as compared to 2009 which was diluted by a decrease in tariffs as a response to our competitors' actions in Armenia. Other countries cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2010, remained stable as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, and equaled $156.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and $156.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a percentage of other countries total revenues, these costs decreased to 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 19.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to effective cost control. Sundry operating expenses Consolidated sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 15.6% to $2,719.0 million from $2,351.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $367.1 million in sundry operating expenses was attributable in part to the acquisition of Multiregion, the impairment of our business in Turkmenistan, as well as the appreciation of the functional currencies in countries in which we operate against the U.S. dollar. Sundry operating expenses as a percentage of our total revenues increased to 24.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010, from 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was mainly attributable to growth in salary expenses and related social contributions as well as rent expense due to the expansion of our retail network and a corresponding increase in employees.

Rent expenses as a percentage of our total revenues grew to 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was also attributable to the increase in loss from impairment as a percentage of our total revenues to 1.1% for the year ended 149 Table of Contents December 31, 2010, from 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009, due to the impairment of long-lived assets in Turkmenistan.

Russia mobile sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia mobile revenues decreased to 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 20.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease of Russia mobile sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia mobile revenues was attributable to a decrease in impairment of long-lived assets and the release of tax reserves, except for the income tax reserves, relating to our retail business. Russia fixed sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 11.5% to $635.0 million from $569.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Russia fixed sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia fixed revenues decreased to 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 38.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $65.4 million was mainly attributable to the acquisition of Multiregion, as well as the increase in consulting expenses paid in connection with the sale of our stake in Svyazinvest. The decrease of Russia fixed sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Russia fixed-line revenues was primarily caused by the reduction in the number of top managers in connection with the merger of MTS and Comstar, cost-reduction programs across the entire Russia fixed segment and improvements in operational efficiencies in the regions through the integration of our regional pay-TV operations. Ukraine mobile sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 18.2% to $178.5 million from $151.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Ukraine mobile sundry operating expenses as a percentage of Ukraine mobile revenues increased to 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 14.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Other countries sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 63.1% to $495.0 million from $304.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Other countries sundry operating expenses as a percentage of other countries total revenues increased to 57.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to the impairment of long-lived assets in Turkmenistan. Sales and marketing expenses Consolidated sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 16.8%, or $122.1 million, to $850.6 million from $728.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was mainly due to the increase in commissions payable to dealers as a result of an overall increase in the commission rates. Advertising and promotion expenses decreased, which was primarily attributable to our cost optimization efforts. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our total revenues remained stable at 7.5% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Russia mobile sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $650.8 million, or 8.4% of Russia mobile revenue, from $542.7 million, or 8.1% of Russia mobile revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in sales and marketing expenses by 19.9% was due to appreciation of the ruble and an increase of dealer commission rates. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of advertising and marketing expenses. Dealer commissions as a percentage of Russia mobile revenues increased to 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Advertising and marketing expenses as a percentage of Russia mobile revenues decreased to 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 3.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. 150 Table of Contents Russia fixed sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $56.4 million, or 3.2% of Russia fixed revenues, from $40.6 million, or 2.7% of Russia fixed revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in sales and marketing expenses by $15.8 million and as a percentage of Russia fixed revenues was primarily caused by the extension of marketing and advertising campaigns in 2010 and an increase in dealer commissions in connection with the transfer of MGTS subscribers to Comstar DLD/ILD services. Ukraine mobile sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, decreased to $81.9 million, or 7.6% of Ukraine mobile revenues, from $92.6 million, or 8.8% of Ukraine mobile revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses by $10.7 million and as a percentage of Ukraine mobile revenues was primarily due to the reduction of dealer commissions as a result of a decrease in revenue sharing rates. Other countries sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 19.7% to $70.0 million from $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a percentage of other countries total revenues, other countries sales and marketing expenses increased to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was mainly attributable to growth in expenses related to the MTS Bonus loyalty program. Depreciation and amortization expenses Consolidated depreciation and amortization of property, network equipment, telephone numbering capacity, license costs and other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 8.5% to $2,000.5 million from $1,844.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was due to our increased asset base resulting from the continued expansion of our network through build-outs, as well as due to accelerated depreciation of certain equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of our total revenues decreased to 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 18.7% for the year ended December 31, 2009, due to reasons described below. Russia mobile depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 7.6% to $1,196.2 million from $1,111.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 mainly as a result of the build-out of our 3G networks. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of Russia mobile revenues decreased to 15.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 16.7% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was mainly due to the fact that a substantial portion of Russia mobile capital expenditure took place in December 2010, such that the recognition of depreciation and amortization expense for the newly acquired assets started only at the end of 2010. Russia fixed depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $222.6 million, or 12.7% of Russia fixed revenues, and $193.7 million, or 12.9% of Russia fixed revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The growth in Russia fixed depreciation and amortization expense by $28.9 million was mainly due to the continued build-out and selective modernization of our network in Moscow, as well as the completion of the build-out of our proprietary long-distance network. Ukraine mobile depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $354.2 million, or 33.0% of Ukraine mobile revenues, and $352.0 million, or 33.6% of Ukraine mobile revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense as percentage of Ukraine mobile revenues decreased as our 2009 revenues were affected by the global economic crisis. Other countries depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 22.0% to $227.6 million from $186.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, and increased as a percentage of other countries total revenues to 26.3% from 23.8%. Growth in other countries 151 Table of Contents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of other countries total revenues was primarily attributable to our operations in Uzbekistan, where we continued expansion of our network. Operating Income Consolidated operating income increased by 7.0% to $2,734.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $2,555.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating income as a percentage of our total revenues decreased to 24.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 25.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease of operating income by $178.7 million was mainly due to the impairment of our assets in Turkmenistan combined with the other factors described above. The decrease in the operating income margin was due to an increase in salaries and social contributions, rent expenses, dealer commissions, provision for obsolescence and impairment of long-lived assets as a percentage of our total revenues. Russia mobile operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 12.5% to $2,189.4 million from $1,945.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Russia mobile operating income decreased as a percentage of Russia mobile revenues to 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 29.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009, mainly due to the expansion of our retail network, which resulted in an increase in salaries and social contributions, rent, provision for obsolescence, accelerated by historically lower margins on sales of handsets and accessories. This decrease was offset by a decrease in impairment of long-lived assets, the release of a VAT provision relating to our retail business and depreciation and amortization expenses. The decrease in Russia mobile operating income margin was also attributable to higher sales and marketing costs. In addition, our operating income was affected by the appreciation of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar. Russia fixed operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 18.1% to $485.3 million from $410.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in Russia fixed operating income as a percentage of Russia fixed revenues to 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 27.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009, was mainly due to the reduction in headcount, salaries and social contributions in connection with the forthcoming merger of MTS and Comstar. Ukraine mobile operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 20.1% to $144.5 million from $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Ukraine mobile operating income increased as a percentage of Ukraine mobile revenues to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010, from 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. These increases were largely due to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses, as well as interconnect expenses due to a decrease in interconnect rates with Kyivstar. Other countries operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $84.8 million. The loss resulted from impairment of our assets in Turkmenistan. The effect of the impairment on the operating results of other countries total revenues amounted to $137.8 million. Currency exchange and transaction gains/losses Consolidated currency exchange and transaction gains for the year ended December 31, 2010, were $20.2 million, compared to losses of $252.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. We conduct our operations within the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia, and we are therefore subject to currency fluctuations. The local currencies of these countries fluctuated significantly against the U.S. dollar and euro during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the currency exchange and transaction gains we incurred were primarily due to the translation effect of our U.S. dollar and euro-denominated debt as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The gains recognized in 2010 as compared to losses recorded in 2009 were mainly due to the appreciation of the Russian ruble 152 Table of Contents and the Armenian dram against the U.S. dollar and euro during the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009. Interest expense Consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $205.4 million, or 35.9% to $777.3 million from $571.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In 2010, we voluntarily repaid approximately $1.4 billion of our debt balance outstanding as of December 31, 2009 before the due date, and this resulted in an immediate write-off of the related debt issuance cost in a total amount of $24.3 million. During 2010, we renegotiated the interest rates and maturities of several credit facilities, which led to a significant modification of the related debt agreements and the consequent write-off of capitalized issuance costs totaling $26.4 million. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. The remaining increase is due to the increase in our average balance of indebtedness in 2010. Impairment of investments There was no consolidated impairment of investments loss in the year ended December 31, 2010. The consolidated impairment of investments loss for the year ended December 31, 2009, included write offs of investments in Svyazinvest and Tammaron Ltd., as described in Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements, respectively. Equity in net income of associates Consolidated equity in net income of associates for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $10.3 million, or 17.1% to a gain of $70.6 million, compared to a gain of $60.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Consolidated equity in net income of associates for the year ended December 31, 2009, was affected by a write-off of our investment in Coral/Sistema Strategic Fund as described in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Other expenses (income), net Consolidated other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $66.9 million, as compared to $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to accrued damages plus interest relating to the dispute with Nomihold. Provision for income taxes Consolidated provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by 2.4% to $517.2 million from $505.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rate decreased to 25.0% in the year ended December 31, 2010, from 33.7% in the year ended December 31, 2009. The high effective tax rate in 2009 was caused by the changes in the valuation allowance against tax loss carry-forwards of MGTS Finance S.A. and valuation of investment in Svyazinvest, recognition of deferred tax liability related to potential earnings distributions from/to our subsidiaries, effect of treasury stock disposal by Comstar, and other nondeductible items which took place in 2009. Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2010, amounted to $167.8 million compared to $20.1 million loss in income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income loss attributable to the non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2009, was the result of a decrease in the net income of Comstar due to the impairment of its investment in Svyazinvest, as well as the foreign exchange and transactions losses incurred on the note payable to Access. 153 Table of Contents Net income attributable to the Group Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $366.4 million, or 36.1%, to $1,380.6 million, compared to $1,014.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 12.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010, and 10.3% in the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, increased mainly due to currency exchange rates and transaction gains resulting from appreciation of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar and euro, and a decrease in write-offs of investments. Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenues and cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $2,125.3 million, or 17.7%, to $9,867.3 million from $11,992.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our consolidated revenues decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of the depreciation of the functional currencies in our countries of operation against the U.S. dollar. In functional currency terms, our consolidated revenues increased in all countries in which we operate, other than in Ukraine, in 2009 compared to 2008 mainly due to increased usage of value-added services, increased traffic on our mobile networks and as a result of the expansion of our retail business in Russia. Our consolidated mobile subscriber base grew by 7.1% to approximately 97.8 million as of December 31, 2009 from approximately 91.33 million as of December 31, 2008. The growth in our subscriber base was mainly attributable to our sales and marketing efforts and the expansion of our network. In Ukraine, our consolidated revenues decreased in functional currency terms mainly due to the highly competitive environment in Ukraine and decreased consumer spending caused by the economic downturn. Consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 11.0% to $2,386.8 million from $2,682.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in costs in U.S. dollar terms was primarily attributable to the depreciation of the functional currencies in our countries of operation. In functional currency terms, our consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories increased in all countries in which we operate, other than in Ukraine, largely due to the same factors described above that caused our consolidated revenues to increase in functional currency terms. Our consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories as a percentage of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to 24.2% as compared to 22.4% in the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly due to the expansion of our retail operations, which generally have lower margins than our communications service operations. Russia mobile revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 15.7% to $6,670.1 million from $7,916.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in Russia revenues was primarily due to the depreciation of the ruble, which is our functional currency in Russia. In ruble terms, our mobile revenues in Russia increased by approximately 8% in 2009 compared to 2008. Despite the growth of our subscriber base in Russia, which increased by 7.3% to 69.3 million as of December 31, 2009, from 64.6 million as of December 31, 2008, we experienced a decrease in airtime revenue to 41.1%, if expressed as a percentage of total segment revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 45.8% in the year ended December 31, 2008, mainly due to a decrease in the usage of higher-value services by corporate subscribers caused by the economic downturn. Conversely, revenues from value-added services as a percentage of total segment revenues in the year ended December 31, 2009, grew to 16.3% as compared to 13.6% in the year ended December 31, 2008, due to the introduction of new marketing initiatives aimed at stimulating greater usage of value-added services among our subscribers. Interconnect revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues in the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased to 12.2% as compared to 12.7% in the year ended December 31, 2008, mainly due to the increased proportion of sales of handsets and 154 Table of Contents accessories revenues as a percentage of our total revenues as described below. In absolute terms, if expressed in functional currency, interconnect revenues increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our acquisition of retail chains in 2009 caused sales of handsets and accessories to increase as a percentage of total segment revenues to 5.2% in the year ended December 31, 2009 from 1.7% in the year ended December 31, 2008. Russia mobile cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 7.3% to $1,733.8 million from $1,869.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily caused by the significant depreciation of the ruble. In ruble terms, Russia mobile cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories increased mainly due to an increase in the provision of value-added services, cost of handsets, accessories and SIM-cards. The increase in ruble terms was slightly offset by a decrease in interconnect and roaming expenses. The cost of value-added services increased to 3.5% as a percentage of segment total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2.5% in the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly due to the increased usage of value-added services by subscribers, which resulted from our marketing efforts and the rising awareness and popularity of certain value-added services. Interconnect expenses decreased to 11.8% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2009 from 13.2% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly due to the increased share of cost of handsets and accessories in the total cost of services and products and savings gained from the construction of our own DLD/ILD network. Roaming expenses decreased to 2.4% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2009 from 2.8% of segment total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly due to the lower usage of roaming services caused by the economic downturn. Cost of handsets, accessories sold and SIM-cards provided to customers as a percentage of total segment revenues in the year ended December 31, 2009, increased to 4.8% as compared to 2.1% in the year ended December 31, 2008, mainly due to the expansion of our retail business in 2009. Russia fixed revenues decreased by 16.0% to $1,498.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 from $1,784.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily caused by the significant depreciation of the ruble and a decrease in the consumption of fixed telecommunications services by corporate subscribers and operators due to the economic downturn. This decline was partially offset by the increase in regional broadband Internet revenue due to our efforts to up-sell our existing pay-TV subscribers to Internet services, an increase in regulated tariffs in Moscow and an increase in revenue from long-distance services following the launch of our proprietary long-distance network. Russia fixed cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories decreased by 9.6% to $283.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 from $313.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily caused by the significant depreciation of the ruble, which was offset by an increase in interconnect expenses due to the increase in the volume of long-distance traffic. Ukraine mobile revenues decreased by 36.9% to $1,048.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1,662.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to depreciation of the hryvnia, our functional currency in Ukraine, against the U.S. dollar. In hryvnia terms, Ukraine mobile revenues decreased by approximately 5% due to a decrease in usage and subscription fees, which was partially offset by an increase in the usage of value-added services and roaming from guest subscribers. The overall decrease in Ukraine mobile revenues was caused by the highly competitive environment in Ukraine, which has put significant pressure on tariff levels and led to a decline in our subscriber base in Ukraine during 2007, 2008 and 2009. Ukraine mobile cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories decreased by 34.9% to $332.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, from $511.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. The decline occurred primarily due to the depreciation of the hryvnia. However, Ukraine mobile cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories as a percentage of segment total 155 Table of Contents revenues increased to 31.7% in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 30.8% in the year ended December 31, 2008 due to an increase in roaming expenses from 2.9% to 3.5% and other direct costs from 2.8% to 3.8% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively due to an increase in roaming usage and higher costs for electricity and frequencies. Interconnect expenses decreased to 18.4% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2009 from 19.7% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2008, mainly due to the decline in outgoing network traffic. Cost of handsets, accessories and SIM-cards remained relatively stable at 3.1% of segment total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 3.0% of segment total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2008. Other countries revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 1.0% to $787.5 million from $779.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. In functional currency terms, the increase in revenues in 2009 as compared to 2008 was approximately 2% in Armenia, 3% in Uzbekistan and 60% in Turkmenistan. Our subscriber base in Turkmenistan increased by 89.5% during the year ended December 31, 2009, which led to increased traffic volume. Our subscriber base grew by 25.3% in Uzbekistan, which was diluted by decreased tariffs and an increase in the usage of lower-value tariffs and services in Uzbekistan. Our subscriber base in Armenia grew by 2.8% during 2009 as compared to 2008, and its revenues generally increased in line with this growth. Other countries cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased by 18.6% to $155.9 million from $131.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a percentage of segment total revenues, these costs increased to 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 16.9% for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to an increase in interconnect expenses, particularly in Uzbekistan. Sundry operating expenses Consolidated sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased by 10.3% to $2,351.9 million from $2,621.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease of $269.6 million in sundry operating expenses was primarily attributable to the depreciation of the functional currencies in our countries of operation against the U.S. dollar. However, we experienced an increase in sundry operating expenses both as expressed in functional currencies and as a percentage of our total revenues. Sundry operating expenses as a percentage of our total revenues increased to 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2009 from 21.9% in the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was mainly attributable to growth in salary expenses and related social contributions due to the expansion of our retail network and resultant increase in employees. Salary expense and related social contributions as a percentage of our total revenues grew to 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Similarly, our rent expenses increased due to our retail network expansion. Rent expenses as a percentage of our total revenues grew to 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009, from 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was also attributable to the increase in loss from impairment as a percentage of our total revenues to 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 0.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, due to the impairment of long-lived assets and write off of certain costs related to our acquisition of Comstar. Russia mobile sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased by 1.4% to $1,336.2 million from $1,317.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Russia sundry operating expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues increased to 20.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009, from 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase of Russia mobile sundry operating expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues was attributable to an increase in employee compensation and related social contributions due to the expansion of our retail network, which caused an increase in rent costs. The increase was also attributable to the impairment of long-lived assets. The overall increase was slightly offset by a decrease in the provision for bad debt due to the one-time write-off taken in 2008 of a loan extended to Beta Link. 156 Table of Contents Russia fixed sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased by 25.0% to $569.6 million from $759.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Russia fixed sundry operating expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues decreased to 38.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009, from 42.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease of $189.5 million in absolute terms was mainly attributable to the depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar in 2009. The decrease of Russia fixed sundry operating expenses as a percentage of our total revenues was primarily caused by a reduction in the number of employees at MGTS and in the regions, cost-reduction programs across the entire Russia fixed segment, and improvement in efficiencies of operations in the regions of Russia due to the integration of the regional pay-TV operations. Ukraine mobile sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased by 24.8% to $151.1 million from $200.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Ukraine mobile sundry operating expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues increased to 14.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009, from 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008. These expenses increased in functional currency terms in the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to inflation-driven increases in rent, repair and maintenance and consulting expenses. Additionally, bad debt provision and billing and data processing expenses increased due to write offs of certain outstanding dealer receivables and certain expenses incurred in connection with the implementation of a new billing system, respectively. Other countries sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased by 13.8% to $303.5 million from $351.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Other countries sundry operating expenses as a percentage of other countries total revenues decreased to 38.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009, from 45.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in other countries sundry operating expenses as a percentage of other countries total revenues was primarily attributable to the decrease in salaries and social contributions and general and administrative costs achieved by effective optimization of these costs. Sales and marketing expenses Consolidated sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased by 19.8%, or $180.3 million, to $728.5 million from $908.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decline was mainly due to the depreciation of the functional currencies in our countries of operation against the U.S. dollar, as well a decline in sales and marketing expenses in functional currency terms in all of our countries of operation other than Russia. In general, commissions payable to dealers increased in line with our increased efforts aimed at stimulating the performance and sales of dealers. Advertising and promotion expenses decreased, which was primarily attributable to our cost optimization efforts. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our total revenues remained relatively stable at 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Russia mobile sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased by 11.8% to $542.7 million from $615.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, due to depreciation of the ruble.

As a percentage of segment total revenues, other countries sales and marketing expenses decreased to 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 8.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008. We experienced a decrease in both reporting and functional currency terms mainly due to effective use of our marketing resources. Depreciation and amortization expenses Consolidated depreciation and amortization of property, network equipment, telephone numbering capacity, license costs and other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased by 14.3% to $1,844.2 million from $2,153.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in U.S. dollar terms was mainly attributable to the depreciation of our functional currencies; however, these expenses increased in functional currency terms due to our increased asset base resulting from the continued expansion of our network through build-outs, as well as due to accelerated depreciation of certain equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of our total revenues increased to 18.7% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2008, due to reasons described below. Russia mobile depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased by 15.4% to $1,111.9 million from $1,314.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily caused by depreciation of the ruble. The growth in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of segment total revenues was mainly due to the continued build-out and selective modernization of our network in Moscow, as well as the completion of the build-out of our proprietary long-distance network. Ukraine mobile depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $352.0 million, or 33.6% of segment total revenues, and $438.0 million, or 26.4% of segment total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the depreciation of the hryvnia. In hryvnia terms, depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately 19%. As a percentage of segment total revenues, depreciation and amortization expense increased from 26.4% to 33.6%, mainly due to the accelerated depreciation of certain billing equipment, which was withdrawn from operation and replaced by a new billing system. Other countries depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2009, slightly increased to $186.6 million from $186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, and slightly decreased as a percentage of segment total revenues to 23.7% from 23.9%. 158 Table of Contents Operating Income Consolidated operating income decreased by 29.5% to $2,555.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $3,627.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating income as a percentage of our total revenues decreased to 25.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 30.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease of operating income in absolute terms was mainly driven by the depreciation of the functional currencies in our countries of operation against the U.S. dollar combined with the other factors described above. The decrease in the operating income margin was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization, salaries and social contributions and rent expenses as a percentage of our total revenues. Russia mobile operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 30.5% to $ 1,945.6 million from $2, 800.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Russia operating income decreased as a percentage of segment revenues to 29.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, mainly due to the expansion of our retail network, which resulted in an increase in salaries and social contributions and rent, accelerated by historically lower margins on sales of handsets and accessories. The decrease in Russia mobile operating income margin was also attributable to higher sales and marketing costs as well the loss from the impairment of long-lived assets. Russia fixed operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 8.4% to $410.9 million from $448.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly as a result of ruble depreciation. The increase in Russia fixed operating income as a percentage of segment revenues to 27.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 25.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 was mainly due to the integration of our regional pay-TV operations and on-going implementation of cost reduction and cost control programs. Ukraine mobile operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 62.6% to $120.2 million from $321.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Ukraine operating income decreased as a percentage of segment revenues to 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 19.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008. These decreases were largely due to the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses and in rent, repair and maintenance costs, as well as by the overall decrease in revenues due to the highly competitive environment in Ukraine. Other countries operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 80.9% to $82.3 million from $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Other countries operating income increased as a percentage of segment revenues to 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly due to the optimization of our salary and social contribution costs, as discussed above. Currency exchange and transaction losses Consolidated currency exchange and transaction losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $252.7 million, compared to $562.0 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2008. We conduct our operations primarily within the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia, and we are therefore subject to currency fluctuations. The local currencies of these countries fluctuated significantly against the U.S. dollar and euro during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the currency exchange and transaction losses we incurred were primarily due to the translation effect of our U.S. dollar-denominated debt as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our borrowings consist of notes and bank loans. Since 2001, we have raised a total of $2.5 billion through seven U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured bond offerings in the international capital markets, as well as ruble-denominated bonds totaling RUR 80 billion (equivalent in aggregate to $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2010). Our bank loans consist of U.S. dollar-, euro- and ruble-denominated borrowings totaling approximately $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2010. We repaid approximately $5,642.0 million of indebtedness in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the total amount available to us under our credit facilities amounted to $2,959.3 million. We had total indebtedness of approximately $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2010, including capital lease obligations, compared to approximately $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2009. Our total interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, was $571.9 million and $777.3 million, net of amounts capitalized, respectively. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our indebtedness. Capital Requirements We need capital to finance the following: capital expenditures, consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; acquisitions; repayment of debt and related interest payments; changes in working capital; and general corporate activities, including dividends. We anticipate that capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of long-term debt and dividends will represent the most significant uses of funds for several years to come. Our cash outlays for capital expenditures in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were $2,612.8 million, $2,328.3 million and $2,647.1 million, respectively. We expect to continue to finance most of our capital expenditure needs through our operating cash flows, and to the extent required, to incur additional indebtedness through borrowings or additional capital raising activities. Historically, a significant portion of our capital expenditures have been related to the installation and build-out of our network and expansion into new license areas. We expect that capital expenditures will remain a large portion of our cash outflows in connection with the continued installation and build-out of our network. We expect our total capital expenditures in 2011 to be approximately 22-24% of our total 2011 revenue. These investments are required to support the growth in our subscriber base (i.e., to improve network capacity), to maintain and modernize our mobile and fixed line networks, to develop our network in the regions and to continue the build-out of our 3G and backbone networks as well as the development of our proprietary retail chain in Russia. We expect that the development of our 3G network and modernization of our fixed line networks will be among our most significant capital expenditures and require considerable management resources.
