Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Murphy Oils businesses operate in highly competitive environments, which could adversely affect it in many ways, including its profitability, its ability to grow, and its ability to manage its businesses. Murphy operates in the oil and gas industry and experiences intense competition from other oil and gas companies, which include state-owned foreign oil companies, major integrated oil companies, independent producers of oil and natural gas and independent refining and marketing companies. Virtually all of the state-owned and major integrated oil companies and many of the independent producers and refiners that compete with the Company have substantially greater resources than Murphy. In addition, the oil industry as a whole competes with other industries in supplying energy requirements around the world. Murphy competes, among other things, for valuable acreage positions, exploration licenses, drilling equipment and human resources. If Murphy cannot replace its oil and natural gas reserves, it will not be able to sustain or grow its business. Murphy continually depletes its oil and natural gas reserves as production occurs. In order to sustain and grow its business, the Company must successfully replace the crude oil and natural gas it produces with additional reserves. Therefore, it must create and maintain a portfolio of good prospects for future reserves additions and production by obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in promising areas. In addition, it must find, develop and produce and/or purchase reserves at a competitive cost structure to be successful in the long-term. Murphys ability to operate profitably in the exploration and production segments of its business, therefore, is dependent on its ability to find, develop and produce and/or purchase oil and natural gas reserves at costs that are less than the realized sales price for these products and at costs competitive with competing companies in the industry. Murphys proved reserves are based on the professional judgment of its engineers and may be subject to revision. Proved oil and natural gas reserves included in this report on pages F-48 and F-49 have been prepared by qualified Company personnel or qualified independent engineers based on an unweighted average of oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the years 2010 through 2012 as well as other conditions and information available at the time the estimates were prepared. Estimation of reserves is a subjective process that involves professional judgment by engineers about volumes to be recovered in future periods from underground crude oil and natural gas reservoirs. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, and consequently, different engineers could arrive at different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data and using industry accepted engineering practices and scientific methods. Under existing SEC rules, reported proved reserves must be reasonably certain of recovery in future periods. Murphys actual future crude oil and natural gas production may vary substantially from its reported quantity of proved reserves due to a number of factors, including:  Oil and natural gas prices which are materially different than prices used to compute proved reserves  Operating and/or capital costs which are materially different than those assumed to compute proved reserves  Future reservoir performance which is materially different from models used to compute proved reserves, and  Governmental regulations or actions which materially change operations of a field. 17 Table of Contents The Companys proved undeveloped reserves represent significant portions of total proved reserves. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 35% of the Companys proved oil reserves and 38% of proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped. The ability of the Company to reclassify these undeveloped proved reserves to the proved developed classification is generally dependent on the successful completion of one or more operations, which might include further development drilling, construction of facilities or pipelines, and well workovers. The discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves as reported on page F-53 should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on an unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those used in the reserves computations. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the crude oil and natural gas business in general. Volatility in the global prices of oil, natural gas and petroleum products significantly affects the Companys operating results. Among the most significant variables affecting the Companys results of operations are the sales prices for crude oil and natural gas that it produces. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices averaged about $94 per barrel in 2012, compared to $95 per barrel in 2011 and $80 per barrel in 2010. As an example of the impacts that oil and gas prices have on the Companys results of operations, the significant increase in oil prices in 2011 compared to the prior year favorably impacted earnings for the exploration and production business in that year. The average NYMEX natural gas sales prices were $2.83 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2012, down from $4.03 per MCF in 2011 and $4.38 per MCF in 2010. This lower price for natural gas hurt the Companys profits in North America in 2012. The Companys net income is also significantly affected by changes in the margins on refining and marketing operations. As demonstrated in 2012 and 2011, the sales prices for oil and natural gas can be significantly different in U.S. markets compared to markets in foreign locations. Certain of the Companys crude oil production is heavy and more sour than WTI quality crude; therefore, this crude oil usually sells at a discount to WTI and other light and sweet crude oils. In addition, the sales prices for heavy and sour crude oils do not always move in relation to price changes for WTI and lighter/sweeter crude oils. Certain crude oils produced outside North America generally price off different oil indices (Malaysia  Kikeh or Tapis and U.K.  Brent), and these indices are influenced by different supply and demand forces than those that affect the U.S. WTI prices. Certain natural gas production, particularly in Sarawak Malaysia and the U.K., have been sold in recent years at a premium to average North American natural gas prices due to different pricing structures for gas in these regions. The Company cannot predict how changes in the sales prices of oil and natural gas and changes in refining and marketing margins will affect its results of operations in future periods. Except in limited cases, the Company typically does not seek to hedge any significant portion of its exposure to the effects of changing prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Exploration drilling results can significantly affect the Companys operating results. The Company generally drills numerous wildcat wells each year which subjects its exploration and production operating results to significant exposure to dry holes expense, which have adverse effects on, and create volatility for, the Companys net income. In 2012, significant wildcat wells were primarily drilled offshore Republic of the Congo, Malaysia, Brunei and Australia, and onshore in Kurdistan. The Companys 2013 planned exploratory drilling program includes wells offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, Cameroon, Brunei, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, and onshore in Western Canada. 18 Table of Contents Capital financing may not always be available to fund Murphys activities. Murphy usually must spend and risk a significant amount of capital to find and develop reserves before revenue is generated from production. Although most capital needs are funded from operating cash flow, the timing of cash flows from operations and capital funding needs may not always coincide, and the levels of cash flow may not fully cover capital funding requirements. Therefore, the Company maintains financing arrangements with lending institutions to meet certain funding needs. The Company must periodically renew these financing arrangements based on foreseeable financing needs or as they expire. The Companys primary bank financing facility was renewed in 2011 and now expires in June 2016. Although not considered likely, there is the possibility that financing arrangements may not always be available at sufficient levels required to fund the Companys activities in future periods. The Company has a shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that permits the offer and sale of debt and/or equity securities through October 2015. Outstanding notes of $350 million matured in May 2012 and were replaced with $500 million of notes that mature in May 2022. Additionally, in November 2012, the Company sold $1.5 billion of notes that mature between 2017 and 2042. Although not considered likely, the Company may not be able in the future to sell notes at reasonable rates in the marketplace. Murphy has limited or virtually no control over several factors that could adversely affect the Company. The ability of the Company to successfully manage development and operating costs is important because virtually all of the products it sells are energy commodities such as crude oil, natural gas and refined products, for which the Company has little or no influence on the sales prices or regional and worldwide consumer demand for these products. As an example, an economic slowdown in 2009 had a detrimental effect on the worldwide demand for these energy commodities, which effectively led to reduced prices for oil, natural gas and refined products for a period of time. Lower prices for crude oil and natural gas inevitably lead to lower earnings in the Companys exploration and production operations. Murphy is a net purchaser of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks in the U.K., and also purchases refined products, particularly gasoline, needed to supply its U.S. retail marketing stations. Therefore, its most significant costs are subject to volatility of prices for these commodities. The Company also often experiences pressure on its operating and capital expenditures in periods of strong crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices because an increase in exploration and production activities due to high oil and gas sales prices generally leads to higher demand for, and consequently higher costs for, goods and services in the oil and gas industry. Many of the Companys major oil and natural gas producing properties are operated by others. Therefore, Murphy does not fully control all activities at certain of its significant revenue generating properties. During 2012, approximately 17% of the Companys total production was at fields operated by others, while at December 31, 2012, approximately 31% of the Companys total proved reserves were at fields operated by others. Murphys operations and earnings have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide political developments. Many governments, including those that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), unilaterally intervene at times in the orderly market of crude oil and natural gas produced in their countries through such actions as setting prices, determining rates of production, and controlling who may buy and sell the production. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 26% of proved reserves, as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, were located in countries other than the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Certain of the reserves held outside these three countries could be considered to have more political risk. In addition, prices and availability of crude oil, natural gas and refined products could be influenced by political unrest and by various governmental policies to restrict or increase petroleum usage and supply. Other governmental actions that could affect Murphys operations and earnings include expropriation, tax changes, royalty increases, redefinition of international boundaries and regulations concerning: currency fluctuations, protection and remediation of the environment, concerns over the possibility of global warming being affected by human 19 Table of Contents activity including the production and use of hydrocarbon energy, preferential and discriminatory awarding of oil and gas leases, restrictions on drilling and/or production, restraints and controls on imports and exports, safety, and relationships between employers and employees. Additionally, because of the numerous countries in which the Company operates, certain other risks exist, including the application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption compliance statutes. Because these and other factors too numerous to list are subject to changes caused by governmental and political considerations and are often made in response to changing internal and worldwide economic conditions and to actions of other governments or specific events, it is not practical to attempt to predict the effects of such factors on Murphys future operations and earnings. Murphys business is subject to operational hazards and risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas and the refining and marketing of crude oil and petroleum products. The Company operates in urban and remote, and often inhospitable, areas around the world. The occurrence of an event, including but not limited to acts of nature such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other forms of severe weather, and mechanical equipment failures, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, acts of war, civil unrest, piracy and acts of terrorism could result in the loss of hydrocarbons and associated revenues, environmental pollution or contamination, and personal injury, including death, for which the Company could be deemed to be liable, and which could subject the Company to substantial fines and/or claims for punitive damages. In April 2010, a drilling accident and subsequent oil spill occurred in the Gulf of Mexico at the Macondo well owned by other companies. Impacts of the accident and oil spill include added delays in deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling activities, additional regulations covering offshore drilling operations, and expected higher costs for future drilling operations and offshore insurance. Additional regulations, possible permitting delays and other restrictions associated with drilling and similar operations in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to have an adverse affect on the Companys, and likely many other companies, volume and costs of oil and natural gas produced in this area. The location of many of Murphys key assets causes the Company to be vulnerable to severe weather, including hurricanes and tropical storms. A number of significant oil and natural gas fields lie in offshore waters around the world. Probably the most vulnerable of the Companys offshore fields are in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where severe hurricanes and tropical storms have often led to shutdowns and damages. The U.S. hurricane season runs from June through November, but the most severe storm activities usually occur in late summer, such as with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Other assets such as gasoline terminals and certain retail gasoline stations also lie near the Gulf of Mexico coastline and are vulnerable to storm damages. Although the Company maintains insurance for such risks as described below, due to policy deductibles and possible coverage limits, weather-related risks are not fully insured. Murphy may be unable to complete its announced reorganization plan. The Company has announced a series of transactions, including the intended sale of its U.K. downstream business, separation of its U.S. downstream company, and up to a $1 billion share buyback program. Factors that could cause one or more of these events not to occur include, but are not limited to, a failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, a failure to obtain assurances of anticipated tax treatment, a deterioration in the business or prospects of Murphy or its subsidiaries, adverse developments in Murphy or its subsidiaries markets, adverse developments in the U.S. or global capital markets, credit markets or economies generally or a failure to execute a sale of the U.K. downstream operations on acceptable terms. If the anticipated transactions noted above are completed, Murphy will have fewer income-generating assets to service its debt. If the separation of the Companys U.S. downstream assets is completed, Murphy will no longer have the income generated from these assets to make interest and principal payments on its debt. Similarly, if the proposed sale of 20 Table of Contents Murphys U.K. downstream operations is completed, the Company will no longer have the income generated from these assets to service its debt. If Murphys remaining business is not successful as a stand-alone company, the Company may not have sufficient income to make interest payments on outstanding notes, repay the notes at maturity or refinance the notes on acceptable terms, if at all. Murphys insurance may not be adequate to offset costs associated with certain events and there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in the future on terms that justify its purchase. Murphy maintains insurance against certain, but not all, hazards that could arise from its operations. The Company maintains liability insurance sufficient to cover its share of gross insured claim costs up to approximately $700 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate. These policies have up to $10 million in deductibles. Generally, this insurance covers various types of third party claims related to personal injury, death and property damage, including claims arising from sudden and accidental pollution events. The Company also maintains insurance coverage with an additional limit of $300 million per occurrence ($700 million for Gulf of Mexico operations not related to a named windstorm), all or part of which could be applicable to certain sudden and accidental pollution events. The occurrence of an event that is not insured or not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations in the future. Lawsuits against Murphy and its subsidiaries could adversely affect its operating results. The Company is involved in numerous lawsuits seeking cash settlements for alleged personal injuries, property damages and other business-related matters. Certain of these lawsuits will take many years to resolve through court proceedings or negotiated settlements. None of these lawsuits are considered individually material or aggregate to a material amount in the opinion of management. The Company is exposed to credit risks associated with sales of certain of its products to third parties. Although Murphy limits its credit risk by selling its products to numerous entities worldwide, it still, at times, carries substantial credit risk from its customers. For certain oil and gas properties operated by the Company, other companies which own partial interests may not be able to meet their financial obligation to pay for their share of capital and operating costs as they come due. Murphys operations could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency conversion rates. The Companys worldwide operational scope exposes it to risks associated with foreign currencies. Most of the Companys business is transacted in U.S. dollars, therefore, the Company and most of its subsidiaries are U.S. dollar functional entities for accounting purposes. However, the Canadian dollar is the functional currency for all Canadian operations and the British pound is the functional currency for U.K. refining and marketing operations. In certain countries, such as Malaysia, the United Kingdom and Canada, significant levels of transactions occur in currencies other than the functional currency. In Malaysia, such transactions include tax payments, while in the U.K., virtually all crude oil feedstock purchases and certain bulk product sales are priced in U.S. dollars, and in Canada, certain crude oil sales are priced in U.S. dollars. This exposure to currencies other than the functional currency can lead to significant impacts on consolidated financial results. In Malaysia, known future tax payments based in local currency are usually hedged with contracts that match tax payment amounts and dates to lock in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Malaysian ringgit. Exposures associated with deferred income tax liability balances in Malaysia are not hedged. A strengthening of the Malaysian ringgit against the U.S. dollar would be expected to lead to currency losses in consolidated income; gains would be expected in income if the ringgit weakens versus the dollar. Foreign exchange exposures between the U.S. dollar and the British pound are not hedged due to the frequency and volatility of U.S. dollar transactions in the U.K. downstream business. The Company would generally expect to incur currency losses when the U.S. dollar strengthens against the British pound and would conversely expect currency gains when the U.S. dollar weakens 21 Table of Contents against the pound. In Canada, currency risk is often managed by selling forward U.S. dollars to match the collection dates for crude oil sold in that currency. See Note K in the consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivative contracts. The costs and funding requirements related to the Companys retirement plans are affected by several factors. A number of actuarial assumptions impact funding requirements for the Companys retirement plans. The most significant of these assumptions include return on assets, long-term interest rates and mortality. If the actual results for the plans vary significantly from the actuarial assumptions used, or if laws regulating such retirement plans are changed, Murphy could be required to make more significant funding payments to one or more of its retirement plans in the future and/or it could be required to record a larger liability for future obligations in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Company had no unresolved comments from the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2012.
