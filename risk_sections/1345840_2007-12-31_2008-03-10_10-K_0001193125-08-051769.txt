Item 1A. Risk Factors This section should be read carefully considering the risks described below as well as other information and data included in this report. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our business. Risks Related to the Nature and Operation of Our Business The network communications industry is highly competitive. We may be unsuccessful in competing effectively against other terrestrial and satellite-based network providers in our Network Equipment and Services businesses. We operate in a highly competitive network communications industry in the sale and lease of our products and services. Our industry is characterized by competitive pressures to provide enhanced functionality for the same or lower price with each new generation of technology. As the prices of our products decrease, we will need to sell more products and/or reduce the per-unit costs to improve or maintain our results of operations. Our Network Equipment and Services businesses face competition from providers of terrestrial-based networks, such as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modem service, Multiprotocol Label Switching and Internet protocol-based virtual private networks (IP VPNs), which may have advantages over satellite networks for certain customer applications. Terrestrial-based networks are offered by telecommunications carriers and other large companies, many of which have substantially greater financial resources and greater name recognition than us. The costs of a satellite network may exceed those of a terrestrial-based network, especially in areas that have experienced significant DSL and cable internet build-out. It may become more difficult for us to compete with terrestrial providers as the number of these areas increase and the cost of their network and hardware services declines. In addition, government agencies are increasingly considering and implementing subsidies for deployment of broadband access in underserved areas. Depending on how the particular programs are structured, these subsidies may favor, or in some cases be limited to, terrestrial-based services. To increase our competitiveness, in some cases, we pair our satellite offerings with terrestrial solutions, which may result in lower margins. We rely on third parties to implement the terrestrial component of these paired satellite/terrestrial solutions which means that we cannot control the implementation and rollout of these paired satellite/terrestrial solutions to the same degree as our satellite only solutions. We also compete for enterprise clients with other satellite network providers, satellite providers that are targeting the SMB markets and smaller independent systems integrators on procurement projects. In Asia and Latin America, the build-out of terrestrial networks has adversely impacted demand for VSAT services and regulation and inequitable access remain barriers to new business. The Consumer network communications market is highly competitive. We may be unsuccessful in competing effectively against DSL and cable service providers and other satellite broadband providers in our Consumer group. We face competition for our Consumer satellite internet subscribers primarily from satellite, DSL and cable internet service providers. Also, other satellite and wireless broadband companies have launched or are planning the launch of consumer satellite internet access services in competition with us in North America. Some of these competitors offer consumer services and hardware at lower prices than ours. We have experienced and may continue to experience, increased competition with the entrance of these new competitors into our market and the increasing build-out and lowering cost of DSL and cable internet access in North America. In addition, terrestrial alternatives do not require our external dish which may limit customer acceptance of our products. We also may face competition from our former parent, The DIRECTV Group, Inc. (DIRECTV). For a description of this risk, see DIRECTV may compete with us in certain sectors and subject to certain conditions. 17 Table of Contents If we are unable to develop, introduce and market new products, applications and services on a cost effective and timely basis, or if we are unable to sell our new products and services to existing and new customers, our business could be adversely affected. The network communications market is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. If we fail to develop new technology or keep pace with significant industry technological changes, our existing products and technology could be rendered obsolete. Even if we keep up with technological innovation, we may not meet the demands of the network communications market. For example, our large enterprise customers may only choose to renew services with us at substantially lower prices or for a decreased level of service. Many of our large enterprise customers have existing networks available to them and may opt to find alternatives to our VSAT services or may renew with us solely as a backup network. If we are unable to respond to technological advances on a cost effective and timely basis, or if our products or applications are not accepted by the market, then our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Economic factors may result in reduced demand and pricing pressure on our products and services. The telecommunications industry has been facing significant challenges resulting from excess capacity, new technologies and intense price competition. An overall trend toward industry consolidation and rationalization among our customers, competitors and suppliers can affect our business. Any future weakness in the economy or the telecommunications industry would affect us through reduced demand for, and pricing pressure on, our products and services, leading to a reduction in revenues and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face risks associated with our SPACEWAY 3 satellite. In addition to the competitive risks for the satellite network services mentioned above, if we are unable to successfully implement our SPACEWAY 3 satellite as a result of any of the following risks, we will be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our SPACEWAY 3 satellite, and our business and financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected:  Business planOur SPACEWAY business plan may be unsuccessful, and we may not be able to achieve the cost savings that we expect from the SPACEWAY 3 satellite. A failure to attract a sufficient number of customers would result in our inability to realize the cost savings that we expect to achieve from the anticipated lower costs of bandwidth associated with the capacity of the SPACEWAY 3 satellite. In addition, we will incur start-up losses associated with the launch and operation of SPACEWAY 3 until we acquire a sufficient number of customers.  Regulatory license riskThe SPACEWAY 3 satellite is primarily intended to provide services to North America. The SPACEWAY 3 spacecraft operations are subject to compliance with the licensing conditions of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and those of any other government whose ITU filing we may use to operate SPACEWAY 3 in the future. If we are unable to obtain landing rights in any of the countries in which we intend to provide service, we would then be unable to operate in that country and would fail to receive the corresponding revenue.  In-orbit risksThe SPACEWAY 3 satellite is subject to similar potential satellite failures or performance degradations as other satellites. In-orbit risks similar to those described below under Satellite failures or degradations in satellite performance could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations apply to the SPACEWAY 3 satellite. To the extent there is an anomaly or other in-orbit failure with respect to the SPACEWAY 3 satellite, we do not currently have a replacement satellite or backup transponder capacity and would have to identify and lease alternative transponder capacity that may not be available on economic terms or at all. Additionally, we could be required to reposition the antennas of our customers, which would entail significant cost and could require new or modified licenses from regulatory authorities. 18 Table of Contents  Novel designThe SPACEWAY 3 satellite employs a complex and novel design intended for higher-speed data rates and greater bandwidth per network site. If the enhanced features of the satellite design do not function to their specifications, we may not be able to offer the functionality or throughput of transmission service that we expect for SPACEWAY 3. Satellite failures or degradations in satellite performance could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For our current customers, we lease satellite transponder capacity from fixed satellite service (FSS) providers in order to send and receive data communications to and from our VSAT networks. Beginning in the first quarter of 2008, we will also provide satellite transponder capacity on our SPACEWAY 3 satellite. Satellites are subject to in-orbit risks including malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, and collisions with meteoroids, decommissioned spacecraft or other space debris. Anomalies occur as a result of various factors, such as satellite manufacturing errors, problems with the power systems or control systems of the satellites and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh space environment. For risks associated with anomalies affecting our SPACEWAY 3 satellite, see We face risks associated with our SPACEWAY 3 satellite. Any single anomaly or series of anomalies affecting the satellites on which we lease transponder capacity could materially adversely affect our operations and revenues and our relationships with current customers, as well as our ability to attract new customers for our satellite services. Anomalies may also reduce the expected useful life of a satellite, thereby creating additional expenses due to the need to provide replacement or backup capacity and potentially reduce revenues if service is interrupted on the satellites we utilize. We may not be able to obtain backup capacity at similar prices, or at all. See The failure to adequately anticipate the need for transponder capacity or the inability to obtain transponder capacity could harm our results of operations. In the event of a satellite failure, our services may be unavailable for several days to several weeks while backup in-orbit satellites are repositioned and services are moved or while we reposition our customers antennas to alternative satellites. From time-to-time we experience brief outages as a result of short-lived anomalies on the satellites we use. In such cases, service is generally restored on the affected satellite on the same day. In most instances, any relocation to an alternative satellite will require prior regulatory approval, which may not be obtained, or obtained in a timely manner. In addition, the entities from which we lease transponder capacity could be severely affected by anomalies affecting their satellites, which could result in disruption to the services they provide to us. An increased frequency of anomalies could impact market acceptance of our services. Any failure on our part to perform our VSAT service contracts or provide satellite broadband access as a result of satellite failures could result in: (i) a loss of revenue despite continued obligations under our leasing arrangements; (ii) possible cancellation of our long-term contracts; (iii) inability to continue with our subscription-based customers; (iv) incurring additional expenses to reposition customer antennas to alternative satellites; and (v) damaging our reputation, which could negatively affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new business. The cancellation of long-term contracts due to service disruptions is an exception to the generally non-cancelable nature of our contracts, and such cancellation would reduce our revenue backlog described in this report. See The failure to adequately anticipate the need for transponder capacity or the inability to obtain transponder capacity could harm our results of operations. Our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks. We expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations. Our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully obtain or use information on the network or cause interruptions, delays or malfunctions in our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect 19 Table of Contents against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches. In addition, our customer contracts, in general, do not contain provisions which would protect us against liability to third parties with whom our customers conduct business. Although we have implemented and intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could lower network operations center availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. DIRECTV may compete with us in certain sectors and subject to certain conditions. While we have entered into a non-competition agreement with DIRECTV in connection with our separation from DIRECTV in 2005, DIRECTV has retained the right to compete with us in selling data services to consumers at all times and may compete with us in all areas after the five-year term of the non-competition agreement which commenced on April 22, 2005. In addition, while the non-competition agreement restricts DIRECTV from using its two SPACEWAY satellites for data service offerings that would directly compete with us, DIRECTV is not limited in such use if the video capability of its SPACEWAY satellites does not remain capable of commercial operations. Moreover, DIRECTV is not restricted from competing with our business if such data services are incidental to DIRECTVs provision of a video service to an enterprise customer and are an integral part of such video service or are available as an optional add-on to such video service. In any event, DIRECTV may compete with us after the non-competition agreement expires on April 22, 2010. We may not be able to sustain the earnings growth that we have experienced in recent years. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we generated net income of $49.8 million, $19.1 million and $24.0 million, respectively. Although our profitability has grown in recent years, we may be unable to sustain such growth rates in light of changing market or economic conditions or as a result of increases in depreciation and other costs resulting from placing the SPACEWAY 3 satellite into service. In addition, any inability on our part to control costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon suppliers of components, manufacturing outsourcing, installation and customer service and our results of operations may be materially affected if any of these third party providers fail to appropriately deliver the contracted goods or services. We are dependent upon third party services and products provided to us, including the following:  ComponentsA limited number of suppliers manufacture some of the key components required to build our VSATs. These key components may not be continually available and we may not be able to forecast our component requirements sufficiently in advance, which may have a detrimental effect on supply. If we are required to change suppliers for any reason, we would experience a delay in manufacturing our products if another supplier is not able to meet our requirements on a timely basis. In addition, if we are unable to obtain the necessary volumes of components on favorable terms or prices on a timely basis, we may be unable to produce our products at competitive prices and we may be unable to satisfy demand from our customers. All of our products contain components whose base raw materials have undergone dramatic cost fluctuations in the last 18 months. Increases in pricing of crude oil, gold and other metals such as zinc and aluminum have the ability to affect our product costs. Although we have been successful in offsetting or mitigating our exposure to these raw material cost increases, such increases could have an adverse impact on our product costs.  Manufacturing outsourcingWhile we develop and manufacture prototypes for our products, we use contract manufacturers to produce a significant portion of our hardware. If these contract manufacturers fail to provide products that meet our specifications in a timely manner, then our customer relationships may be harmed. 20 Table of Contents  Installation and customer support serviceEach of our North American and international operations utilize a network of third party installers to deploy our hardware. In addition, a portion of our customer support and management is provided by offshore call centers. Since we provide customized services for our customers that are essential to their operations, a decline in levels of service or attention to the needs of our customers or the occurrence of negligent and careless acts could adversely affect our reputation, renewal rates and ability to win new business. The failure to adequately anticipate the need for transponder capacity or the inability to obtain transponder capacity could harm our results of operations. We have made substantial contractual commitments for transponder capacity based on our existing customer contracts and backlog, as well as anticipated future business, to the extent our existing customers are not expected to utilize our SPACEWAY 3 satellite. If future demand does not meet our expectations, we will be committed to maintain excess transponder capacity for which we will have no or insufficient revenues to cover our costs, which would have a negative impact on our margins and results of operations. Our transponder leases are generally for two to five years, and different leases cover satellites with coverage of different geographical areas or support different applications and features, so we may not be able to quickly or easily adjust our capacity to changes in demand. If we only purchase transponder capacity based on existing contracts and bookings, capacity for certain types of coverage in the future that cannot be readily served by SPACEWAY 3 may be unavailable to us and we may not be able to satisfy certain needs of our customers, which could result in a loss of possible new business and could negatively impact the margins earned for those services. At present, until the launch and operation of additional satellites, there is limited availability of capacity on the Ku-band frequencies in North America. In addition, the FSS industry has seen consolidation in the past decade, and today, the three main FSS providers in North America and a number of smaller regional providers own and operate the current satellites that are available for our capacity needs. The failure of any of these FSS providers or a downturn in their industry as a whole could reduce or interrupt the Ka-band capacity available to us. If we are not able to renew our capacity leases at economically viable rates, or if capacity is not available due to any problems of the FSS providers, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected, to the extent SPACEWAY is unable to satisfy the associated demand. If our products contain defects, we could be subject to significant costs to correct such defects and our product and network service contracts could be delayed or cancelled, which could expose us to significant liability and adversely affect our revenues. The products and the networks we deploy are highly complex, and some may contain defects when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, despite extensive testing and our quality control procedures. In addition, many of our products and network services are designed to interface with our customers existing networks, each of which has different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards. Our products and services must interoperate with the other products and services within our customers networks, as well as with future products and services that might be added to these networks, to meet our customers requirements. Further, in the consumer market, our products are usually installed in residential and other locations where there might be a higher likelihood of product liability claims relating to improper or unsafe products or installations. The occurrence of any defects, errors or failures in our products or network services could result in: (i) additional costs to correct such defects; (ii) cancellation of orders; (iii) a reduction in revenue backlog; (iv) product returns or recalls; (v) diversion of our resources; (vi) legal actions by our customers or our customers end users, including for damages caused by a defective product; and (vii) the issuance of credits to customers and other losses to us, our customers or end users. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services and loss of sales, which would harm our reputation and our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, our insurance would not cover the cost of correcting significant errors, defects, or security problems. 21 Table of Contents Our failure to develop, obtain or protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth. Our success depends on our ability to develop and protect our proprietary rights to the technologies and inventions used in our services and products, including proprietary VSAT technology and related services and products. We rely on a combination of United States and foreign patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws as well as licenses, nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual agreements or restrictions to protect certain aspects of our business. We have registered trademarks and patents and have pending trademark and patent applications in the United States and a number of foreign countries. However, our patent and trademark applications may not be allowed by the applicable governmental authorities to issue as patents or register as trademarks at all, or in a form that will be advantageous to us. In addition, in some instances, we may not have registered important patent and trademark rights in these and other countries. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect and do not allow us to enforce our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. As such, our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. Accordingly, we might not be able to protect our proprietary products and technologies against unauthorized third party copying or use, which could negatively affect our competitive position. We may fail to recognize opportunities to provide, maintain or enforce intellectual property protection for our business. Furthermore, our intellectual property may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights, may be infringed or misappropriated by others or may diminish in value over time. Our competitors may be able to freely make use of our patented technology after our patents expire or may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of our patents, trademarks or trade secrets. Competitors also may independently develop products or services that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, it may be possible for third parties to reverse-engineer, otherwise obtain, copy and use information that we regard as proprietary. If we are unable to protect our services and products through the enforcement of our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete based on our current market advantages may be harmed. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. If we fail to prevent substantial unauthorized access to our trade secrets, we risk the loss of those intellectual property rights and whatever competitive advantage they provide us. Claims that our services and products infringe the intellectual property rights of others could increase our costs and reduce our sales, which would adversely affect our revenue. We have received, and may in the future receive, communications from third parties claiming that we or our products infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. We have also been named in the past, and may be named in the future as a defendant in lawsuits claiming that our services or products infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of third party rights or to defend against claims of infringement. Litigation may also be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable. Such litigation, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, including time and attention of management and other key personnel, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We expect to be increasingly subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows. 22 Table of Contents Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those that we currently offer or may offer in the future. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our services or products infringe on valid and enforceable intellectual property owned by others, we may be liable for money damages and may be required to cease developing or marketing those services and products, unless we obtain licenses from the owners of the intellectual property or redesign those services and products in such a way as to avoid infringing on those intellectual property rights. If a third party holds intellectual property rights, it may not allow us to use our intellectual property at any price, or on terms acceptable to us, which could materially adversely affect our competitive position. We may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our services or products may potentially infringe. Further, without lengthy litigation, it may not be possible to determine definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid. We cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain intellectual property licenses or the availability and cost of any such licenses. Those costs, and their impact on our earnings, could be material. Damages in patent infringement cases may also include treble damages in certain circumstances. To the extent that we are required to pay royalties to third parties to whom we are not currently making payments, these increased costs of doing business could materially adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, under some of our agreements with customers, we are not permitted to use all or some of the intellectual property developed for that customer for other customers, and in other cases, we have agreed not to provide similar services to such customers competitors. Further, our service agreements with our customers generally provide that we will defend and indemnify them for claims against them relating to our alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights with respect to services and products we provide. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonably terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products. In addition, our patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights may be subject to various attacks claiming they are invalid or unenforceable. These attacks might invalidate, render unenforceable or otherwise limit the scope of the protection that our patents, trademarks and other rights afford us. If we lose the use of a product name or brand name, our efforts spent on building that brand may be lost, and we will have to rebuild a brand for that product, which we may or may not be able to do, and which would cause us to incur new costs in connection with building such brand name. If we are involved in a patent infringement suit, even if we prevail, there is no assurance that third parties will not be able to design around our patents, which could harm our competitive position. If we are unable to license technology from third parties on satisfactory terms, our developmental costs could increase and we may not be able to deploy our services and products in a timely manner. We depend, in part, on technology that we license from third parties on a non-exclusive basis and integrate into our products and service offerings. Licenses for third party technology that we use in our current products may be terminated or not renewed, and we may be unable to license third party technology necessary for such products in the future. Furthermore, we may be unable to renegotiate acceptable third party license terms to reflect changes in our pricing models. Changes to or the loss of a third party license could lead to an increase in the costs of licensing or inoperability of products or network services. In addition, technology licensed from third parties may have undetected errors that impair the functionality or prevent the successful integration of our products or services. As a result of any such changes or loss, we may need to incur additional development costs to ensure continued performance of our products or suffer delays until replacement technology, if available, can be obtained and integrated. 23 Table of Contents Our Parent is majority-owned by various investment vehicles affiliated with Apollo Management, L. P. (together with its affiliates, Apollo) and Apollos interests as an equity holder may conflict with those of the holders of our 9 1/2% senior notes (Senior Notes). At December 31, 2007, Apollo owned in the aggregate 12,408,611 shares, or approximately 64.6%, of HCIs issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, Apollo has control over HCIs management and policies, such as the election of its directors, the appointment of new management and the approval of any other action requiring the approval of HCI stockholders, including any amendments to its certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of all or substantially all of its assets. The interests of Apollo may not in all cases be aligned with those of the holders of the Senior Notes. Furthermore, Apollo may, in the future, own businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us. Apollo may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Apollo has other investments in the satellite and telecommunications industry and subject to limitations contained in our limited liability company agreement, the indenture governing the Senior Notes, our $50.0 million revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) and our $115.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan Facility) regarding affiliate transactions, Apollo may cause us to enter into transactions with their affiliates to buy or sell assets. Our future success depends on our ability to retain our key employees. We are dependent on the services of HCI and our senior management team to remain competitive in our industry. The loss of one or more members of HCI or our senior management team could have an adverse effect on us until qualified replacements are found. We may not be able to quickly replace these individuals with persons of equal experience and capabilities. In addition, technological innovation depends, to a significant extent, on the work of technically skilled employees. Competition for executive, managerial and skilled personnel in our industry is intense. We expect to face continued increases in compensation costs in order to attract and retain senior executives, managers and skilled employees, especially if the current job economy improves. We may not be able to retain our existing senior management, fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract or retain the management and personnel necessary to develop and market our products. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of these individuals. Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business We may face difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals for our provision of telecommunications services, and we may face changes in regulation, each of which could adversely affect our operations. In a number of countries where we operate, the provision of telecommunications services is highly regulated. In such countries, we are required to obtain approvals from national and local authorities in connection with most of the services that we provide. In many jurisdictions, we must maintain such approvals through compliance with license conditions or payment of annual regulatory fees. While the governmental authorizations for our current business generally have not been difficult to obtain in a timely manner, the need to obtain particular authorizations in the future may delay our provision of current and new services. Moreover, the imposition by a governmental entity of conditions on our authorizations, or the failure to obtain authorizations necessary to launch and operate satellites or provide satellite service, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and conduct our business as currently planned. Violations of laws or regulations may result in various sanctions including fines, loss of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or for the renewal of existing authorizations. Future changes to the regulations under which we operate could make it difficult for us to obtain or maintain authorizations, increase our costs or make it easier or less expensive for our competitors to compete with us. 24 Table of Contents We may face difficulties in accurately assessing and collecting contributions towards the Universal Service Fund. As a provider of telecommunications in the U.S., we are presently required to contribute a percentage of our revenues from telecommunications services to universal service support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to low-income consumers, high-cost areas, schools, libraries and rural health care providers. This percentage is set each calendar quarter by the FCC. Current FCC rules permit us to pass this universal service contribution onto our customers. Because our customer contracts often include both telecommunications services, which create such support obligations, and other goods and services, which do not, it can be difficult to determine which portion of our revenues forms the basis for this contribution and the amount that we can recover from our customers. If the FCC, which oversees the support mechanisms, or a court or other governmental entity were to determine that we computed our contribution obligation incorrectly or passed the wrong amount onto our customers, we could become subject to additional assessments, liabilities, or other financial penalties. In addition, the FCC is considering substantial changes to its universal service contribution rules, and these changes could impact our future contribution obligations and those of third parties that provide communication services to our business. Any such change to the universal service contribution rules could adversely affect our costs of providing service to our customers. Our international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. United States laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The export of certain satellite hardware, services and technical data relating to satellites is regulated by the United States Department of States Directorate of Defense Trade Controls under ITAR. Other items are controlled for export by the United States Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security under the EAR. We cannot provide services to certain countries subject to United States trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), that, generally, bars bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. See Item 1. BusinessGovernment Regulation. Following a voluntary disclosure by DIRECTV and DTV Networks in June 2004, DIRECTV and DTV Networks entered into a consent agreement with the U.S. Department of State in January 2005 regarding alleged violations of the ITAR relating to exports by us of VSAT technology, primarily to China. Under the consent agreement, which applies to us, DIRECTV agreed to pay a $4.0 million fine over a period of three years and we are required to establish and maintain a special compliance official for a period of three years. The special compliance official is an independent contractor with authority to oversee matters relating to compliance with the ITAR. Under the consent agreement, the three-year term of the special compliance official ended in January 2008. The consent agreement also requires us to establish and maintain a successor internal special compliance official for a period of two years from January 2008 to January 2010, who will have the authority to oversee matters relating to compliance with ITAR. We have satisfied the requirement in the consent agreement that we spend $1.0 million over a period of three years for certain enhanced remedial compliance measures. As part of the consent agreement, one of our subsidiaries in China was debarred from conducting certain international business, although we may seek reinstatement in the future. The January 2005 consent agreement supplemented another consent agreement of DIRECTV in March 2003, which applies to us and arose out of separate violations of ITAR in which we were a named party. 25 Table of Contents Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A future violation of ITAR or the other regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our foreign operations expose us to regulatory risks and restrictions not present in our domestic operations. Our operations outside the United States accounted for approximately 26.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, and we expect our foreign operations to continue to represent a significant portion of our business. We have operations in Brazil, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the Russian Federation, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, among other nations, and over the last 20 years, we have sold products in over 100 countries. Our foreign operations involve varying degrees of risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business abroad. Such risks include:  Complications in complying with restrictions on foreign ownership and investment and limitations on repatriationWe may not be permitted to own our operations in some countries and may have to enter into partnership or joint venture relationships. Many foreign legal regimes restrict our repatriation of earnings to the United States from our subsidiaries and joint venture entities. We may also be limited in our ability to distribute or access our assets by the governing documents pertaining to such entities. In such event, we will not have access to the cash flow and assets of our joint ventures.  Difficulties in following a variety of foreign laws and regulations, such as those relating to data content retention, privacy and employee welfareOur international operations are subject to the laws of many different jurisdictions that may differ significantly from United States law. For example, local political or intellectual property law may hold us responsible for the data that is transmitted over our network by our clients. Also, other nations have more stringent employee welfare laws that guarantee perquisites that we must offer. Compliance with these laws may lead to increased operations costs, loss of business opportunities or violations that result in fines or other penalties.  We face significant competition in our international marketsOutside North America, we have traditionally competed for VSAT hardware and services sales primarily in Europe, Brazil and India and focused only on hardware sales in other regions. In Europe, we face intense competition which is not expected to abate in the near future.  Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the United States dollarWe conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of a number of the countries in which we operate. Accordingly, our results of operations are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to United States dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. Because our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures operate in foreign currencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates have affected, and may in the future affect, the value of profits earned on international sales. In addition, we sell our products and services and acquire supplies and components from countries that historically have been, and may continue to be, susceptible to recessions or currency devaluation.  Greater exposure to the possibility of economic instability, the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances, expropriation or warAs we conduct operations throughout the world, we could be subject to regional or national economic downturns or instability, labor or political disturbances or conflicts of various sizes. Any of these disruptions could detrimentally affect our sales in the affected region or country or lead to damage to, or expropriation of, its property or danger to our personnel.  Competition with large or state-owned enterprises and/or regulations that effectively limit our operations and favor local competitorsMany of the countries in which we conduct business have traditionally had state owned or state granted monopolies on telecommunications services that favor an incumbent service provider. We face competition from these favored and entrenched companies in 26 Table of Contents countries that have not deregulated. The slower pace of deregulation in these countries, particularly in Asia and Latin America, has adversely affected the growth of our business in these regions.  Customer credit risksCustomer credit risks are exacerbated in foreign operations because there is often little information available about the credit histories of customers in the foreign countries in which we operate. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness Our high level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and could limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations. We are significantly leveraged. The following table shows our level of indebtedness as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): December 31,2007 Senior notes $ 450,000 Term loans payable to banks 116,269 VSAT hardware financing 23,390 Revolving bank borrowings 2,897 Total debt $ 592,556 Our substantial degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following:  it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including its operations, capital expenditures, investments in new technologies and future business opportunities;  the Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain of our unsecured term loans are at a variable rate of interest, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, except for instances where we have entered into interest rate swap agreements;  it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt or more financial resources; and  we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic condition or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth. We may not be able to generate cash to meet our debt service needs. Our ability to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject in part to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings are not available to us, we may not be able to service our indebtedness. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result:  our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;  the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to loan us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and 27 Table of Contents  we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in the holders of the Senior Notes losing their investment. Covenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways. The indenture governing the Senior Notes and the credit agreement governing the Term Loan Facility contain various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:  incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;  incur liens;  pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;  prepay, redeem or repurchase debt;  make loans and investments;  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from its subsidiaries;  sell assets and capital stock of its subsidiaries;  enter into certain transactions with its affiliates;  consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of its assets to, another person; and  enter into new lines of business. In addition, our Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants. A breach of any of the covenants under the indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility could result in a default under our Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Senior Notes and/or the Term Loan Facility. Upon an event of default under our Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could proceed against the collateral that secures that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Revolving Credit Facility. Item 1B.
