You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this report before you decide to buy our Common Stock. Our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumer discretionary spending and demand for items that incorporate our products in the consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A decline in end-user demand can affect our customers demand for our products, the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our revenues, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected by such actions. During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower revenues and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficult economic environments, we could be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacity are expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory. This was the case at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009 when our utilization rates declined to abnormally low production levels, which resulted in lower gross margins. The market conditions in the future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry and/or changes in end-market demand could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodically experiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excess inventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, the semiconductor industry experiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resulting in significant revenue declines, due to excess inventories at end-equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. The market for semiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns, which may harm our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as a result, cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they do to the broader semiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition than compared to some of our broad line semiconductor manufacturer competitors. In addition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and the costs associated with the introduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand in the consumer electronics, computing, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. These end-user markets also tend to be cyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensified competition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability and customer service. We compete in various markets with companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater resources or capabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to develop new products, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad line semiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types and technologies than we do. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current major competitors are Fairchild -10- Table of Contents Semiconductor Corporation, Infineon Technologies A.G., International Rectifier Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competitive pressures may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We receive a portion of our net sales from three customers, which all are related parties. In addition, two of these customers are large external suppliers. The loss of these customers or suppliers could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, LSC, our largest stockholder, accounted for less than 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively, of our net sales. LSC is also our largest supplier, providing us with discrete semiconductor products for subsequent sale by us, which represented approximately 5%, 7% and 6%, respectively, of our net sales, in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we subcontracted a portion of our manufacturing to Eris Technology Corporation (Eris), a publicly traded company listed as an Emerging Stock on the Taiwan OTC Exchange (TWO) that provides design, manufacturing and after-market services for diode products. We purchase finished goods, some sourced from our wafers and some not sourced from our wafers. Eris provides us with discrete semiconductor products for subsequent sale by us, which represented approximately 2%, 3% and 3%, respectively, of our net sales, in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In addition, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, we sold products to companies owned by Keylink, totaling 2%, 3% and 3%, respectively. Also for 2011, 2010 and 2009, 1%, 2% and 1%, respectively, of our net sales were from semiconductor products purchased from companies owned by Keylink. The loss of LSC, Keylink or Eris as either a customer or a supplier, or any significant reductions in either the amount of products LSC, Keklink and/or Eris supplies to us, or the volume of orders LSC, Keylink or Eris places with us, could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Delays in initiation of production at facilities due to implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Our manufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve yields and product performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead to production delays, order cancellations and lost revenue. In addition, any problems in achieving acceptable yields, construction delays, or other problems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities, building new facilities, bringing new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints, production delays and a loss of future revenues and customers. Our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately, or in the event of a decline in demand for our products. Our wafer fabrication facilities are located near Kansas City, Missouri, and near Manchester, United Kingdom (U.K.), while our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China and Neuhaus, Germany, perform packaging, assembly and test functions and our two joint venture facilities in Chengdu, China for surface mount component production, assembly and test functions. Any disruption of operations at these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins. Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remain competitive and retain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our costs through product and manufacturing improvements. We must also strive to minimize our customers shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supply and production. We experienced a decrease in average selling prices (ASP) for our products of 10% in 2009, an increase of 5% in 2010 and a decrease of 2% in 2011. At times, we may be required to sell our products at ASP below our manufacturing costs or purchase prices in order to remain competitive. Our growth and the profit margins of our products will suffer if we cannot effectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product prices competitive. -11- Table of Contents Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product, changes in the products manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation or reduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts, and are booked from one to twelve months in advance of delivery. The rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorter lead-times, which is the amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customer requires shipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods of excess inventory due to changes in demand in the end markets our industry serves. As a result, many of our purchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and with little or no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources to fulfilling these purchase orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of purchase orders are cancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generate replacement orders, we may build up excess inventory and our revenues, results of operations and financial condition may suffer. Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers demands and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, disease or other similar natural disasters, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, labor shortages, power outages or shortages, telecommunications failures, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, terrorism or other extraordinary events. Such disruptions may cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property and related internal controls with significant indirect consequences. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption, and we may not be able to meet our customers needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results of operations and financial condition. Our product range and new product development program are focused on discrete, logic and analog semiconductor products. Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changes in existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materially delay development of new products, which could result in a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. This includes the development of new types of technology or the improvement of existing technologies, such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace, discrete semiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. -12- Table of Contents Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, and since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broader semiconductor industry, this may have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-line semiconductor manufacturer with a wider range of product types and technologies. Many of our competitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize on any fundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, could harm our business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry and harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce package sizes, improve manufacturing yields and expand our sales. We may not be able to accomplish these goals, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results of operations and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrative activities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we have upgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgrade other information technology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and customer issues therewith), or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. A significant portion of our operations operate on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on ERP systems different from ours and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technology that is important to our business and have demanded, and may in the future demand, that we license their patents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our products infringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless of its merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling we could be required to:  pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;  cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;  discontinue the use of infringing technology;  expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;  pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; -13- Table of Contents  license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or  relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable. We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, parts and equipment on a timely basis from third parties. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials, parts or equipment were to increase significantly. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. Any interruption in, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, parts or equipment needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of these products. From time to time, such manufacturers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We have no long-term purchase contracts with any of these manufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer could discontinue supplying to us at any time. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly with us and may in the future choose not to supply products to us. If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, results of operations and financial condition. We are continuing to vertically integrate our business. Key elements of this strategy include continuing to expand the reach of our sales organization, expand our manufacturing capacity, expand our wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, product development, package development and assembly/test operations in Company-owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with our vertical integration strategy, including:  difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limited to, the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities, equipment, employees and inventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;  difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because of the distance from our United States (U.S.) headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;  the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;  less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;  even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we would continue to acquire wafers from our captive manufacturing facilities, which may result in us having higher costs than our competitors;  difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and  difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology. The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wide slowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued vertical integration. If we fail to successfully vertically integrate our business, our ability to compete, profit margins, results of operations and financial condition may suffer. Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies with complementary product lines or customers. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies with complementary product lines, customers or other capabilities. For example, (i) in 2000, we acquired FabTech, Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturing capabilities, (ii) in 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into the analog market, (iii) in 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor, Inc. and (iv) in 2008, we acquired Zetex plc. While we do not currently have any agreements or commitments in place with respect to any material acquisitions, we are in various stages of preliminary discussions, and we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making further acquisitions. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable -14- Table of Contents acquisition candidates, or we may be unable to consummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies or their operations or product lines with our operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not realize all of the benefits we anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include those associated with:  unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;  bringing the acquired companys standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;  coordinating our new product and process development;  hiring additional management and other critical personnel;  increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;  difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;  difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entitys business;  diversion of managements attention from the management of our business; and  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing our products throughout the world. Some of these regulations in the U.S. include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes and regulations. Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. If we were to incur such additional expenses, our product costs could significantly increase, materially affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewater containing residues from our manufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works or sewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may also require discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may be classified as toxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditions for which we could be liable. Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties. Environmental requirements may also limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us to incur additional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected liabilities. Our products may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty claims and product liability claims may be asserted against us, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, results of operations and financial condition. Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a personal computer may be sold for several cents, whereas the computer maker might sell the personal computer for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, we shipped approximately 29 billion, 28 billion and 21 billion individual semiconductor devices in years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to customers around the world, and in the ordinary course of our business, we receive warranty claims and product liability claims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end-products that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we may choose to pay for them to retain a customers business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. Although we currently have liability insurance, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy all possible warranty claims and product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. -15- Table of Contents We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial employees or be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competition for qualified technical and other personnel in China, where our assembly, test and packaging facilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in the semiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing to establish factories and plants in China, and the competition for qualified personnel has increased significantly as a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to maintain our growth or achieve future growth, and any such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to successfully grow our business within the semiconductor industry requires effective planning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place a significant strain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we will need to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage our growth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintain our profit growth or achieve future growth, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and, thus, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If OEMs do not design our products into their applications, our net sales may be adversely affected. We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we design specifically for our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. In addition, a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. Without design wins from OEMs, we would only be able to sell our products to these OEMs as a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product to them. Once an OEM designs another suppliers semiconductors into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that OEMs product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to an OEM. Achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer, and we may be unable to convert design wins into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if, for example, its own products are not commercially successful. We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have credit facilities with financial institutions in the U.S., Asia and Europe, as well as other debt instruments, with interest rates equal to LIBOR or similar indices plus a negotiated margin. A rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense. An increase of 1% in interest rates on our credit facilities would increase our annual interest rate expense by less than $1 million. -16- Table of Contents We may have a significant amount of debt with various financial institutions worldwide. Any indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such debt. We may have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements in our borrowings, including our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. On February 1, 2012, we obtained a three-year term loan in the amount of $40 million with Bank of America, N.A. As of December 31, 2011, we had an aggregate outstanding debt of $8 million and $3 million used for import and export guarantees under our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. In addition, an aggregate amount of $56 million is available for future borrowings under our credit facilities in the U.S., Asia and Europe, and we are permitted under the terms of our debt agreements under various credit facilities to incur substantial additional debt. A significant amount of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:  making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;  resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of an event of default under our secured debt, such as our senior secured credit facility, could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing that debt;  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;  subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under senior secured credit facility;  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt. Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future. On November 25, 2009, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. as subsequently modified, which provides for a $10 million revolving credit facility, a $10 million uncommitted facility and a three-year $40 million term loan for our general corporate purposes. This Credit Agreement contains covenants imposing various restrictions on our business and financial activities. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and undertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business or financial opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolve or merge or consolidate with or into another entity, dispose of certain property, make restricted payments, issue or sell equity interests, engage in other different material lines of business, conduct related party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligations and use proceeds from any credit facility to purchase or carry margin stock or to extend credit to others for the same purpose. The Credit Agreement also requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a quick ratio. Our ability to comply with the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks stated in this section of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. An event of default under the Credit Agreement would permit Bank of America, N.A. to declare all amounts owed under such Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable in full. Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments for the credit facilities and repay the principal amount of the credit facilities. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Debt instruments in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional information. The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Certain of our employees in the U.K., Germany and Taiwan participate in Company sponsored defined benefit plans. The defined benefit plan in the U.K. is closed to new entrants and is frozen with respect to future benefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee. In accounting for these plans, we are required to make actuarial assumptions that are used to calculate the earning value of the related assets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions include the expected return on plan assets, discount rates, and mortality rates. While we believe the underlying assumptions under the projected unit credit method are appropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. -17- Table of Contents Due to the recent fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets, changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plans asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The asset value of our defined benefit plan (the plan) has been volatile over the past year due primarily to wide fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets. The plan assets consist primarily of high quality corporate bonds and stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange and are determined from time to time based on their fair value, requiring us to utilize certain actuarial assumptions for the plans fair value determination. As of December 31, 2011, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately $110 million and the total assets in such plan were approximately $96 million. Therefore, the plan was underfunded by approximately $14 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plan, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan. Any fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets or changes in several key actuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimated return on the plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future funding requirements. In the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions are changed, the funding status of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plan could result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future plan expense and cash contribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In 2009, we adopted a payment scheme with the trustees of the plan in which we paid approximately £1 million GBP every year from 2009 through 2011. We and the trustees are in discussions to extend the payment scheme through 2019. In 2010, we established a joint venture to build a semiconductor facility in Chengdu, China. We are required to contribute at least $48 million to the joint venture during the first three years with additional contributions thereafter, as well as a substantial amount of time and resources to establish and operate the joint venture. Any failure to meet any such requirements, delays or unforeseen circumstances may cause us to incur penalties or require us to contribute additional expenses or resources and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financial conditions. Effective as of September 10, 2010, we entered into an Investment Cooperation Agreement and a Supplementary Agreement to the Investment Cooperation Agreement (collectively, the CDHT Agreements) with the Management Committee of the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone (CDHT) to build a facility in Chengdu, China, with a Chinese local partner, for surface mount component production, assembly and test functions. The CDHT Agreements require us to contribute substantial capital to the joint venture, including at least $48 million in installments during the first three years, as well as time and resources to establish and operate the joint venture. We must obtain various licenses, permissions, certifications and approvals, from time to time, related to the joint ventures business operations. Any failure to meet any such requirements, delays or unforeseen circumstances may cause us to incur penalties, or require us to cease of operations, or contribute additional expenses and/or resources and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financial conditions. As of December 31, 2011, we have invested approximately $25 million of which $18 million were for capital expenditures. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conducts, which may include certain restrictions that may substantially increase the cost of our business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC) or their own codes of conduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety, environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are not requirements under the laws of the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to comply with on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made to any these codes of conduct, and we will have to promptly implement such new provisions or changes, which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement and adversely affect our operational efficiencies and results of operations. If we violate any such codes of conduct, we may lose further business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, we may be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with our customers and suppliers codes of conduct, there can be no assurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits our compliance with such code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss of business from these customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. -18- Table of Contents There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. The risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense in integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing standards, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our new products and process development, the ability to hire additional management and other critical personnel, the ability to increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducing costs, prolonged diversion of our managements attention from the management of our business, the ability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances may make integration slower and more challenging. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill and other intangible assets that may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. which could harm our financial condition and results of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the United States or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations and financial condition. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whether in the United States or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to or through which we ship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials and finished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in China and Germany and our wafer fabrication facilities in Missouri and the U.K., or to our regional sales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results of operations and financial condition. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations. We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located overseas in China. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, net sales to customers outside the U.S. represented 83%, 78% and 83%, respectively, of our net sales. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to our business:  changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including tax laws in the U.S. and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;  compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;  trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;  changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;  difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;  currency exchange rate fluctuations; -19- Table of Contents  restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.;  the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Taiwan and the U.S.;  legal, regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;  longer customer payment terms; and  changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations. We have significant operations and assets in China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations. We have a significant portion of our assets in mainland China, United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in these countries may be adversely affected by changes in those jurisdictions laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our results of operations and financial performance are subject to the economic and political situations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between or among China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of our products or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as to the application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities, resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions. The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the U.S. could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictions and to generate profits. A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. We believe that an increase in demand in China for electronic devices that include our products will be an important factor in our future growth. Although the Chinese economy has grown significantly in recent years, there can be no assurance that such growth will continue. Any weakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devices containing our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in China. In addition, in 2011 33% of our total sales were billed to customers in China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or control prices. Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in China or decrease the demand for our products in China and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdoms Bribery Act 2010 and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the United Kingdoms Bribery Act 2010 (the UK Bribery Act) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that may have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staff concerning FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and related anti-bribery laws. We have established procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. -20- Table of Contents We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations. We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the Chinese Yuan, the Taiwanese dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our income and expenses are based on a mix of currencies and a decline in one currency relative to the other currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, our results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. In the event the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency, we will experience a currency transaction loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact and be increasingly influential to our overall sales, profits and results of operations as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results, especially as the portion of our sales attributable to Europe increases. We do not usually employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures and, therefore, we could experience currency losses as these currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Historically, labor in China has been readily available at a lower cost compared to other countries, and any increase in labor cost in China has been consistent with the projected annual increase in the inflation index and the amount of past labor cost increases. However, because China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available in China at costs consistent with historical levels. Any future increase in labor cost in China is likely to be higher than historical and projected amounts and may occur multiple times in any given year. As a result of experiencing such rapid social, political and economic change, China is also likely to enact new, and/or revise its existing, labor laws and regulations on employee compensation and benefits. These changes in Chinese labor laws and regulations will likely to have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in China. Furthermore, if China workers go on strike to demand higher wages, our operations could be disrupted. Many of our suppliers are currently dealing with labor shortages in China, which may result in future supply delays and disruptions and may drive a substantial increase in their labor costs that is likely to be shared by us in the form of price increases to us. New or revised government labor laws or regulations, strikes or labor shortages could cause our product costs to rise and/or could cause manufacturing partners on whom we rely to exit the business. These events could have a material adverse impact on our product availability and quality, which would affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income. As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we received preferential tax treatment. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Anachip Corp., we also receive preferential tax treatment in Taiwan. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause us not to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which may cause an increase in our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income. The distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be subject to United States income taxes, thus reducing our net income. With the establishment of our holding companies in 2007 and 2011, we intend to permanently reinvest overseas all earnings from foreign subsidiaries. Although we intend to permanently reinvest overseas all earnings, certain unusual circumstances may require us to repatriate funds. This was the case during the first quarter of 2009, in which we repatriated approximately $29 million of accumulated earnings from one of our Chinese subsidiaries, resulting in additional non-cash U.S. federal and state income tax expense of approximately $5 million. As of December 31, 2011, accumulated and undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in China were approximately $212 million, which we consider as a permanent investment. As of December 31, 2011, we have undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations of approximately $265 million (including approximately $33 million of restricted earnings, which are not available for dividends). Additional U.S. federal and state income taxes of approximately $45 million would be required should such earnings be repatriated to the U.S. We may, in the future, plan to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. We may be required to pay U.S. income taxes on these earnings to the extent we have not previously recorded deferred U.S. taxes on such earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our net income in the period in which these earnings are distributed. -21- Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operating results from quarter to quarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability of quarterly results include:  strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;  general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;  seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions;  product obsolescence;  the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;  the cyclical nature of the demand for our customers products;  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;  changes in manufacturing yields;  adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and  the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors. Accordingly, a comparison of our results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningful to investors and our results of operations for any period do not necessarily indicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes in our stock price. We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implement our vertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. While we do not currently have any agreements or commitments in place with respect to any material acquisitions, we are in various stages of preliminary discussions, and we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could:  use a significant portion of our available cash;  issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership;  incur substantial debt;  incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;  incur amortization expenses related to intangibles; and  incur large, immediate accounting write-offs. Such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters. Our directors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 27% of our outstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2011. These stockholders, acting together, will be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations. This control may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. LSC, our largest stockholder, owns approximately 18% (approximately 8 million shares) of our Common Stock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. Raymond Soong, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is the Chairman of LSC, and is the Chairman of Lite-On Technology Corporation, a significant shareholder of LSC. C.H. Chen, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and currently the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, is also Vice Chairman of LSC and Lite-On Technology Corporation. Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, is a member of the Board of Directors of Lite-On Technology Corporation. L.P. Hsu, a member of the Board of Directors since 2007, serves as a consultant to Lite-On Technology Corporation. Several of our directors and executive officers own LSC common stock and hold options to purchase LSC common stock. Service on our Board of Directors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC common stock by our directors and executive officers, could create, or appear to create, actual or potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection -22- Table of Contents with decisions involving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreements we may enter into with LSC. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, LSC accounted for less than 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively, of our net sales. Also, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately 5%, 7% and 6%, respectively, of our net sales were from products manufactured by LSC, making LSC our largest external supplier of discrete semiconductor products. We may have difficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unrelated third party. We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. We have had several transfer agents over the past 50 years. In addition, our early corporate records, including our stock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activities are likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges in accordance with the guidance and rules promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to consummate our business activities. Such means to consummate our business activities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock in large quantities and will subsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders who previously received shares of our Common Stock in such transactions. Any sales in the public market of the newly issued Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. In addition, utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges may encourage short selling because such utilization could depress the price of our Common Stock. Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt. Some provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delaware corporation and an interested stockholder, which is defined as a person who, together with any affiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of the outstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain business combinations between an interested stockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of three years after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless: (i) either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the corporations board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder; (ii) the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation (other than stock held by directors who are also officers or by certain employee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or (iii) the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of 66.66% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. For this purpose, business combinations include mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions of assets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions that would increase the interested stockholders proportionate share ownership in the corporation. -23- Table of Contents Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company. In particular, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directors to render it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.
