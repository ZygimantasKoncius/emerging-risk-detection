ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial condition or operating results in the future to differ significantly from our expected financial condition or operating results that are set forth in the forward looking statements contained in this Report. Set forth below is a summary description of many of those risks and uncertainties.Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets and unfavorable economic conditions generally.The United States recently faced a severe economic crisis, including a major recession from which it is slowly recovering. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the United States remains reduced and many businesses continue 17to experience financial difficulty. The financial markets and financial services industry in particular suffered unprecedented disruption, causing a number of institutions to fail or to require government intervention to avoid failure. As a result of these financial and economic crises, many lending institutions, including us, experienced substantial declines in the performance of their loans in 2008, 2009 and 2010. These loan losses required us to significantly increase our ALL by means of charges to income. The increase in our non-performing loans, coupled with a decrease in loan demand and a decline in net interest margins due to reduced interest rates, resulted in us incurring net losses of $12.0 million, $17.3 million and $14.0 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The economy in Southern California, where the majority of our assets and deposits are generated, was particularly hard hit during this recession. While the general business environment in the region has improved in the past year, there can be no assurance that the environment will continue to improve in the near term. If business and economic conditions begin to decline again, including any continued declines in real estate values, home sale volumes, and financial stress on borrowers, the prolonged economic weakness could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business: •a lack of demand for loans, which would result in a decline in interest income and our net interest margin;•a decline in the value of our loans or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate; •a decrease in deposit balances due to overall reductions in the accounts of customers, which would adversely impact our liquidity position; •an impairment of our investment securities and OREO; and•an increase in the the volume of loans that become delinquent, the number of borrowers that file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their home loans or commercial loan obligations to us, either of which could result in a higher level of non-performing assets and cause us to increase our ALL, thereby reducing our earnings. We could incur losses on the loans we make.Loan defaults and the incurrence of losses on the loans we make are an inherent risk of the banking business. That risk previously had been exacerbated by the significant slowdown in the housing markets and significant increases in real estate loan foreclosures in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties of California where most of our customers are based. This slowdown was attributable to declining real estate prices, excess inventories of unsold homes, high vacancy rates at commercial properties and increases in unemployment and a resulting loss of confidence about the future among businesses and consumers that had combined to adversely affect business and consumer spending. These conditions led to increases in our non-performing assets in in prior periods, which required us to record loan charge-offs and write-downs in the carrying values of real properties that we acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure and caused us to incur losses in those periods. While we have begun to see a recovery in the housing markets including increased real estate prices, lower vacancy rates at commercial properties and continued improvement in unemployment, further weakness in economic conditions could result in additional loan charge-offs and asset write-downs that would require us to increase the provisions we make for loan losses and losses on real estate owned that would have a material adverse effect on our future operating results, financial condition and capital.We may be required to increase our reserve for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) which would adversely affect our financial performance in the future.On a quarterly basis we evaluate and conduct an analysis to estimate the losses inherent in our loan portfolio. However, this evaluation requires us to make a number of estimates and judgments regarding the financial condition of a significant number of our borrowers, the fair value of the properties collateralizing our outstanding loans and economic trends that could affect the ability of borrowers to meet their payment obligations to us. Based on those estimates and judgments, we make determinations, which are necessarily subjective, with respect to (i) the adequacy of our ALLL to provide for write-downs in the carrying values and charge-offs of loans that may be required in the future and (ii) the need to increase the ALLL by means of a charge to income (commonly referred to as the provision for loan and lease losses). If, due to circumstances outside of our control those estimates or judgments prove to have been incorrect or the Bank’s regulators come to a different conclusion regarding the adequacy of the Bank’s ALLL, we would have to increase the provisions we make for loan losses, which would reduce our income or could cause us to incur operating losses in the future.Risks and uncertainties posed by the FRBSF Agreement to which we and the Bank are subject.As previously reported and described in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 31, 2010, we entered into the FRBSF Agreement and the Bank consented to the issuance by the CDBO of a Final Order (the “CDBO Order”), due primarily to the increases in loan losses and other non-performing assets and the net losses we incurred in 2008, 2009 and 2010 and in the first half of 2011. As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2013, on October 31, 182013 the DBO terminated the DBO Order after concluding that the Bank had substantially complied with its terms. Set forth below is a description of material risks and uncertainties created for us by the FRBSF Agreement.We are subject to increased regulatory oversight which increases our costs of doing business and restricts our ability to grow our banking franchise. Under the terms of the FRBSF Agreement, we and the Bank are required to implement certain corrective and remedial measures within strict time frames and to maintain certain levels of liquidity, loan loss reserves and capital. In addition, we are required to increase management oversight of our operations and are subject to more frequent regulatory examinations. These requirements have had and in the future may have the effect of increasing our expenses and adversely affecting our operating results, and restricting our growth.The Bank is restricted from paying dividends to us and we are restricted from paying dividends to our shareholders and from making interest payments on our subordinated debt securities. Dividends from the Bank to us comprise our primary source of funds for paying dividends to our shareholders and paying interest on our junior subordinated debentures (the “Junior Subordinated Debentures”), which we issued in connection with sales of trust preferred securities in 2002 and 2004. Pursuant to the FRBSF Agreement, the Bank may not pay cash dividends to us without the prior approval of the FRBSF and we may not pay cash dividends to our shareholders or interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures. As previously reported, we began to defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Debentures in mid-2010, when we were advised by the FRBSF that it would not approve further interest payments pending an improvement in our operating results and increases in the Bank’s capital and we cannot predict when the FRBSF will permit us to resume such payments. We are permitted to defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters; however, if we are not permitted by the FRBSF to pay the deferred interest and resume making interest payments on a current basis by January 2015, then we would be in default of our obligations under the Junior Subordinated Debentures, in which event the entire $17.5 million principal amount of, and accrued but unpaid interest on, the Junior Subordinated Debentures could be declared immediately due and payable.Failure to satisfy the requirements of the FRBSF Agreement could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and additional restrictions on our business. We are required to maintain the Bank’s capital ratios and continue to meet other requirements under the FRBSF Agreement. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not, the FRBSF could subject us and the Bank to regulatory enforcement actions, which could include the assessment of civil money penalties on us and the Bank, as well as on our directors, officers and other affiliated parties, and impose further restrictions on our business. Any such regulatory actions would increase our operating costs, restrict our ability to grow, make it more difficult for us to recruit officers and directors in the event the need to do so arises in the future, and could result in decreases in our income or cause us to incur losses in the future.Liquidity risk could adversely affect our ability to fund operations and hurt our financial condition.Liquidity is essential to our business, as we use cash to fund loans and investments and other interest-earning assets and deposit withdrawals that occur in the ordinary course of our business. Our principal sources of liquidity include deposits, FHLB borrowings, sales of loans or investment securities held for sale, repayments to the Bank of loans it makes to borrowers and sales of equity securities by us. If our ability to obtain funds from these sources becomes limited or the costs to us of those funds increases, whether due to factors that affect us specifically, including our financial performance or the imposition of regulatory restrictions on us, or due to factors that affect the financial services industry in general, including weakening economic conditions or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, then, our ability to grow our banking business would be adversely affected and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.We face intense competition from other banks and financial institutions that could hurt our business.We conduct our business operations in Southern California, where the banking business is highly competitive and is dominated by large multi-state and in-state banks with operations and offices covering wide geographic areas. We also compete with other financial service businesses, mutual fund companies, and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive banking and financial products and services as well as products and services that we do not offer. The larger banks and many of those other financial institutions have greater financial and other resources that enable them to conduct extensive advertising campaigns and to shift resources to regions or activities of greater potential profitability. They also have substantially more capital and higher lending limits than we do, which enable them to attract larger customers and offer financial products and services that we are unable to offer, putting us at a disadvantage in competing with them for loans and deposits. Increased competition may prevent us (i) from achieving increases, or could even result in decreases, in our loan volume or deposit balances, or (ii) from increasing interest rates on the loans we make or reducing the interest rates we pay to attract or retain deposits, either or both of which could cause a decline in our interest income or an increase in our interest expense and, therefore, lead to reductions in our net interest income and earnings.19Adverse changes in economic conditions in Southern California could disproportionately harm our business.The substantial majority of our customers and the properties securing a large proportion of our loans are located in Southern California, where foreclosure rates and unemployment have remained high relative to most other regions of the country. A downturn in economic conditions or the occurrence of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or fires, which are more common in Southern California than in other parts of the country, could harm our business by:•reducing loan demand which, in turn, would lead to reduced net interest margins and net interest income;•adversely affecting the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to us, which could result in increases in loan losses and require us to make additional provisions for possible loan losses, thereby adversely affecting our operating results or causing us to incur losses; and•causing reductions in real property values that, due to our reliance on real property to collateralize many of our loans, could make it more difficult for us to prevent losses from being incurred on non-performing loans through the foreclosure and sale of such real properties.Our business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.A substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential or “spread” between the interest we earn on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Due to the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, in turn, our profitability. In addition, as a general rule, loan origination volumes are affected by market interest rates. Rising interest rates, generally, are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Conversely, in rising interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may decline and in falling interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may increase. Also, in a rising interest rate environment, we may need to accelerate the pace of rate increases on our deposit accounts as compared to the pace of increases in short-term market rates. Accordingly, changes in market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality and loan origination volume.However, in the current economic environment, loan demand has been relatively weak despite the fact that interest rates are relatively low, due largely to the financial difficulties encountered by prospective borrowers as a result of the economic recession and the weakness of the hoped for economic recovery, the unwillingness of businesses and consumers to borrow due to uncertainties and a lack of confidence about future economic conditions and a tightening of loan underwriting standards by us, as well as other banks and lending institutions, in response to these conditions. As a result, it has become more difficult to predict the impact that changes in interest rates will have on interest rate spreads and on the future financial performance of banks, including our Bank, which has added to the volatility of and adversely affected the stock prices of many banking institutions, including our own. It is also not possible to predict how long these conditions will continue to affect us.We also have adopted an interest rate risk management strategy for the purpose of protecting us against interest rate changes after approval and prior to the funding of mortgage loans and their subsequent sale in the secondary market. Developing an effective interest rate risk management strategy, however, is complex and no risk management strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate changes. Government regulations may impair our operations, restrict our growth or increase our operating costs.We are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and state bank regulatory agencies. The primary objective of these agencies is to protect bank depositors and other customers and consumers and not shareholders, whose respective interests often differ. The regulatory agencies have the legal authority to impose restrictions which they believe are needed to protect depositors and customers of banking institutions, even if those restrictions would adversely affect the ability of the banking institution to expand its business or pay cash dividends, or result in increases in its costs of doing business or hinder its ability to compete with less regulated financial services companies. Additionally, due to the complex and technical nature of many of the government regulations to which banking organizations are subject, inadvertent violations of those regulations may and sometimes do occur. In such an event, we would be required to correct or implement measures to prevent a recurrence of such violations. If more serious violations were to occur, the regulatory agencies could limit our activities or growth or fine us, or ultimately put us out of business in the event we were to encounter severe liquidity problems or a significant erosion of our capital below the minimum amounts required under applicable bank regulatory guidelines.The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act poses uncertainties for our business and is likely to increase our costs of doing business in the future.On July 21, 2010, the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive 20overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act were made effective immediately. However, much of the Dodd-Frank Act is subject to further rulemaking and/or studies. As a result, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, or the resulting rules and regulations, will impact our business and financial performance. Compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, Dodd-Frank permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal law. We cannot predict whether California state agencies will adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level or, if any are adopted, what impact they may have on us, our business or our results of operations.Premiums for federal deposit insurance have increased and may increase even more.The FDIC uses the DIF to cover insured deposits in the event of bank failures, and maintains the DIF by assessing insurance premiums on FDIC-insured banks and depository institutions. The increase in bank failures during the three years ended December 31, 2010 caused the DIF to fall below the minimum balance required by law, forcing the FDIC to raise the insurance premiums assessed on FDIC-insured banks in order to rebuild the DIF. Depending on the frequency and severity of bank failures in the future, the FDIC may further increase premiums or assessments, which would increase our costs of business and could negatively affect our earnings and financial performance in the future.The loss of key personnel could hurt our financial performance.Our success depends to a great extent on the continued availability of our existing management and, in particular, on Steven K. Buster our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas M. Vertin our Commercial Banking Division President. In addition to their skills and experience as bankers, our executive officers provide us with extensive community ties upon which our competitive strategy is partially based. As a result, the loss of the services of any of these officers could harm our ability to implement our business strategy or our future operating results.Our recent exit from the mortgage business could adversely affect our results of operations in the future.Based on a review of our mortgage banking operations, we decided to focus our banking business entirely on our commercial lending business and, therefore, we decided to exit the mortgage banking business on December 9, 2013, in order (i) to redeploy some of our capital resources committed to the mortgage business to our core commercial lending business, (ii) to reduce and control our staffing costs and operating expenses and (iii) to manage and limit interest rate and other risks inherent in the mortgage lending business. We have established reserves totaling $3.8 million in 2013 for our estimate of the costs that will be incurred in winding down this business in the first half of 2014. It may take longer than we expected to complete the wind down of this business and we may incur costs that exceed our estimated cost to wind this operation down. In addition, we could incur costs to repurchase loans pursuant to investor repurchase requests for loans that we made and sold in the secondary market in the past and incur costs to collect those loans that exceed reserves established for such activities, which totaled $1.9 million at December 31, 2013.We rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology from third-party service providers, and we may suffer an interruption in those systems.We rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including our online banking services and data processing systems. Any failure or interruption, or breaches in security, of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, servicing and/or loan origination systems and, therefore, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, interruptions in service and security breaches could lead existing customers to terminate their banking relationships with us and could make it more difficult for us to attract new banking customers.A breach in the security of our systems could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure to us.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication 21and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists or other external parties. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. For example, other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or systems and those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.We are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties which we may acquire.Due to the continued weakness of the U.S. economy and, more specifically, the California economy, including high levels of unemployment and the continuing declines in real estate values, many borrowers have been unable to meet their loan repayment obligations and, as a result, we have had to initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to and take title to an increased number of real properties that had collateralized their loans. Moreover, if the economic conditions remain weak or worsen, we may have to continue to foreclose and take title to additional real properties. As an owner of such properties, we could become subject to environmental liabilities and incur substantial costs for any property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up that may be required due to any environmental contamination that may be found to exist at any of those properties, even though we did not engage in the activities that led to such contamination. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.Managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.Threats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to promoteethical conduct and protect our reputation. However, these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.The price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline, which may make it more difficult to realize a profit on your investment in our shares of common stock.The trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Our stock price in the future could be adversely affected by other factors including:•quarterly fluctuations in our operating results or financial condition;•failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;•the restrictions, described below, on our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock;•the imposition of additional regulatory restrictions on our business and operations or an inability to meet regulatory requirements such as those contained in the FRBSF Agreement;•an inability to resume our growth strategy in the near term or to successfully implement that strategy in the future;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;•fluctuations in the stock prices and operating results of our competitors;•general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry stocks;•proposed or newly adopted legislative or regulatory changes or developments aimed at the financial services industry;22•any future proceedings or litigation that may involve or affect us; and•continuing concerns and a lack of confidence among investors that economic and market conditions will improve.We are currently restricted from paying dividends, and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.Dividends from the Bank will be the principal source of funds available to us to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in the future. However, as described above, pursuant to the FRBSF Agreement, the Bank may not pay cash dividends to us without the prior approval of the FRB and we may not pay cash dividends to our shareholders without the prior approval of the FRB. There is no assurance when those restrictions might be lifted, if at all. Additionally, we and the Bank are subject to additional restrictions which currently and in the future may prevent us from paying cash dividends on our common stock:•As described above, we began deferring interest payments on our Junior Subordinated Debentures in mid-2010. Under the terms of the indentures governing the Junior Subordinated Debentures, we are precluded from paying cash dividends on our common stock or preferred stock unless and until we have paid all of the deferred interest in full and thereafter make interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Debentures as and when they become due.•No dividends may be declared or paid on shares of our common stock unless we first pay dividends to the holders of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock. There is no assurance if or when we will be able to pay such dividends on our preferred stock, however.•California laws also place restrictions on the ability of California corporations to pay cash dividends on preferred or common stock. Subject to certain limited exceptions, a California corporation may pay cash dividends only to the extent of (i) the amount of its retained earnings or (ii) the amount by which the fair value of the corporation’s assets exceeds its liabilities. Although the fair value of our assets exceeded our liabilities at December 31, 2012, due to the restrictions under the FRBSF Agreement which precludes us from paying dividends to shareholders and interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures and the Bank from paying dividends to us, as well as the dividend preference of the holders of our outstanding preferred stock, there is no assurance as to when we might be able to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.Finally, even if the regulatory and other restrictions on the payment of dividends by us and the Bank are lifted and we generate retained earnings in the future, it is our intention to retain cash to increase our capital and fund our operations and the expansion of our banking franchise. As a result, we have no intention to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.Our principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our voting shares and are able to exercise significant influence over our business and have the power to block transactions that could benefit our other shareholders.As a result of our sale of a total of 4,201,278 shares of common stock to Carpenter Community Bancfund, L.P. and Carpenter Community Bancfund-A, L.P. (collectively, the “Carpenter Funds”) in April 2012 and 2,222,222 shares of common stock in March 2013, the Carpenter Funds currently own a total of approximately 34% of our outstanding shares of voting stock and together constitute our largest shareholder. Further, as previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 28, 2012, pursuant to an investor rights agreement entered into with the Carpenter Funds, three individuals designated by the Carpenter Funds have been appointed to serve on the respective Boards of Directors of both the Company and the Bank. In addition, Mr. Curt Christianssen, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, is also Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Carpenter Funds. As a result, the Carpenter Funds have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring approval of our Board of Directors and matters requiring the approval of our shareholders. Consequently, the Carpenter Funds have significant influence over our operations and outcome of shareholder votes on the approval of mergers and acquisitions or changes in corporate control which, among other things, could (i) discourage potential acquirers from attempting to acquire the Company, thereby impeding or preventing the consummation of acquisition or change of control transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, and (ii) make it more difficult for us to sell additional shares at prices in excess of those paid by the Carpenter Funds for their shares of common stock, even if our financial performance significantly improves.If we sell additional shares of our common stock in the future, our shareholders could suffer significant dilution in their share ownership and voting power.Subject to market conditions and other factors, we may determine from time to time to issue additional shares of our common stock or pursue other equity financings to meet capital requirements or support the growth of our business. We have issued, and may continue to issue, stock options, warrants, or other stock grants under our equity incentive plan. It is probable 23that options and or/warrants will be exercised during their respective terms if the stock price exceeds the exercise price of the particular option or warrant. If the options or warrants are exercised, share ownership will be diluted.Share ownership of our common stock will also be diluted from shares issued upon conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock. Additionally, holders of our Series B Convertible 8.4% Preferred Stock (the “Series B Shares”) are entitled to receive dividends payable in cash at a rate of 8.4% per annum if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors. However, the terms of the Series B Shares provide that if, due to legal or regulatory restrictions, we are unable to pay cash dividends on the Series B Shares for two semi-annual dividend periods, we will be required to pay such dividends in shares of our Series C 8.4% Noncumulative Preferred Stock (the “Series C Shares”). Due to dividend restrictions under California law and the FRBSF Agreement, we were precluded from paying cash dividends on the Series B Shares during each of the six month periods ended June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2013. As a result, we issued a total of 5,382 Series C Shares as dividends on our outstanding Series B Shares in 2013. Due to these dividend restrictions, we expect that it will be necessary for us to continue issuing Series C Shares in lieu of cash dividends on the Series B Shares. See “Dividend Policy and Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends” in Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further issuance of any of shares of our common stock and/or preferred stock, including issuances upon conversion or as dividends on our outstanding preferred stock, would dilute the ownership interests of any holders of our common stock at the time of such issuance. Our articles of incorporation permit our Board of Directors to authorize and sell additional shares of preferred stock on terms that could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer that may be beneficial to our shareholders.Our Board of Directors has the power, under our articles of incorporation, to create and authorize the sale of one or more new series of preferred stock without having to obtain shareholder approval for such action. As a result, the Board could authorize the issuance of and issue shares of a new series of preferred stock to implement a shareholders rights plan (often referred to as a “poison pill”) or could sell and issue preferred shares with special voting rights or conversion rights that could deter or delay attempts by our shareholders to remove or replace management, and attempts of third parties to engage in proxy contests and effectuate changes in control of us.Our business may face other risks.Our business and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected in the future by other risks or developments that either are not known to us at the present time or are currently immaterial to our business. Such risks could include, but are not necessarily limited to, unexpected changes in government regulations, the commencement of litigation against us and unexpected adverse changes in local, national or global economic or market conditions.For further discussion of risks that can affect our financial performance or financial condition, also see “Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations” below in this Report.ITEM 1B.
