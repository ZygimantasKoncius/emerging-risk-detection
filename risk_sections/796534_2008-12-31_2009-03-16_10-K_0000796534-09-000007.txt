Item 1A. Risk Factors If the economic downturn is long and severe, our credit risk will increase and there could be greater loan losses. A long and severe recession could result in a higher rate of business closures and increased job losses in the region in which we do business. This would increase the likelihood that more of our customers would become delinquent or default on their loans. A higher level of loan defaults could result in higher loan losses, which could adversely affect our performance. A severe recession could increase the risk of losses in our investment portfolio. We hold both corporate and municipal bonds in our investment portfolio. A prolonged recession could increase the risk of default by both corporate and government issuers. If the real estate market is depressed for an extended period, our business could be negatively affected. A depressed real estate market can impact us in several ways. First, the demand for new real estate loans will decline, and existing loans may become delinquent. In addition, if there is a general devaluation in real estate, loan collateral values will decline. If market interest rates rise, our net interest income can be negatively affected in the short term. The direction and speed of interest rate changes affect our net interest margin and net interest income. In the short term, rising interest rates may negatively affect our net interest income, because our interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits) reprice sooner than our interest-earning assets (generally loans). If more competitors come into our market area, our business could suffer. The financial services industry in our market area is highly competitive, with a number of commercial banks, credit unions, insurance companies and stockbrokers seeking to do business with our customers. If there is additional competition from new business or if our existing competitors focus more attention on our market, we could lose customers and our business could suffer. Increased governmental involvement in and scrutiny of financial institutions could lead to a significant increase in our regulatory burden. Because of problems in the financial services sector, both federal and state governments could enact new regulations. A significant increase in our regulatory burden could have a negative effect on profitability. 7 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments There are none.
