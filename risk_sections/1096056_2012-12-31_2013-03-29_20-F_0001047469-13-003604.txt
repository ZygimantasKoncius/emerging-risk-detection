D. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following risk factors described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes, before investing in our American Depositary Shares ("ADSs"). The risks and uncertainties described below are those significant risk factors, currently known and specific to us that we believe are relevant to an investment in our securities. If any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, the price of the ADSs could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we now deem immaterial may also harm us and adversely affect your investment in the ADSs. Risks Relating to Our Operations We depend on certain end-markets, including the automotive, self-contained breathing apparatus, aerospace, defense, medical and industrial gas end-markets, and an economic downturn in any of those end-markets could reduce sales. We have significant exposures to certain key end-markets, including some end-markets that are cyclical in nature. To the extent that any of these cyclical end-markets are in decline or at a low point in their economic cycle, sales may be adversely affected and thereby negatively affect our ability to fund our business operations and service our indebtedness. It is possible that all or most of these end-markets could be in decline at the same time, such as during a recession, which could significantly harm our financial condition and result of operations due to decreased sales. For example, 26% of our 2012 sales were related to automotive end-markets, 12% to self-contained breathing apparatus ("SCBA"), 13% to the aerospace and defense markets, 10% to medical markets (including portable oxygen) and 9% to the printing and paper markets. Together, these five markets accounted for approximately 70% of our 2012 revenues. Dependence of either of our divisions on certain end-markets is even more pronounced. For example, in 2012, excluding rare earth surcharges, 22% of the Elektron division's sales were to customers in the automotive end-market, which slumped in 2009 and although global automotive production has since improved, European production fell again in 2012 and remains depressed. Our global operations expose us to economic conditions, political risks and specific regulations in the countries in which we operate, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We derive our revenues and earnings from operations in many countries and are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We have wholly-owned facilities in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the Czech Republic and China and joint venture facilities in India, South Korea and Japan. Doing business in foreign countries has risks, including the potential for adverse changes in the local political, financial or regulatory climate, difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations, and the costs of complying with a variety of laws and regulations. Because we have operations in many countries, we are also liable to pay taxes in many fiscal jurisdictions. The tax burden on us depends on the interpretation of local tax regulations, bilateral or multilateral international tax treaties and the administrative doctrines in each one of these jurisdictions. Changes in these tax regulations could have an impact on our tax burden. 5 Table of Contents Moreover, the principal markets for our products are located in North America, Europe and Asia, and any financial difficulties experienced in these markets may have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The maturity of some of our markets, particularly the U.S. medical oxygen cylinder market and the European fire extinguisher market, could require us to increase sales in developing regions, which may involve greater economic and political risks. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to expand sales in these regions. Our operations rely on a number of large customers in certain areas of our business, and the loss of any of our major customers could negatively impact our sales. If we fail to maintain our relationships with our major customers, or fail to replace lost customers, or if there is reduced demand from our customers or for the products produced by our customers, it could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could experience a reduction in sales if any of our customers fail to perform or default on any payment pursuant to our contracts with them. Long-term relationships with customers are especially important for suppliers of intermediate materials and components, where we often work closely with customers to develop products that meet particular specifications as part of the design of a product intended for the end-user market, and the bespoke nature of many of our products could make it difficult to replace lost customers. Our top ten customers accounted for 36% of our revenue in 2012. Competitive pressures can materially and adversely affect our sales, profit margins, financial condition and results of operations. The markets for many of our products are now increasingly global and highly competitive, especially in terms of quality, price and service. We could lose market share as a result of these competitive pressures, which could materially and adversely affect our sales, profit margins, financial condition and results of operations. Because of the highly competitive nature of some of the markets in which we operate, we may have difficulty raising customer prices to offset increases in costs of raw materials. For example, the U.S. medical oxygen cylinder market has a number of dedicated producers with excess capacity, making it very difficult for us to raise customer prices to offset aluminum cost increases. In addition, rising aluminum prices could lead to the development of alternative products that use lower cost materials, which could become favored by end-market users. More generally, we may face potential competition from producers that manufacture products similar to our aluminum-, magnesium- and zirconium-based products using other materials, such as steel, plastics, composite materials or other metals, minerals and chemicals. Products manufactured by competitors using different materials might compete with our products in terms of price, weight, engineering characteristics, recyclability or other grounds. Other parts of our operations manufacture and sell products that satisfy customer specifications. Competitors may develop lower cost or better-performing products and customers may not be willing to pay a premium for the advantages offered by our products, even if they are technically superior to competing technologies. In recent years, we have also experienced increased competition from new geographic areas, including Asia, where manufacturers can benefit from lower labor costs. Competitors with operations in these regions may be able to produce goods at a lower cost than us, enabling them to compete in terms of price. Competition with respect to less complex zirconium chemicals has been particularly intense, with Chinese suppliers providing low cost feedstock to specialist competitors, making it especially difficult to compete in commodity products such as paint drying additives. Chinese magnesium also continues to be imported into Europe in large volumes, which may impact our competitive position in Europe regarding certain magnesium 6 Table of Contents alloys. We are also impacted by Western-based competitors that have chosen to relocate production to Asia to take advantage of lower labor costs. In addition, governments may impose import and export restrictions, grant subsidies to local companies and implement tariffs and other trade protection regulations and measures that may give competitive advantages to certain of our competitors and adversely affect our business. We depend upon our larger suppliers for a significant portion of our raw materials, and a loss of one of these suppliers or a significant supply interruption could negatively impact our financial performance. If we fail to maintain relationships with key suppliers or fail to develop relationships with other suppliers, it could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We rely, to varying degrees, on major suppliers for some of the principal raw materials of our engineered products, including aluminum, zirconium and carbon fiber. For example, in 2012, we obtained approximately 70% of our aluminum, the largest single raw material purchased by the Gas Cylinders division, from Rio Tinto Alcan and its associated companies. Moreover, demand for carbon fiber is increasing rapidly, leading to occasional periods of short supply in recent years, with a number of expanding applications competing for the same supply of this specialized raw material. We currently purchase most of our carbon fiber from Toray and Grafil, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Chemical. We generally purchase raw materials from suppliers on a spot basis, under standard terms and conditions. We are half-way through a two-year supply contract with Rio Tinto Alcan for a portion of our aluminum requirements. We also have a five-year magnesium supply contract for a portion of our magnesium requirements with U.S. Magnesium that expires on December 31, 2014. Other than under 'force majeure' conditions, neither Rio Tinto Alcan nor U.S. Magnesium may terminate the respective contracts other than as a result of our breach of the terms. We have made efforts to build close commercial relationships with key suppliers to meet growing demand for our products. However, an interruption in the supply of essential materials used in our production processes, or an increase in the prices of materials due to market shortages, government quotas or natural disturbances, could significantly affect our ability to provide competitively priced products to customers in a timely manner, and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event of a significant interruption in the supply of any materials used in our production processes, or a significant increase in their prices (as we have experienced, for example, at different times with aluminum, magnesium and rare earths), we may have to purchase these materials from alternative sources, build additional inventory of the raw materials, increase our prices, reduce our profit margins or possibly fail to fill customer orders by the deadlines required in contracts. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to obtain replacement materials quickly on similar terms or at all. We are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials that are used to manufacture our products, and such fluctuations in raw material prices could lead us to incur unexpected costs and could affect our margins or our results of operations. The primary raw material used in the manufacturing of gas cylinders and superformed panels is aluminum. The price of aluminum is subject to both short-term price fluctuations and to longer-term cyclicality as a result of international supply and demand relationships. Aluminum prices have increased significantly in recent years, with the London Metal Exchange ("LME") three-month price of aluminum increasing from an average of $1,701 per metric ton in 2009; $2,198 per metric ton in 2010; and $2,419 per metric ton in 2011 before falling back to $2,049 per metric ton in 2012. We have also experienced significant price increases in other raw material costs such as primary magnesium, carbon fiber, zircon sand and rare earths. For example, starting in mid-2010, Chinese authorities greatly reduced the export quota for rare earths, which resulted in an increase in the price of cerium carbonate, priced in rare earth oxide contained weight, from $10 per kilogram in May 2010 to a peak of $270 per kilogram in July 2011. By the end of 2011, the 7 Table of Contents price of cerium carbonate had decreased to approximately $80 per kilogram. The decrease in the price continued throughout 2012, so that by December 2012 the price was approximately $28 per kilogram. See "Item 4.B. Business Overview". Fluctuations in the prices of these raw materials could affect margins in the businesses in which we use them. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review." We cannot always pass on price increases or increase our prices to offset increases in raw material immediately or at all, whether because of fixed price agreements with customers, competitive pressures that restrict our ability to pass on cost increases or increase prices, or other factors. It can be particularly difficult to pass on price increases or increase prices in product areas such as gas cylinders, where competitors offer similar products made from alternative materials, such as steel, if those materials are not subject to the same cost increases. As a result, a substantial increase in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In such an event, there might be less cash available than necessary to fund our business operations effectively or to service our indebtedness. In addition, higher prices necessitated by large increases in raw material costs could make our current, or future, products unattractive compared to competing products made from alternative materials that have not been so affected by raw material cost increases or compared to products produced by competitors who have not incurred such large increases in their raw material costs. Historically, we have used derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposures to fluctuations in aluminum prices. Currently, our main method of hedging against this risk is to agree to forward prices with our largest supplier of aluminum log for manufacturing gas cylinders and to agree to some fixed pricing for up to twelve months from more specialist sheet suppliers to our Superform business. We also use LME-based derivative contracts to supplement our fixed price agreement strategy. Although it is our treasury policy to enter into these transactions only for hedging, and not for speculative purposes, we are exposed to market risk and credit risk with respect to the use of these derivative financial instruments. If the price of aluminum were to continue to rise, our increased exposure to changes in aluminum prices could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations to the extent that we cannot pass price increases on to our customers or manage exposure effectively through hedging instruments. See "Item 11. Quantitative & Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." In addition, if we have hedged our metal position, and have forward price agreements, a fall in the price of aluminum might give rise to hedging margin calls to the detriment of our borrowing position. In the past few years, when appropriate, we have made additional purchases of large stocks of magnesium and some rare earth chemicals to delay the impact of potentially higher prices in the future. However, these strategic purchases increase our working capital needs, reducing our liquidity and cash flow and potentially resulting in an increased drawdown on our revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). We are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of utilities that are used in the manufacture of our products, and such fluctuations in utility prices could lead us to incur unexpected costs and could affect our margins or our results of operations. Our utility costs, which constitute another major input cost of our total expenses and include costs related to electricity, natural gas, and water, may be subject to significant variations. In recent years, the emergence of financial speculators in energy, increased taxation and other factors have contributed to a significant increase in utility costs for us, particularly with respect to the price that we pay for our U.K. energy supplies, which have been subject to a number of significant price increases. Fluctuations in the prices of these utility costs could affect margins in the businesses in which we use them. We cannot always pass on price increases or increase our prices to offset increases in utility costs immediately or at all, whether because of fixed price agreements with customers, competitive pressures that restrict our ability to pass on cost increases or increase prices, or other factors. It can be particularly difficult to pass on price increases or increase prices in product areas such as gas cylinders, where competitors offer similar products made from alternative materials, such as steel, if those materials are not subject to the same cost increases. As a result, a substantial increase in utility costs could have a material 8 Table of Contents adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In such an event, there might be less cash available than necessary to fund our business operations effectively or to service our indebtedness. Changes in foreign exchange rates could reduce margins on our sales, reduce the reported revenues of our non-U.S. operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We conduct a large proportion of our commercial transactions, purchases of raw materials and sales of goods in various countries and regions, including the United Kingdom, United States, continental Europe, Australia and Asia. Our manufacturing operations based in the United States, continental Europe and Asia, usually sell goods denominated in their main domestic currency, but our manufacturing operations in the United Kingdom purchase raw materials and sell products often in currencies other than pound sterling. Changes in the relative values of currencies can decrease the profits of our subsidiaries when they incur costs in currencies that are different from the currencies in which they generate all or part of their revenue. These transaction risks principally arise as a result of purchases of raw materials in U.S. dollars, coupled with sales of products to customers in euros. This impact is most pronounced in our exports to continental Europe from the United Kingdom. In 2012, our U.K. operations sold approximately €47.4 million of goods into the euro zone. Our policy is to hedge a portion of our net exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates with forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Therefore, we are exposed to market risk and credit risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. Any failure of hedging policies could negatively impact our profits, and thus damage our ability to fund our operations and to service our indebtedness. In addition to subsidiaries in the United States, we have subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Canada and China, as well as joint ventures in Japan, South Korea and India, whose revenue, costs, assets and liabilities are denominated in local currencies. Because our consolidated accounts are reported in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to fluctuations in those currencies when those amounts are translated for purposes of reporting our consolidated accounts, which may cause declines in results of operations as results denominated in different currencies are translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The largest risk is from our operations in the United Kingdom, which in 2012 generated operating profits of $24.0 million from sales revenues of $167.2 million. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling, can have a material effect on our consolidated income statement and balance sheet. In 2012 the strengthening of the average U.S. dollar had a negative impact on revenues of $6.2 million while in 2011 the weakening of the average U.S. dollar exchange rate had a positive impact on reported revenues of $9.9 million. Changes in translation exchange rates in 2012 increased net assets by $2.9 million and reduced net assets by $5.5 million in 2011. For additional information on these risks and the historical impact on our results see "Item 11. Quantitative & Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk." Our defined benefit pension plans have significant funding deficits and are exposed to market forces that could require us to make increased ongoing cash contributions in response to changes in market conditions, actuarial assumptions and investment decisions and that could expose us to significant short-term liabilities if a wind-up trigger occurred in relation to such plans, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have defined benefit pension arrangements in the United Kingdom, the United States and France. See "Note 30" of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements attached to this Annual Report. Our largest defined benefit plan, the Luxfer Group Pension Plan, which closed to new members in 1998 but remains open for accrual of future benefits based on career-average salary, is funded according to the regulations in effect in the United Kingdom and, as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, had an IAS 19 accounting deficit of $76.8 million and $58.5 million, respectively. Luxfer Group Limited is the principal employer under the Luxfer Group Pension Plan, and other U.K. subsidiaries also participate under the plan. Our other defined benefit plans are less significant than the Luxfer Group Pension Plan and, as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, had an IAS 19 accounting deficit of $19.9 million and 9 Table of Contents $23.9 million, respectively. The largest of these additional plans is the BA Holdings, Inc. Pension Plan in the United States, which was closed to further benefit accruals in December 2005. According to the actuarial valuation of the Luxfer Group Pension Plan as at April 5, 2012, the Luxfer Group Pension Plan had a deficit of £49.9 million on the plan specific basis. Should a wind-up trigger occur in relation to the Luxfer Group Pension Plan, the buy-out deficit of that plan will become due and payable by the employers. The aggregate deficit of the Luxfer Group Pension Plan on a buy-out basis was estimated at £140 million as at April 5, 2012. The trustees have the power to wind-up the Luxfer Group Pension Plan if they consider that in the best interests of members there is no reasonable purpose in continuing the Luxfer Group Pension Plan. We are exposed to various risks related to our defined benefit plans, including the risk of loss of market value of the plan assets, the risk of actual investment returns being less than assumed rates of return, the trustees of the Luxfer Group Pension Plan switching investment strategy (which does require consultation with the employer) and the risk of actual experience deviating from actuarial assumptions for such things as mortality of plan participants. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates cause changes in the annual cost and benefit obligations. As a result of the actuarial valuation as at April 5, 2012, we are required to make increased ongoing cash contributions, over and above the normal contributions required to meet the cost of future accrual, to the Luxfer Group Pension Plan. These additional payments are intended to reduce the funding deficit. We have agreed with the trustees to a schedule of payments to reduce the deficit. This schedule has been provided to the UK Pensions Regulator (the "Pensions Regulator"), and we are waiting for their confirmation of the payment scheme. The schedule of payments provides for minimum annual contributions of £3.4 million per year, together with additional variable contributions based on one-fifth of net earnings of Luxfer Holdings PLC in excess of £12 million. The total contributions are subject to an annual cap of £5 million. These contribution rates are to apply until the deficit is eliminated (expected to take between ten and 12 years, depending on the variable contributions), but in practice the schedule will be reviewed, and may be revised, following the next actuarial valuation. There is a limited ability to delay payments in the event of another severe economic downturn. Increased regulatory burdens have also proven to be a significant risk, such as the United Kingdom's Pension Protection Fund ("PPF") Levy, which was $1.6 million in 2012. Following closure of the defined benefit plans described above, we have offered new employees membership in defined contribution pension arrangements or 401(k) arrangements, and these do not carry the same risks to the company as the defined benefit plans. The Pensions Regulator in the United Kingdom has power in certain circumstances to issue contribution notices or financial support directions which, if issued, could result in significant liabilities arising for us. The Pensions Regulator may issue a contribution notice to the employers that participate in the Luxfer Group Pension Plan or any person who is connected with or is an associate of these employers where the Pensions Regulator is of the opinion that the relevant person has been a party to an act, or a deliberate failure to act, which had as its main purpose (or one of its main purposes) the avoidance of pension liabilities or where such act has a materially detrimental effect on the likelihood of payment of accrued benefits under the Luxfer Group Pension Plan being received. A person holding alone or together with his or her associates directly or indirectly one-third or more of our voting power could be the subject of a contribution notice. The terms "associate" and "connected person," which are taken from the Insolvency Act 1986, are widely defined and could cover our significant shareholders and others deemed to be shadow directors. If the Pensions Regulator considers that a plan employer is "insufficiently resourced" or a "service company" (which have statutory definitions), it may impose a financial support direction requiring it or any member of the Group, or any person associated or connected with an employer, to put in place financial support in relation to the Luxfer Group Pension Plan. Liabilities imposed under a contribution notice or financial support direction may be up to the difference between the value of the assets of the Luxfer Group Pension Plan and the cost of buying out the benefits of members and other beneficiaries of the Luxfer Group Pension Plan. In practice, the risk of a contribution notice being imposed may restrict our 10 Table of Contents ability to restructure or undertake certain corporate activities. Additional security may also need to be provided to the trustees of the Luxfer Group Pension Plan before certain corporate activities can be undertaken (such as the payment of an unusual dividend) and any additional funding of the Luxfer Group Pension Plan may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations. Our ability to remain profitable depends on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property, and any failure to protect and enforce such intellectual property could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot ensure that we will always have the ability to protect proprietary information and our intellectual property rights. We protect our intellectual property rights (within the United States, Europe and other countries) through various means, including patents and trade secrets. For example, most of our sales of automotive catalysis products are now subject to patent protection and new product developments such as the smartflow regulator are patent protected. In particular, we patent products and processes (or certain parts of them) that could also be easily duplicated, while protecting other products and most of our processes as trade secrets. Because of the difference in foreign trademark, patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in other countries as they would in the United States or the United Kingdom. The patents we own could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our patents, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our patents will only be protected for the duration of the patent. The minimum amount of time remaining in respect to any of our material patents is three years (which relates to certain patents used in our gas cylinder business). With respect to our unpatented proprietary technology, it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we could be materially adversely affected. We rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. Expiration or termination of our right to use certain intellectual property granted by third parties, the right of those third parties to grant the right to use the same intellectual property to our competitors and the right of certain third parties to use certain intellectual property used as part of our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have negotiated, and may from time to time in the future negotiate, licenses with third parties with respect to third-party proprietary technologies used in certain of our manufacturing processes and products. If any of these licenses expires or terminates, we will no longer retain the rights to use the relevant third-party proprietary technologies in our manufacturing processes and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, the rights granted to 11 Table of Contents us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Some of our patents may cover inventions that were conceived or first reduced to practice under, or in connection with, government contracts or other government funding agreements or grants. With respect to inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such government funding agreements, a government may retain a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the relevant country the invention throughout the world. In addition, if we fail to comply with our reporting obligations or to adequately exploit the developed intellectual property under these government funding agreements, the relevant country may obtain additional rights to the developed intellectual property, including the right to take title to any patents related to government funded inventions or to license the same to our competitors. Furthermore, our ability to exclusively license or assign the intellectual property developed under these government funding agreements to third parties may be limited or subject to the relevant government's approval or oversight. These limitations could have a significant impact on the commercial value of the developed intellectual property. We often enter into research and development agreements with academic institutions where they generally retain certain rights to the developed intellectual property. The academic institutions generally retain rights over the technology for use in non-commercial academic and research fields, including in some cases the right to license the technology to third parties for use in those fields. It is difficult to monitor and enforce such noncommercial academic and research uses, and we cannot predict whether the third party licensees would comply with the use restrictions of these licenses. We could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights against such licensees. In addition, even though the rights that academic institutions obtain are generally limited to the noncommercial academic and research fields, they may obtain rights to commercially exploit developed intellectual property in certain instances. Furthermore, under research and development agreements with academic institutions, our rights to intellectual property developed thereunder is not always certain, but instead may be in the form of an option to obtain license rights to such intellectual property. If we fail to timely exercise our option rights and/or we are unable to negotiate a license agreement, the academic institution may offer a license to the developed intellectual property to third parties for commercial purposes. Any such commercial exploitation could adversely affect our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business. If third parties claim that intellectual property used by us infringes upon their intellectual property, our operating profits could be adversely affected. We may, from time to time, be notified of claims that we are infringing upon patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties, and we cannot provide assurances that other companies will not, in the future, pursue such infringement claims against us or any third-party proprietary technologies we have licensed. If we were found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property right, or if we failed to obtain or renew a license under a patent or other intellectual property right from a third party, or if a third party that we are licensing technologies from was found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property rights of another third party, we may be required to pay damages, suspend the manufacture of certain products or reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible, or we may be unable to enter certain new product markets. Any such claims could also be expensive and time consuming to defend and divert management's attention and resources. Our competitive position could suffer as a result. In addition, if we have omitted to enter into a valid non-disclosure or assignment agreement for any reason, we may not own the invention or our intellectual property and may not be adequately protected. 12 Table of Contents Any failure of our research and development activity to improve our existing products and develop new products could cause us to lose market share and impact our financial position. Our products are highly technical in nature, and in order to maintain and improve our market position, we depend on successful research and development activity to continue to improve our existing products and develop new products. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient research and development capability to respond to changes in the industries in which we operate. These changes could include changes in the technological environment in which we currently operate, increased demand for new products or the development of alternatives to our products. For example, the development of lighter-weight steel alloys has made the use of steel in gas cylinders a more competitive alternative to aluminum than it had been previously. In addition, our superformed aluminum components compete with new high-performance composite materials developed for use in the aerospace industry. Without the timely introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products, our products could become obsolete over time, in which case our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In our efforts to develop and market new products and enhancements to our existing products, we may fail to identify new product opportunities successfully or develop and timely bring new products to market. We may also experience delays in completing development of, enhancements to or new versions of our products. In addition, product innovations may not achieve the market penetration or price stability necessary for profitability. In addition to benefiting from our research collaboration with universities, we spent $8.9 million, $11.1 million and $9.8 million (including revenue and capital items but before funding grants received) in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, on our own research and development activities. We expect to fund our future capital expenditure requirements through operating profit cash flows and restricted levels of indebtedness, but if operating profit decreases, we may not be able to invest in research and development or continue to develop new products or enhancements. Some of our key operational equipment is relatively old and may need significant capital expenditures for repair or replacement. High levels of maintenance and repair costs could result from the need to maintain our older plants, property and equipment, and machinery breakdowns could result in interruptions to the business causing lost production time and reduced output. Machinery breakdowns or equipment failures may hamper or cause delays in the production and delivery of products to our customers and increase our operating costs, thus reducing cash flow from operations. Any failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer relationships and reputation. We already incur considerable expense on maintenance, including preventative maintenance, and repairs. Any failure to implement required investments, whether because of requirements to divert funds to repair existing physical infrastructure, debt service obligations, unanticipated liquidity constraints or other factors, could have a material effect on our business and on our ability to service our indebtedness. The breakdown of some of our older equipment, such as the large hot rolling mill at our Madison, Illinois plant, could be difficult to repair and would be very costly should it need to be replaced. Our operations may prove harmful to the environment, and any clean-up or other related costs could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. We are exposed to substantial environmental costs and liabilities, including liabilities associated with divested assets and prior activities performed on sites before we acquired an interest in them. Our operations, including the production and delivery of our products, are subject to a broad range of continually changing environmental laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations increasingly impose more stringent environmental protection standards on us and affect, among other things, air emissions, waste-water discharges, the use and handling of hazardous materials, noise levels, waste disposal practices, soil and groundwater contamination and environmental clean-up. Complying with these regulations involves significant and recurring costs. We have spent 13 Table of Contents approximately $2.7 million between 2010 and 2012 on environmental remediation efforts including investigations at the Redditch, United Kingdom, site of our closed tubes plant, and a landfill at our Swinton, United Kingdom site. We estimate that improvement activities and environmental compliance at these and other sites will cost $1.8 million in 2013. See "Item 4.B. Business Overview" for details of our environmental management program and the environmental issues that we are currently addressing. We cannot predict our future environmental liabilities and cannot assure investors that our management is aware of every fact or circumstance regarding potential liabilities or that the amounts provided and budgeted to address such liabilities will be adequate for all purposes. In addition, future developments, such as changes in regulations, laws or environmental conditions, may increase environmental costs and liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and consolidated financial position in any given financial year, which could negatively affect our cash flows and hinder our ability to service our indebtedness. The health and safety of our employees and the safe operation of our businesses is subject to various health and safety regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations impose various obligations on us, including the provision of safe working environments and employee training on health and safety matters. Complying with these regulations involves recurring costs. Certain of our operations are highly regulated by different agencies, which require products to comply with their rules and procedures and can subject our operations to penalties or adversely affect production. Certain of our operations are in highly regulated industries, which require us to maintain regulatory approvals and, from time to time, obtain new regulatory approvals from various countries. This can involve substantial time and expense. In turn, higher costs reduce our cash flow from operations. For example, manufacturers of gas cylinders throughout the world must comply with high local safety and health standards and obtain regulatory approvals in the markets where they sell their products. In addition, military organizations require us to comply with applicable government regulations and specifications when providing products or services to them directly or as subcontractors. In addition, we are required to comply with U.S. and other export regulations with respect to certain products and materials. The European Union has also passed legislation governing the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals, known as REACH, pursuant to which we are required to register chemicals and gain authorization for the use of certain substances. Although we make reasonable efforts to obtain all the licenses and certifications that are required by countries in which we operate, there is always a risk that we may be found not to comply with certain required procedures. This risk grows with increased complexity and variance in regulations across the globe. Because the regulatory schemes vary by country, we may also be subject to regulations of which we are not presently aware and could be subject to sanctions by a foreign government that could materially and adversely affect our operations in the relevant country. Governments and their agencies have considerable discretion to determine whether regulations have been satisfied. They may also revoke or limit existing licenses and certifications or change the laws and regulations to which we are subject at any time. If our operations fail to obtain, experience delays in obtaining or lose a needed certification or approval, we may not be able to sell our products to our customers, expand into new geographic markets or expand into new product lines, which will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, new or more stringent regulations, if imposed, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations because we may experience difficulty or incur significant costs in connection with compliance with them. Non-compliance with these regulations could result in administrative, civil, financial, criminal or other sanctions against us, which could have negative consequences on our business and financial position. Furthermore, as we begin to operate in new countries, we may need to obtain new licenses, certifications and approvals. 14 Table of Contents New and pending legislation or regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Although we are working to improve our energy efficiency, our manufacturing processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers, are still energy intensive and use or generate, directly or indirectly, greenhouse gases. Political and scientific debates related to the impacts of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on the global climate are ongoing. In recent years, new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA") rules, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme in the United Kingdom, each of which regulates greenhouse gas emissions from certain large industrial plants, have come into effect. While the ultimate impact of the new greenhouse gas emissions rules on our business is not yet known, it is possible that these new rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition because of the costs of compliance and the impact of the legislation on energy costs. Additional regulation or legislation aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions, such as a "cap-and-trade program," is currently being considered, or has been adopted, by several states in the United States and globally. Such regulation or legislation, if adopted or enacted in a more demanding form, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Because of the nature and use of the products that we manufacture, we may in the future face large liability claims. We are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, which could be costly to us and which may arise in the future. We are exposed to possible claims for personal injury, death or property damage, which could result from a failure of a product manufactured by us or of a product integrating one of our products. For example, improperly manufactured gas cylinders could explode at high pressure, which can cause substantial personal and property damage. We also supply many components into aerospace applications, where the potential for significant liability exposures necessitates additional insurance costs. Many factors beyond our control could lead to liability claims, including: The failure of a product manufactured by a third party that incorporated components manufactured by us; The reliability and skills of persons using our products or the products of our customers; and The use by customers of materials or products that we produced for applications for which the material or product was not designed. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: Decreased demand for our products; Reputational injury; Initiation of investigation by regulators; Costs to defend related litigation; Diversion of management time and resources; Compensatory damages and fines; Product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; Loss of revenue; Exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and A decline in our stock price. We could be required to pay a material amount if a claim is made against us that is not covered by insurance or otherwise subject to indemnification, or that exceeds the insurance coverage that we maintain. 15 Table of Contents Moreover, we do not currently carry insurance to cover the expense of product recalls, and litigation involving significant product recalls or product liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our businesses could suffer if we lose certain of our employees or cannot attract and retain qualified employees. We rely upon a number of key executives and employees, particularly Brian Purves, our CEO, and other members of the executive management board. If these and certain other employees ceased to work for us, we would lose valuable expertise and industry experience and could become less profitable. In addition, future operating results depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified engineering and technical personnel. As a result of intense competition for talent in the market, we cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel. While our key employees are generally subject to non-competition agreements for a limited period of time following the end of their employment, if we were to lose the services of key executives or employees, it could have an adverse effect on operations, including our ability to maintain our technological position. We do not carry "key-man" insurance covering the loss of any of our executives or employees. Any expansion or acquisition may prove risky. As part of our strategy, we have and may continue to supplement organic growth by acquiring companies or operations engaged in similar or complementary businesses. If the consummation of acquisitions and integration of acquired companies and businesses diverts too much management attention from the operations of our core businesses, operating results could suffer. Any acquisition made could be subject to a number of risks, including: Failing to discover liabilities of the acquired company or business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator, including environmental costs and liabilities; Difficulties associated with the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired company or business; The loss of key personnel in the acquired company or business; and A negative impact on our financial statements resulting from an impairment of acquired intangible assets, the creation of provisions or write-downs. We cannot ensure that every acquisition will ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated. We also face certain challenges as a result of organic growth. For example, in order to grow while maintaining or decreasing per unit costs, we will need to improve efficiency, effectively manage operations and employees and hire enough qualified technical personnel. We may not be able to adequately meet these challenges. Any failure to do so could result in costs increasing more rapidly than any growth in sales, thus resulting in lower operating income from which to finance operations and indebtedness. In addition, we may need to borrow money to complete acquisitions or finance organic growth, which will increase our debt service requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future on favorable terms or at all. We could suffer a material interruption in our operations as a result of unforeseen events or operating hazards. Our production facilities are located in a number of different locations throughout the world. Any of our facilities could suffer an interruption in production, either at separate times or at the same time, because of various and unavoidable occurrences, such as severe weather events (e.g., hurricanes, floods and earthquakes), from casualty events (e.g., explosions, fires or material equipment breakdown), from acts of terrorism, from pandemic disease, from labor disruptions or from other events (e.g., required maintenance 16 Table of Contents shutdowns). For example, a severe hailstorm caused extensive damage to glazed panels at our Madison, Illinois plant in 2012, and our operations in California are subject to risks related to earthquakes. In addition, some of our products are highly flammable, and there is a risk of fire inherent in their production process. For example, in 2010, two furnaces were destroyed in a fire at our Madison, Illinois plant. Certain residents of the area near the plant have filed claims against us in relation to nuisance allegedly resulting from the fire, and we have responded to these claims. In addition, the Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint against us in 2010 in relation to this incident that we have been responding to since then. Such hazards could cause personal injury or death, serious damage to or destruction of property and equipment, suspension of operations, substantial damage to the environment and/or reputational harm. The risk is particularly high in the production of fine magnesium powders, which are highly flammable and explosive in certain situations. Similar disruptions in the operations of our suppliers or customers could materially affect our business and operations. Although we carry certain levels of business interruption insurance, the coverage on certain catastrophic events or natural disasters, including earthquakes, a failure of energy supplies and certain other events, is limited, and it is possible that the occurrence of such events may have a significant adverse impact on our business and, as a result, on our cash flows. Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations. Our business depends on a large number of employees who are members of various trade union organizations. Strikes or labor disputes with our employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. We cannot assure you that there will not be any strike, lock-out or material labor dispute in the future. Work interruptions or stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We could incur future liability claims arising from previous businesses now closed or sold. We previously operated Baco Contracts, a building cladding contracting business, and although the business has been closed for many years, the warranties on several of the business' contracts have several years remaining, thereby exposing us to continuing potential liabilities. As a holding company, our main source of cash is distributions from our operating subsidiaries. We, Luxfer Holdings PLC, conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our main cash source is dividends from these subsidiaries. The ability of each subsidiary to make distributions depends on the funds that a subsidiary has from its operations in excess of the funds necessary for its operations, obligations or other business plans. Since our subsidiaries are wholly-owned by us, our claims will generally rank junior to all other obligations of the subsidiaries. If our operating subsidiaries are unable to make distributions, our growth may slow after the proceeds of this offering are exhausted, unless we are able to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the event of a subsidiary's liquidation, there may not be assets sufficient for us to recoup our investment in the subsidiary. Our failure to perform under purchase or sale contracts could result in the payment of penalties to customers or suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition. A failure to perform under purchase or sale contracts could result in the payment of penalties to suppliers or customers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Certain contracts with suppliers could also obligate us to purchase a minimum product volume (clauses known as "take or pay") or contracts with customers may impose firm commitments for the delivery of certain quantities of products within certain time periods. The risk of incurring liability under a "take-or-pay" supply contract would be increased during an economic crisis, which would increase the likelihood of a sharp drop in demand for our products. 17 Table of Contents We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making or, in the case of the U.K. Bribery Act, receiving, improper payments to, or from, government officials or, in the case of the U.K. Bribery Act, third parties, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failing to prevent bribery is also an offence under the U.K. Bribery Act. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. Despite our compliance program, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless, negligent or improper acts committed by our employees or agents. The costs of violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, make payments on our indebtedness, pay dividends and respond to changes in our business or take certain actions. As of December 31, 2012, we had $65 million of indebtedness on a consolidated basis under our senior notes due 2018 (the "Loan Notes due 2018"). We also have a Revolving Credit Facility which as at December 31, 2012 was not utilized. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy obligations with respect to indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under agreements governing our indebtedness. Further, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of available cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. Our indebtedness could also limit our ability to operate our business, including the ability to engage in strategic transactions or implement business strategies. Factors related to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business and our results of operations. Furthermore, our interest expense could increase if interest rates rise because certain portions of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do. In addition, the agreements that govern the terms of our indebtedness contain, and any future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants imposing significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including: Incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; Pay dividends (including to fund cash interest payments at different entity levels), or make redemptions, repurchases or distributions, with respect to ordinary shares or capital stock; Create or incur certain security interests; Make certain loans or investments; Engage in mergers, acquisitions, amalgamations, asset sales and sale and leaseback transactions; and Engage in transactions with affiliates. These restrictive covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. 18 Table of Contents We may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur new indebtedness, the related risks, including those described above, could intensify. Absence of a liquid trading market for the ADSs or ordinary shares. Our ADSs have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since our initial public offering in October 2012. During the post-IPO lock-up period, however, the trading volume has been low, and we cannot predict at this time if our ADSs will trade more actively in the market. The low liquidity could make it difficult for you to sell your ADSs. In addition, the market price of the ADSs may be volatile. The factors below may have a material effect on the market price of the ADSs: Fluctuations in our results of operations; Negative publicity; Changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our company, the sectors in which we operate, the securities market generally and conditions in the financial markets; Regulatory developments affecting our industry; Announcements of studies and reports relating to our products or those of our competitors; Changes in economic performance or market valuations of our competitors; Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results; Conditions in the industries in which we operate; Announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic relations, joint ventures or capital commitments; Additions to or departures of our key executives and employees; Fluctuations of exchange rates; Release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ordinary shares or ADSs; and Sales or perceived sales of additional shares of the ADSs. During recent years, securities markets in the United States and worldwide have experienced significant volatility in prices and trading volumes. This volatility could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the ADSs, irrespective of our results of operations and financial condition. Substantial future sales of the ADSs in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the price of the ADSs to decline. Additional sales of our ordinary shares or ADSs in the public market after this offering, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of the ADSs to decline. A large percentage of our ordinary shares outstanding will become available for sale upon the expiration of a lock-up period related to our initial public offer, which we expect will expire at midnight on April 1, subject to volume and other restrictions as applicable under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. When the lock-up period expires, if these shares are sold into the market, the market price of the ADSs could decline. 19 Table of Contents Our ability to pay regular dividends on our ordinary shares is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, applicable laws and other factors, and may be limited by our structure and statutory restrictions and restrictions imposed by the Revolving Credit Facility and Notes due 2018 as well as any future agreements. We may declare cash dividends on our ordinary shares as described in "Item 8, Financial Information." However, the payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Any recommendation by our board to pay dividends will depend on many factors, including our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, applicable laws and other factors. In addition, our Revolving Credit Facility and Loan Notes due 2018 limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on our shares, and in the future we may become subject to debt instruments or other agreements that further limit our ability to pay dividends. Under English law, any payment of dividends would be subject to the Companies Act 2006 of England and Wales (the "Companies Act"), which requires, among other things, that we can only pay dividends on ordinary shares out of profits available for distribution determined in accordance with the Companies Act. Additionally, any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our ADSs. You may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting materials in time to be able to exercise your right to vote. Holders of the ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares evidenced by the ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of the ADSs will instead appoint the depositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs. You may not receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote, and it is possible that you, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote. You may be subject to limitations on the transfer of your ADSs. Your ADSs, which may be evidenced by American depositary receipts ("ADRs"), are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of your ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary think it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law, government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from a number of rules under the U.S. securities laws and are permitted to file less information with the Securities and Exchange Commission than a U.S. company. This may limit the information available to holders of the ADSs. We are a "foreign private issuer," as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") rules and regulations and, consequently, we are not subject to all of the disclosure requirements applicable to companies organized within the United States. For example, we are exempt from certain rules under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that regulate disclosure obligations and procedural requirements related to the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations applicable to a security registered under the Exchange Act. In addition, our officers and directors are exempt from the reporting and "short-swing" profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules with respect to their purchases and sales of our securities. Moreover, we are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. public 20 Table of Contents companies. Accordingly, there may be less publicly available information concerning our company than there is for U.S. public companies. As a foreign private issuer, we are not subject to certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance rules applicable to U.S. listed companies. We rely on a provision in the New York Stock Exchange's Listed Company Manual that allows us to follow English corporate law and the Companies Act with regard to certain aspects of corporate governance. This allows us to follow certain corporate governance practices that differ in significant respects from the corporate governance requirements applicable to U.S. companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. For example, we are exempt from New York Stock Exchange regulations that require a listed U.S. company, among other things, to: Have a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors; Require non-management directors to meet on a regular basis without management present; Establish a nominating and compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors; Adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees; and Promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers that should address certain specified items. Although formally exempt from these requirements, we do adopt several features as a matter of good corporate governance, including having a majority of independent non-executive directors on the board and having audit and remuneration committees composed entirely of independent non-executive directors. In accordance with our New York Stock Exchange listing, our Audit Committee is required to comply with the provisions of Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, both of which are also applicable to New York Stock Exchange-listed U.S. companies. Because we are a foreign private issuer, however, our Audit Committee is not subject to additional New York Stock Exchange requirements applicable to listed U.S. companies, including: An affirmative determination that all members of the Audit Committee are "independent," using more stringent criteria than those applicable to us as a foreign private issuer; The adoption of a written charter specifying, among other things, the audit committee's purpose and including an annual performance evaluation; and The review of an auditor's report describing internal quality-control issues and procedures and all relationships between the auditor and us. Furthermore, the New York Stock Exchange's Listed Company Manual requires listed U.S. companies to, among other things, seek shareholder approval for the implementation of certain equity compensation plans and issuances of common stock. We may lose our foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses. We are a "foreign private issuer," as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, and, therefore, we are not required to comply with all the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and related rules and regulations. Under Rule 405, the determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to us on June 30, 2013. There is a risk that we will lose our foreign private issuer status. 21 Table of Contents In the future, we would lose our foreign private issuer status if, for example, more than 50% of our assets are located in the United States and we continue to fail to meet additional requirements necessary to maintain our foreign private issuer status. The regulatory and compliance costs to us under U.S. securities laws as a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly more than costs we incur as a foreign private issuer. If we are not a foreign private issuer, we will be required to file periodic reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which are more detailed and extensive in certain respects than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. We would be required under current SEC rules to prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and modify certain of our policies to comply with corporate governance practices associated with U.S. domestic issuers. Such conversion and modifications will involve additional costs. In addition, we may lose our ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements on U.S. stock exchanges that are available to foreign private issuers such as the ones described above and exemptions from procedural requirements related to the solicitation of proxies. If we fail to establish or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our shares may, therefore, be adversely impacted. We are subject to reporting obligations under U.S. securities laws. Our reporting obligations as a public company place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. Our management and our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in preparation for which we will need to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting. Prior to our initial public offering on October 3, 2012, we were an unlisted public company and therefore not subject to the regulations and corporate governance requirements applicable to NYSE-listed companies .We have been implementing a number of measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting in order to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements. Although we have not, using our current procedures, identified any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies relating to our internal controls over financial reporting, we have not yet fully implemented a system of internal controls over financial reporting that complies with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We do not currently have a full-time internal audit function. We intend to implement measures to improve our internal controls over financial reporting to meet the deadline imposed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the filing of our annual report on Form 20-F in respect of fiscal year 2013. If we fail to timely implement, and maintain the adequacy of, our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the market price of the ADSs or ordinary shares. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Finally, on April 5, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act"). The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including an exemption from the requirement to comply with the auditor attestation 22 Table of Contents requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will remain an emerging growth company up to the last day of the fifth fiscal year following the date of the offering, although (i) if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31; (ii) if our annual gross revenues are $1 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the last day of such fiscal year; and (iii) if during any three-year period before that time we issue an aggregate of over $1 billion in non-convertible debt, we would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the date of such issuance. It may be difficult to effect service of U.S. process and enforce U.S. legal process against the directors of Luxfer. Luxfer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. A number of our directors and officers reside outside of the United States, principally in the United Kingdom. A substantial portion of our assets, and the assets of such persons, are located outside of the United States. Therefore, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States upon Luxfer or these persons in order to enforce judgements of U.S. courts against Luxfer or these persons based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgements of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities solely based on the U.S. federal securities laws. 23 Table of Contents
