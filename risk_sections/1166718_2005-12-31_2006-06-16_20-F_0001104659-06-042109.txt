D. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Financial 90 ConditionCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our ability to borrow, invest and engage in various activities, which could impair our ability to expand or finance our future operations. Debt Our debt consists of notes, bank loans and vendor financing for property, plant and equipment, of which approximately 86% are at fixed rates. The following table summarizes our debt position at December 31, 2005 and 2004: At December 31, 2005 At December 31, 2004 (in thousands) Long-tem debt, including current portion: Notes $ 304,024 $ 201,709 Bank loans $ 5,647 $ 8,056 Vendor financing $ 42,421 $ 55,849 Total $ 352,092 $ 265,614 Short-term debt $ 19,554 $ 17,554 Total debt(1) $ 371,646 $ 283,168 Denominated in: U.S. dollars $ 180,689 $ 192,186 Euro $ 15,081 $ 21,462 Rubles $ 175,876 $ 69,520 (1) In December 2005, we raised approximately $104.2 million through the issuance of non-convertible ruble denominated notes partly in order to redeem in April 2006 approximately $49.8 million of non-convertible ruble denominated notes issued in April 2003. Our debt matures as follows: Year (in thousands) 2006 88,940 2007 13,520 2008 158,053 2009 6,172 2010 and thereafter 104,961 Notes Wimm-Bill-Dann Ruble Notes On December 21, 2005, we issued five-year, 3,000,000 non-convertible ruble denominated notes at a face value of 1,000 rubles each. The offering raised a total of approximately $104.2 million at the exchange rate as of December 31, 2005. The notes are redeemable by us on December 15, 2010. The issue was priced at par with a coupon of 9%. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears commencing on June 21, 2006. Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods U.S. Dollar Notes On May 21, 2003, UBS (Luxembourg) S.A. issued 8.5% Loan Participation Notes due 2008 for the sole purpose of funding a $150,000,000 loan (the Loan) to us. The Loan will mature on May 21, 2008 and bears interest at an annual rate of 8.5%, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 21 and November 21 of each year. Ten of our subsidiaries unconditionally, irrevocably, jointly and severally guarantee our obligation under the Loan. The loan agreement contains a number of covenants including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios. 91 Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods Ruble Notes On April 15, 2003, Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods issued 1,500,000 non-convertible ruble denominated notes at a face value of 1,000 rubles each guaranteed by Vitafrukt, one of our juice subsidiaries. The offering raised a total of 1,500,000 thousand rubles ($52.1 million at the exchange rate as of December 31, 2005 of which $2.3 million had been repaid as at December 31, 2005). Interest was payable semi-annually in arrears commencing on October 14, 2003, and the interest rate for each coupon period was based on the Consumer Price Index, published by Goskomstat of the Russian Federation. The interest rates for the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth coupon periods were 12.9%, 11.98%, 9.38%, 8.48%, 10.78% and 11.24%, respectively. The notes were redeemable by Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods on April 11, 2006 and we redeemed the remaining outstanding notes on this date. Bank Loans Substantially all of our long-term bank loans at December 31, 2005 consisted of euro and U.S. dollar-denominated loans from International Moscow Bank, Sberbank and ING Bank (Eurasia), at interest rates ranging from 5.69% to 6.17%. Our short-term debt balance at December 31, 2005 mainly consisted of ruble-denominated loans from Alfa-bank, the Moscow City Government and Sberbank at interest rates ranging from 3.67% to 9.33%. Vendor Finance We have agreements with suppliers of equipment which provide financing for periods ranging from 1 to 9 years. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our vendor financing obligations totaled $29.7 million and $40.4 million, respectively; euro 10.1 million and euro 10.7 million (equivalent to $11.9 million and $14.5 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004), respectively; and 23.2 million rubles and 26.3 million rubles (equivalent to $0.8 million and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004), respectively. This financing is provided at interest rates of LIBOR plus 1.5%, EURIBOR plus 1.5% and 16.0% for U.S. dollar, euro and ruble-denominated contracts, respectively. The majority of equipment financing is provided by one supplier, Tetra Pak. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, property, plant and equipment amounting to $40.4 million and $59.7 million, respectively, served as collateral under these financing agreements. Cash Flows A summary of our cash flows from continuing operations is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Cash provided by operating activities $ 113,937 $ 71,720 $ 29,940 Cash used in investing activities (125,157 ) (73,808 ) (95,142 ) Cash provided (used in) by financing activities 82,619 (16,159 ) 73,399 Impact of exchange rate differences on cash and cash equivalents (2,087 ) 1,774 2,727 Net increase (decrease) in cash 69,312 (16,473 ) 10,924 Cash paid for acquisition of property, plant and equipment $ (72,805 ) $ (67,804 ) $ (91,974 ) Cash paid for acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired (24,964 ) (6,697 ) (7,002 ) Vendor financed acquisitions of property, plant and equipment 5,709 7,336 12,899 In 2005, we financed our capital expenditures and acquisitions exclusively with operating cash flows. 92 We spent $125.1 million on our investment activities in 2005, including acquisitions of property, plant and equipment of $72.8 million, acquisitions of subsidiaries of $25.0 million, investments in direct financing leases of $2.0 million and other investment activities of $0.1 million, offset by $0.5 million proceeds from disposal of investments and $6.0 million proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment. We also invested temporary free cash proceeds from issued notes in short-term bank deposits in the amount of $31.8 million. Vendor financed acquisitions of property, plant and equipment totaled $5.7 million in 2005 compared to $7.3 million in 2004 because of an overall reduction in our vendor financed capital expenditures, including the improvement of packaging facilities. Instead, we are shifting our capital expenditures towards construction and installation projects, which are typically not vendor-financed. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was $113.9 million, compared with $71.7 million in 2004. The increase in 2005 was due to profitable growth and better management of our working capital, including a reduction of tax receivables balance. Working Capital Our short-term demands for liquidity, including seasonal fluctuations in working capital requirements, are met by cash flows from operations and short-term debt. At December 31, 2005, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $93.1 million, of which $91.9 million were ruble-denominated and $1.2 million were euro and U.S. dollar-denominated. Our working capital balance was $199.9 million. Our working capital position at December 31, 2005 increased compared to $164.0 million at December 31, 2004, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments which reflected the deposit of a portion of the proceeds from our ruble-denominated notes issued on December 12, 2005. We used cash to repay our ruble notes redeemable on April 11, 2006. We believe that our working capital is sufficient for our present requirements. Taxes receivable decreased by $24.1 million to $61.5 million as of December 31, 2005 from $85.6 million as of December 31, 2004. Taxes receivable represents VAT due from the state budget. The decrease at December 31, 2005 was primarily due to our recovery of certain VAT receivables from the state budget for previous years. Under existing tax legislation, we are able to offset this VAT against income taxes and other taxes payable to the state budget and to recover from the state budget. We are taking all legally available steps, including filing litigation claims, to facilitate the recovery of taxes receivable from the state budget. In 2005, $31.9 million in VAT tax was recovered from the state budget in cash and $5.3 million was recovered by an offset. We also received $0.5 million from the tax authorities as penalties. Trade accounts payable increased to $65.8 million at December 31, 2005 from $62.4 million at December 31, 2004. Trade payables turnover averaged 24 days as of December 31, 2005 and 27 days as of December 31, 2004. Trade receivables decreased from $62.2 million as of December 31, 2004 to $60.0 million as of December 31, 2005 after the allowance for bad debts of $5.1 million, as compared to $13.9 million as of December 31, 2004. Trade receivables turnover averaged 16 days as of December 31, 2005 and 19 days as of December 31, 2004. Inventory increased from $102.0 million as of December 31, 2004 to $130.6 million as of December 31, 2005. Turnover of inventory in days as of December 31, 2005 amounted to 56 days, as compared to 49 days as of December 31, 2004. The increase in inventory levels was partly due to an increase in our stock of raw milk held to balance out seasonality. 93 Credit Rating Discussion Our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, and the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of factors, including our operating cash flows, total debt outstanding, commitments, interest requirements, liquidity needs and availability of liquidity. Other factors considered may include our business strategy, the condition of our industry and our position within the industry. Although we understand that these and other factors are among those considered by the rating agencies, each agency might calculate and weigh each factor differently. Our credit ratings as of the date of this document are as follows: Rating Agency Companys rating Long-Term Debt Rating Outlook/Watch Moodys(1) B1 B2 positive Standard & Poors(2) B+ B+ stable (1) Rated on May 31, 2006. (2) Rated on August 24, 2005. The loan agreement relating to our $150 million loan participation notes due 2008 contains provisions requiring, subject to certain conditions, our prepayment of the loan in full in the event that a change in control or merger results in a decline in our credit ratings. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require the application of managements most challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments that are sufficiently sensitive to give materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our most critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. Estimates and assumptions The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Examples include estimates of provisions for bad and doubtful accounts, obsolete inventory, and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts is established if there is objective evidence that we will not be able to collect the amounts due according to original contractual terms and reduces receivables to amounts expected to be collected. In estimating uncollectible amounts, we consider factors such as current overall economic conditions, industry-specific economic conditions, historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance. Our provisions cover individual balances where there is evidence that losses are probable as at the balance sheet date. We use significant judgment in estimating uncollectible amounts. While we believe our processes effectively address our exposure for doubtful accounts, changes in the economy, industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 94 Accounting for Income Taxes We assess the temporary differences resulting from differential treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We assess our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis by assessing our valuation allowance and adjusting the valuation allowance appropriately. In calculating our valuation allowance we consider the future taxable incomes and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives. If we estimate that the deferred tax asset cannot be realized at the recorded value, a valuation allowance is created with a charge to the statement of income in the period in which such assessment is made. Inventory Valuation We review our inventory balances to determine if inventories can be sold at amounts equal to or greater than their carrying amounts. The review includes identification of slow moving inventories, obsolete inventories, expired inventories and discontinued products or lines of products. The identification process includes historical performance of the inventory, current operational plans for the inventory, as well as industry and customer specific trends. Obsolete items are provided or written off. If our actual results differ from our expectations with respect to the selling of our inventories at amounts equal to or greater then their carrying amounts, we would be required to adjust our inventories accordingly. Depreciation periods for property, plant and equipment Depreciation periods of property, plant and equipment are based on estimated useful lives of related assets. The adoption of depreciation periods requires judgment in determining appropriate estimated useful lives over which the related assets will be utilized. In estimating useful lives, we consider factors such as our historical experience and the industry, manufacturers estimates, anticipated use and our maintenance policies. As these factors change, management estimates may change and we could be required to reassess depreciation periods for property, plant and equipment and consider impairment. Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets When events and circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset (group) may not be recoverable, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to derive from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (group). If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (group), we would then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset (group) over the estimate of its recoverable amount, which is the higher of either fair market value or value in use. We carry out the impairment test for property, plant and equipment and goodwill when indicators exist. For purposes of determining goodwill recognition, we perform a review for possible impairment of goodwill at least on an annual basis at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill, we would then calculate the impairment loss as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its implied fair value, which is to be recognized in same manner as the amount of goodwill is recognized in a business combination. Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Statement No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of the Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4. The amendments made by Statement 151 clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. 95 The guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after November 23, 2004. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS Statement No. 151 is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions (APB No. 29), is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in APB No. 29, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. SFAS No. 153 amends APB No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. These provisions of SFAS No. 153 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date SFAS No. 153 was issued. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which is a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. In addition, SFAS No. 154 requires that a change in method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The impact of the adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 154 is currently not known because no such accounting changes are anticipated. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, which amends FASB Statements No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. This Statement resolves issues addressed in Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. SFAS No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of Statement 133, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation and clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives. SFAS No. 155 amends Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. These provisions of SFAS No. 155 are effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 96 C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. We invest significant financial and human resources in new product development, focusing on long-term strategic development projects that are expected to create innovative products and technologies. As of December 31, 2005, our product and technologies development departments located at Lianozovo Dairy Plant had 41 employees and our new juice product and quality department at the Ramenskiy Plant had 31 employees. These departments often cooperate with third parties such as Russian research institutions, specialized research firms and suppliers. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we spent approximately $1.3 million, $0.6 million and $1.2 million on activities associated with new product development. For a more detailed discussion of new product development see 
