ITEM 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that our management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that our management is not aware of or focused on or that they currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations. This report is qualified 6 Table of Contents in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Intense competition exists in the gaming industry and we expect competition to continue to intensify. The gaming industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous casinos and casino hotels of varying quality and size in market areas where our properties are located. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses and could compete with any new forms of gaming that may be legalized in the future. The casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably by their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity. In most markets, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas. In some markets, we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas. In recent years, with fewer new markets opening for development, competition in existing markets has intensified. We have invested in expanding existing facilities, developing new facilities, such as South Coast Hotel and Casino, and acquiring established facilities in existing markets, such as our acquisition of Coast Casinos, Inc. in July 2004 and Sams Town Shreveport in May 2004. In addition, our competitors have also invested in expanding their existing facilities and developing new facilities. This expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we compete, and this intense competition can be expected to continue. If our competitors operate more successfully, if competitors properties are enhanced or expanded, or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct business, we may lose market share. In particular, the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands. A proliferation of Native American gaming in areas located near our properties, or in areas in or near those from which we draw our customers, could have an adverse effect on our operating results. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, a federally recognized Native American tribe, announced its intention to begin construction on a land-based gaming operation near New Buffalo, Michigan (which is located approximately fifteen miles from Blue Chip) in mid-2006 and to open the facility in mid-2007. If their facility is constructed and begins operations, it could have a material adverse impact on the operations of Blue Chip. Our expansion, development and renovation projects may face significant risks inherent in construction projects or implementing a new marketing strategy, including receipt of necessary government approvals. We regularly evaluate expansion, development and renovation opportunities. On January 4, 2006, we announced our planned redevelopment of the property located on the Las Vegas Strip on which the Stardust and our executive offices are presently located into a new resort complex, which will be the largest and most expensive development project we have undertaken to date. We recently opened a new property, the South Coast, in Las Vegas, Nevada. A second hotel tower at South Coast is under construction and is scheduled to open in the second quarter of 2006. A limited partnership in which we are the general partner and have a 90% ownership interest submitted gaming applications seeking selection to apply for a gaming license for a potential future casino entertainment facility near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Borgata is nearing completion of a public space expansion and recently began construction of a new hotel tower and spa. These projects and any other development projects we may undertake will be subject to the many risks inherent in the expansion or renovation of an existing enterprise or construction of a new enterprise, including unanticipated design, construction, regulatory, environmental and operating problems and lack of demand for our projects. Our current and future projects could also experience:  shortages of materials;  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages;  unforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems;  weather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses; and  unanticipated delays and cost increases. 7 Table of Contents Our anticipated costs and construction period for projects are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects and contractors. The cost of any project may vary significantly from initial expectations, and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns. If we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis, the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate funding is available. The completion dates of any of our projects could also differ significantly from expectations for construction-related or other reasons. We cannot assure you that any project will be completed, if at all, on time or within established budgets, or that any project will result in increased earnings to us. Significant delays, cost overruns, or failures of our projects to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our projects may not help us compete with new or increased competition in our markets. Certain permits, licenses and approvals necessary for some of our current or anticipated projects have not yet been obtained. The scope of the approvals required for expansion, development or renovation projects can be extensive and may include gaming approvals, state and local land-use permits and building and zoning permits. Unexpected changes or concessions required by local, state or federal regulatory authorities could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled openings of the facilities. We may not receive the necessary permits, licenses and approvals or obtain the necessary permits, licenses and approvals within the anticipated time frame. In addition, although we design our projects for existing facilities to minimize disruption of existing business operations, expansion and renovation projects require, from time to time, portions of the existing operations to be closed or disrupted. In particular, our Echelon Place project will require the razing of the Stardust. Any significant disruption in operations could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face risks associated with growth and acquisitions. As part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities. We also pursue expansion opportunities, including joint ventures, in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming. The expansion of our operations, whether through acquisitions, development or internal growth could divert managements attention and could also cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal, professional and consulting fees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses for our new projects or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved. If we are unable to finance our expansion, development and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures through cash flow, borrowings under our bank credit facility and additional financings, our expansion, development and renovation efforts will be jeopardized. We intend to finance our current and future expansion, development and renovation projects, as well as our other capital expenditures, primarily with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our bank credit facility and equity or debt financings. If we are unable to finance our current or future expansion, development and renovation projects, or our other capital expenditures, we will have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expansion, development and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners, or modifying our bank credit facility. These sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion, development and renovation projects, and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion, development and renovation projects and other capital expenditures, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not ultimately successful in dismissing the action filed against our Treasure Chest Casino property, we may potentially lose our ability to operate the Treasure Chest Casino property and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Alvin C. Copeland is the sole shareholder of an entity that applied in 1993 for a riverboat license at the location of our Treasure Chest Casino. Copeland was unsuccessful in the application process and has made several attempts to have the Treasure Chest license revoked and awarded to his company. In 1999, Copeland filed a direct action against Treasure Chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of Treasure Chests license, an award of the license to him and monetary damages. The suit was dismissed by the trial court citing that Copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The dismissal was appealed by Copeland to the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal. In 2002, the First Circuit 8 Table of Contents Court of Appeal reversed the trial courts decision and remanded the matter to the trial court. In 2003, we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was denied. The Court of Appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss. In May 2004, we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds, which motions are currently pending. It is not possible to determine the likely date of trial, if any, at this time. We intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit. If this matter ultimately results in the Treasure Chest license being revoked, it would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to extensive governmental gaming regulation and taxation policies, which may harm our business. We are subject to a variety of regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulatory authorities at the federal, state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines and take other actions, any one of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals are introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and our company. Legislation of this type may be enacted in the future. The federal government has also previously considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future. In addition, gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. If there is any material increase in state and local taxes and fees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our directors, officers and key employees must also be approved by certain state regulatory authorities. If state regulatory authorities were to find a person occupying any such position unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person. Certain public and private issuances of securities and certain other transactions by us also require the approval of certain state regulatory authorities. In addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and our operating results. Certain of our facilities are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions. Certain of our facilities are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes. Extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas. For example, our Treasure Chest Casino, which is located near New Orleans, Louisiana, suffered minor damage and was closed for 44 days in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and has since reopened with limited hours of operation and limited food and beverage outlets. Additionally, our Delta Downs Racetrack Casino & Hotel, which is located in southwest Louisiana, suffered significant property damage and closed for 42 days in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Rita, and has since reopened with limited hours of operation and limited food and beverage outlets. Horse races at Delta Downs are scheduled to resume in April 2006. While we maintain insurance that may cover some of the costs we incur as a result of some extreme weather conditions, our coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions, including claims we have submitted in connection with the damage sustained at our Delta Downs property. We did not submit insurance claims in connection with the hurricane damage sustained by our Treasure Chest property in part because the amount of property damage did not exceed our insurance deductible. If these or any of our other properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted as a result of extreme weather in the future, or if extreme weather adversely impacts general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our riverboats and dockside facilities are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure and regulatory compliance. In addition to being in areas that are often subject to extreme weather conditions, gaming operations conducted on riverboat casinos or at dockside facilities could be lost from service for a variety of reasons, including casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure or extended or extraordinary maintenance. 9 Table of Contents We currently conduct our Treasure Chest, Par-A-Dice, Blue Chip and Sams Town Shreveport gaming operations on riverboats. Each of our riverboats must comply with U.S. Coast Guard requirements as to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety. Each riverboat must hold a Certificate of Inspection for stabilization and flotation, and may also be subject to local zoning codes. The U.S. Coast Guard requirements establish design standards, set limits on the operation of the vessels and require individual licensing of all personnel involved with the operation of the vessels. Loss of a vessels Certificate of Inspection or American Bureau of Shipping approval would preclude its use as a casino. U.S. Coast Guard regulations require a hull inspection for all riverboats at five-year intervals. Under certain circumstances, extensions may be approved. The U.S. Coast Guard may require that such hull inspections be conducted at a U.S. Coast Guard-approved dry-docking facility, and if so required, the travel to and from such docking facility, as well as the time required for inspections of the affected riverboats, could be significant. To date, the U.S. Coast Guard has allowed in-place inspections of our riverboats. The U.S. Coast Guard may not allow these types of inspections in the future. The loss of a dockside casino or riverboat casino from service for any period of time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. U.S. Coast Guard regulations also require us to prepare and follow certain security programs. In 2004, we implemented the American Gaming Associations Alternative Security Program at our riverboat casinos and dockside facilities. The American Gaming Associations Alternative Security Program is specifically designed to address riverboat casinos and their respective dockside facilities maritime security requirements. Changes to these regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We draw a significant percentage of our customers from limited geographic regions. Events adversely impacting the economy or these regions, including terrorism, may also impact our business. Our California Hotel and Casino, Fremont Hotel and Casino and Main Street Station Casino, Brewery and Hotel draw a substantial portion of their customers from the Hawaiian market. For the year ended December 31, 2005, patrons from Hawaii comprised approximately 70% of the room nights sold at the California, 61% at the Fremont and 59% at Main Street Station. An increase in fuel costs or transportation prices, a decrease in airplane seat availability, or a deterioration of relations with tour and travel agents, particularly as they affect travel between the Hawaiian market and our facilities, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our Las Vegas properties also draw a substantial number of customers from certain other specific geographic areas, including Southern California, Arizona, Las Vegas and the Midwest. Native American casinos in California and other parts of the United States have diverted some potential visitors away from Nevada, which has had and could continue to have a negative affect on Nevada gaming markets. In addition, due to our significant concentration of properties in Nevada, any terrorist activities or disasters in or around Nevada, or the areas from which we draw customers for our Las Vegas properties, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Each of our other properties located outside of Nevada depends primarily on visitors from their respective surrounding regions and are subject to comparable risk. The outbreak of public health threats at any of our properties or in the areas in which they are located, or the perception that such threats exist, as well as adverse economic conditions that affect the national or regional economies, whether resulting from war, terrorist activities or other geopolitical conflict, weather or other factors, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that the airline industry is negatively impacted due to the outbreak of war, public health threats, terrorist or similar activity, increased security restrictions or the publics general reluctance to travel by air, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected. Energy price increases may adversely affect our cost of operations and our revenues. Our casino properties use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy. In addition, our Hawaiian air charter operation uses a significant amount of jet fuel. While no shortages of energy or fuel have been experienced to date, substantial increases in energy and fuel prices in the United States have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect, our operating results. The extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases, but this impact could be material. In addition, energy and gasoline price increases in cities that constitute a significant source of customers for our properties could result in a decline in disposable income of potential customers and a corresponding decrease in visitation and spending at our properties, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 10 Table of Contents Certain of our stockholders own large interests in our capital stock and may significantly influence our affairs. William S. Boyd, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with his immediate family, beneficially owned approximately 35% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2005. Michael J. Gaughan, the Chief Executive Officer of Coast Casinos, Inc., a subsidiary of Boyd Gaming, owned approximately 17% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2005. As a result, the Boyd family and/or Mr. Gaughan have the ability to significantly influence our affairs, including the election of our directors and, except as otherwise provided by law, approving or disapproving other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including a merger, consolidation or sale of assets. Some of our hotel casinos are located on leased property. If we default on one or more leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we may lose possession of the affected hotel casino. We lease certain parcels of land on which The Orleans Hotel and Casino, Suncoast Hotel and Casino, Sams Town Tunica, Treasure Chest Casino and Sams Town Shreveport are located. In addition, we lease other parcels of land on which portions of California and Fremont are located. If we were to default on any one or more of these leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land, including the hotel-casinos. This would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities. Leverage and Debt Service We have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2005, we had total consolidated long-term debt, less current maturities, of approximately $2.6 billion. We expect that our long-term indebtedness will substantially increase in connection with the capital expenditures we anticipate making as a results of our planned expansion, development and renovation projects. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example it could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness;  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and  limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a significant adverse effect on us. In addition, the interest rates on a portion of our long-term debt are subject to fluctuation based upon changes in short-term interest rates. Interest expense could increase as a result of this factor. Our current debt service requirements on our bank credit facility primarily consist of interest payments on outstanding indebtedness. The bank credit facility consists of a $1.35 billion revolving credit facility that matures in June 2010, and a $500 million term loan. The term loan is being repaid in increments of $1.25 million per quarter that began on September 30, 2004 and will continue through March 31, 2011. The remaining balance of the term loan matures in June 2011. Debt service requirements under our senior subordinated notes existing at December 31, 2005 consist of semi-annual interest payments (based upon fixed annual interest rates ranging from 6.75% to 8.75%) and repayment of the $250 million, $300 million and $350 million of principal on April 15, 2012, December 15, 2012 and April 15, 2014, respectively. In January 2006, we issued $250 million principal amount of 7.125% senior subordinated notes due February 1, 2016 which also requires semi-annual interest payments and the repayment of the principal at maturity. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. It is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our bank credit facility, in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as it matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. We believe that we will need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness at each maturity. However, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We could have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint-venture partners. These financing strategies may not be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, certain states laws contain restrictions on the ability of 11 Table of Contents companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions. Some restrictions may prevent us from obtaining necessary capital. Employees At December 31, 2005, we employed approximately 23,400 persons. On such date, we had collective bargaining relationships with seven unions covering approximately 2,500 employees, substantially all of whom are employed at Stardust, Fremont, Eldorado, Main Street Station, Barbary Coast and Blue Chip. Several collective bargaining agreements are currently in effect and other agreements are in various stages of negotiation. Employees covered by expired agreements have continued to work during the negotiations, in one case under the terms of the expired agreements and, in another, under modifications thereof. ITEM 1B.
