ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are significant factors known to us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risks described below. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. General economic conditions and other external factors may adversely affect our industry and results of operations Companies within the snowmobile and ATV industry are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors such as general economic conditions, including high unemployment and economic recession. Specific factors affecting the industry include:  Overall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;  Interest rates and related higher dealer floorplan costs;  Sales incentives and promotional costs;  Adverse impact on margins due to increases in raw material and transportation costs which companies are unable to pass on to dealers without negatively affecting sales; and  Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Our products are subject to extensive federal and state safety, environmental and other government regulation that may require us to incur expenses or modify product offerings in order to maintain compliance with the actions of regulators. Our products are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to safety, environmental and other regulations promulgated by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments and individual states and provinces as well as international regulatory authorities. Although we believe that our snowmobiles and ATVs have always complied with applicable vehicle safety and emissions standards and related regulations, future regulations may require additional safety standards or emission reductions that would require additional expenses and/or modification of product offerings in order to maintain such compliance. Although we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or proposed regulations on our business and operating results, we believe that our business would be no more adversely affected than those of our competitors by the adoption of any pending laws or regulations. A significant adverse determination in any material product liability claim against us could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. Accidents involving personal injury and property damage occur in the use of snowmobiles and ATVs. Claims have been made against us from time to time. It is our policy to vigorously defend against these actions. We presently maintain product liability insurance on a per occurrence basis (with coverage being provided in respect of accidents which occurred during the policy year, regardless of when the related claim is made) in the amount of $10,000,000 in the aggregate, with a $10,000,000 self-insured retention. While we do not believe the outcome of any pending product liability litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations, material product liability claims against us may be made in the future. Adverse determination of material product liability claims made against us may adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. Significant repair and/or replacement with respect to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We provide a limited warranty for a period of six months for our ATVs and one year for our snowmobiles. We may provide longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market 11 Table of Contents conditions. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed which requires repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us through our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors and have not had a material effect on our business. See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changing weather conditions may reduce demand for certain of our products and negatively impact net sales. Lack of snowfall in any year in any particular region of the United States or Canada may adversely affect snowmobile retail sales and related parts, garments and accessories sales in that region. Weather conditions may materially affect our future sales of snowmobiles, ATVs, and parts, garments and accessories. We face intense competition in all product lines, from competitors that have greater financial and marketing resources. Failure to compete effectively against competitors would negatively impact our business and operating results. The snowmobile and ATV markets in the United States and Canada are highly competitive. Competition is based upon a number of factors, including performance, ride, suspension, innovation, technology, styling, fit and finish, brand loyalty, reliability, durability, price and distribution. At the dealer level, competition is based on a number of factors including sales and marketing support programs (such as sales incentives and cooperative advertising). Many of our competitors are more diversified and have financial and marketing resources which are substantially greater than ours. In addition, our products compete with other recreational products for the discretionary spending of consumers. If we are not able to effectively compete in this environment, our business and operating results will be negatively impacted. Termination or interruption of engine and other supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Suzuki has manufactured snowmobile engines (and through fiscal 2008 certain ATV engines) for us pursuant to supply agreements which have been automatically renewed annually. During late fiscal 2005, we began manufacturing certain of our own designed ATV engines as part of a strategic first step in a new engine program. We believe that having the capability to design and manufacture our own ATV engines enables us to offer customers more choices, provide excellent value, lower Japanese yen currency exposure and enhance our long-term competitive position. In 2007, we transitioned our engine manufacturing from the Thief River Falls, Minnesota facility to our new facility in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Beginning in fiscal 2009, substantially all our ATVs use engines that are produced from our engine facility or purchased separately or as part of the 50cc to 450cc units we receive from a Taiwanese supplier. On June 4, 2010, we signed an agreement under which we will discontinue the purchase of snowmobile engines from Suzuki after December 31, 2013(2014 model year). Suzuki will continue to provide replacement parts for engines through December 2020. While Suzuki has been a good long-term supplier of snowmobile engines, this new agreement will allow us to gain more control of our products, offer customers more choices, provide excellent value, lower Japanese yen currency exposure and enhance our ability to meet regulatory and performance requirements. We will expand our snowmobile engine design capabilities, work with a variety of vendors for various engine components, as well as better maximize our current engine manufacturing capacity. While we anticipate no significant difficulties in obtaining substitute supply arrangements for other raw materials or components for which we rely upon limited sources of supply, alternate supply arrangements may not be made on satisfactory terms. 12 Table of Contents Interruption of dealer floorplan financing could have a material impact on our business operations. We have agreements with GE Commercial Distribution Finance in the United States and TCF Commercial Finance Canada in Canada to provide snowmobile and ATV floorplan financing for our North American dealers. These agreements improve our liquidity by financing dealer purchases of products without requiring substantial use of our working capital. We are paid by the floorplan companies shortly after shipment and as part of our marketing programs we pay the floorplan financing of our dealers for certain set time periods depending on the size of a dealers order. While we expect to continue with our current multi-year dealer floorplan arrangements, these arrangements may not remain available or the costs and other terms of new financing arrangements may be significantly less favorable to us than has historically been available. Termination, interruption or nonrenewal of bank credit agreements could have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations. The seasonality of our snowmobile and ATV production cycles generates significant fluctuations in our working capital requirements during each year. Historically, we have financed our working capital requirements out of available cash balances at the beginning and end of the production cycle and with short-term bank borrowings during the middle of this cycle. While we expect to continue with our current multi-year working capital financing agreement from our lender, working capital financing arrangements may not remain available or the costs and other terms of new financing arrangements may be significantly less favorable to us than has historically been available. In addition, our current bank credit agreement contains covenants which we might be unable to meet in some future period requiring the need for waivers or replacement financing. ITEM 1B.
