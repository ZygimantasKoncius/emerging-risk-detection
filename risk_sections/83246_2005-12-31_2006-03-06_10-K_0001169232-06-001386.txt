Item 1A. Risk Factors - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The important factors, many of which are out of HUSI's control, which could affect actual results and could cause results to vary materially from those expressed in public statements or documents are: o changes in laws and regulations, including attempts by local, state and national regulatory agencies or offices or legislative bodies to control alleged "predatory" or discriminatory lending practices through broad or targeted initiatives aimed at lenders operating in consumer lending markets, including with respect to tax refund anticipation loans; o increased competition from well-capitalized companies or lenders with access to government sponsored organizations which may impact the terms, rates, costs or profits historically included in the loan products that HUSI offers or purchases; o changes in accounting or credit policies, practices or standards, as they may be internally modified from time to time or changes as may be required by regulatory agencies or the Financial Accounting Standards Board; o changes to operational practices from time to time such as determinations to acquire or sell private label credit card receivables, residential mortgage and other loans, to structure more collateralized funding as secured financings, or changes to HUSI's customer account management policies and practices and risk management/collection practices; o changes in overall economic conditions, including the interest rate environment in which HUSI operates, the capital markets in which HUSI funds its operations, the market values of consumer owned real estate throughout the United States, recession, employment and currency fluctuations; o consumer perception of the availability of credit, including price competition in the market segments which HUSI targets and the ramifications or ease of filing for personal bankruptcy; o the effectiveness of models or programs to predict loan delinquency or loss and initiatives to improve collections in all business areas, and changes HUSI may make from time to time in these models, programs and initiatives; o changes in management's estimates of probable losses inherent in HUSI's loan portfolios; o continued consumer acceptance of HUSI's distribution systems and demand for HUSI's loan or insurance products; o changes associated with, as well as the difficulty in, integrating systems, operational functions and cultures, as applicable, of any organization or portfolio acquired by HUSI; o a reduction of HUSI's debt ratings by any of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that rate these instruments to a level that is below HUSI's current ratings; o amendments to, and interpretations of risk-based capital guidelines and reporting instructions; o the impact of raising the required minimum payments on credit card accounts; o the costs, effects and outcomes of regulatory reviews or litigation relating to any nonprime loan receivables or the business practices or policies of any of HUSI's business units, including, but not limited to, additional compliance requirements; o increased funding costs resulting from instability in the capital markets and risk tolerance of fixed income investors; o the costs, effects and outcomes of any litigation matter that is determined adversely to HUSI or its subsidiaries; o the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to support the underwriting, servicing, collection and sales functions of HUSI's businesses; o failure to obtain expected funding from HSBC subsidiaries and clients; o the impact of natural and other catastrophic disasters or the ability to collect on receivables in affected areas; and o the inability of HUSI to manage any or all of the foregoing risks as well as anticipated. 13 Item 1B.
