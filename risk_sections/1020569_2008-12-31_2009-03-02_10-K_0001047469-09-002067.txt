Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our businesses face many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. Our investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. Operational Risks Governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. We may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. In addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. In reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states have adopted breach of data security statutes and regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached. In addition, one state has adopted, and other states are considering, regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt comprehensive written information security programs, and the Federal Trade Commission has proposed legislation intended to address data security through various methods that include requiring notification to affected persons of breaches of data security. Our information security practices have been the subject of review or inquiry by governmental agencies, and we may be subject to additional reviews or inquiries of governmental agencies in the future. Continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. In addition, the increased emphasis on information security is leading customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. We have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers in some incidents that the lost media or records contained personal information. As a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. In addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. We believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. If our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. Our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in interpretation. Our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. Our liability under these contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. We cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the 15 Table of Contents interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. While we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. We face competition for customers. We compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal information protection and storage services capabilities. These organizations may not begin or continue to use an outside company, such as our company, for their future information protection and storage services needs. We also compete, in both our physical and digital businesses, with multiple information protection and storage services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. We may not be able to effectively operate and expand our digital businesses. We operate certain digital information storage and protection businesses and are implementing a planned expansion into other digital businesses. Our participation in these markets poses certain unique risks. For example, we may be unable to: raise the amount of capital necessary to effectively participate in these markets; successfully acquire and integrate businesses or technologies to complement our current service offerings; keep up with rapid technological changes, evolving industry expectations and changing customer requirements; develop, hire or otherwise obtain the necessary technical expertise; accurately predict the size of the markets for any of these services; or compete effectively against other companies that possess greater technical expertise, capital or other necessary resources. In addition, the digital solutions we offer may not gain or retain market acceptance, or business partners upon whom we depend for technical and management expertise, and the hardware and software products we need to complement our services may not perform as expected. Our customers may shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. We derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. This storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. Alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM and optical disk. We can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. A significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. Our customers may be constrained in their ability to pay for services. The current recession may cause some customers to postpone projects for which they would otherwise retain our services, and may in some instances cause customers to forgo our services. Many of our largest customers are financial institutions, which have been particularly affected by the economic downturn; their condition may lead them to reduce their use of our services. In addition, a higher percentage of our customers may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, potentially affecting not only future business but also our ability to collect accounts receivable. 16 Table of Contents We may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our businesses. Because our physical businesses are heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. Such risks include: variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because of customers' acceptance of other storage technologies; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. International operations may pose unique risks. As of December 31, 2008, we provided services in 38 countries outside the U.S. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in information protection and storage services businesses in foreign markets. International operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the U.S. will not perform as expected; differences in business practices; and foreign currency fluctuations. In particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries to us and between our foreign subsidiaries. 17 Table of Contents We may be subject to claims that our technology, particularly with respect to digital services, violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. Third parties may have legal rights, including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use, especially in our digital business. Third parties may bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that these intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. Litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. Further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. Fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. Our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. Our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. We generate additional revenue when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates through a customer surcharge. As a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations while increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. Unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our results of operations. These events could result in customer disruption, physical damages to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock No History of Dividend Payments We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We may retain future earnings, if any, for the development of our business or use future earnings to repay outstanding indebtedness. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on or repurchasing our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determinations by us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future or repurchase our common stock will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations and business requirements. The terms of our credit agreement and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations. Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. We have a significant amount of indebtedness. The following table shows important credit statistics as of December 31, 2008: At December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Total long-term debt $ 3,243.2 Stockholders' equity $ 1,802.8 Debt to equity ratio 1.80 x 18 Table of Contents Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. Our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. These risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information protection and storage services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. Restrictive loan covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. Our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make capital expenditures and other investments. These restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness. However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. Since Iron Mountain is a holding company, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. Iron Mountain is a holding company, and substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. However, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries. 19 Table of Contents Acquisition and International Expansion Risks Failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. If we succeed in expanding our businesses, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. If not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to existing customers. In addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations. Consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. Our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. Failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our future results of operations. The success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. We can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business. Nor can we assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve the historical financial performance of Iron Mountain or our acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate these cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be unable to continue our international expansion. Our growth strategy involves expanding operations into international markets, and we expect to continue this expansion. Europe and Latin America have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion and we have begun our expansion into the Asia Pacific region. We have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in information protection and storage services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other information protection and storage services businesses in the future. This growth strategy involves risks. We may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future. For example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the U.S. We also compete with other information protection and storage services providers for companies to acquire. Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. If any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions, or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 20 Table of Contents Item 1B.
