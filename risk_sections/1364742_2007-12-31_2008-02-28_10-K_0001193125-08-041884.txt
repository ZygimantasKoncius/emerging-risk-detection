Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued) Failure to comply with ERISA regulations could result in penalties and cause the Companys earnings or stock price to decline. Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit specified transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The failure of any of BlackRocks subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the Companys earnings or cause its stock price to decline. BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities. Since PNCs ownership interest in BlackRock exceeds 25%, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of PNC, a financial holding company, which subjects BlackRock to general banking regulations that limit the activities and the types of businesses in which it may engage. Banking regulations may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations. As a non-bank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock is subject to the supervision, regulation and examination of the FRB. The Company is also subject to the broad enforcement authority of the FRB, including the FRBs power to prohibit BlackRock from engaging in any activity that, in the FRBs opinion, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the Companys business. The FRB also may impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking regulations. Legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results and financial condition for a particular period. Many aspects of BlackRocks business involve substantial risks of legal liability. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRocks activities. While Merrill Lynch has agreed to indemnify the Company for certain of the pre-closing liabilities related to legal proceedings acquired in the MLIM Transaction, entities that BlackRock now owns may be named as defendants in these matters and the Companys reputation may be negatively impacted. Liability for legal actions for which no indemnification is available could reduce earnings and cash flows and cause BlackRocks stock price to decline. Additionally, the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Company has no unresolved comments from the SEC staff relating to BlackRocks periodic or current reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934. 22
