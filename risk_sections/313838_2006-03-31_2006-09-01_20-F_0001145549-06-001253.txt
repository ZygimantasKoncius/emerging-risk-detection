Sony plans to invest 170.0 billion yen in semiconductor fabrication facilities and equipment during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. This investment includes investment in the production capacity for chips used for PS3, LCD televisions, LCD rear projection televisions, and mobile products. In addition to the facilities above, Sony has a number of other plants for electronic products throughout the world. Sony owns research and development facilities and employee housing and recreation facilities, as well as Sony Corporations headquarters buildings in Tokyo, Japan, where administrative functions and product development activities are carried out. SCEI leases its corporate headquarters buildings located in Tokyo, where administrative functions, product development, and software development are carried out. SCEA and SCEE lease their offices in the U.S. and Europe, respectively. Most of SMEJs offices, including leased premises, are located in Tokyo, Japan. SPEs corporate offices and motion picture and television production facilities are headquartered in Culver City, California, where it owns and operates a studio facility, Sony Pictures Studios. A second studio facility, The Culver Studios, which was owned and operated by SPE was sold by SPE in April 2004. SPE initially leased back a portion of this facility for a two-year period and subsequently extended the lease for an additional one-year period expiring April 20, 2007. SPE also leases office space and motion picture and television support facilities from affiliates of Sony Corporation and other third parties in various worldwide locations. SPEs film and videotape storage operations are located in various leased locations in the U.S. and Europe. In December 2001, SCA entered into a lease with a Variable Interest Entity, which is consolidated by Sony, for its corporate headquarters. Sony has the option to purchase the building at any time during the lease term which expires in December 2008. The aggregate floor space of this building is approximately 723,000 square feet. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects OPERATING RESULTS Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2006 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2005 Overview After translation of Sonys financial results into yen (the currency in which Sonys financial statements are prepared), in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), Sonys sales and operating revenue (sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased 4.4 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. On a local currency basis (regarding references to results of operations expressed on a local currency basis, refer to Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging below), sales for the fiscal year increased slightly. The 4.4 percent increase is mainly due to an increase in revenues within the Financial Services segment, as a result of an improvement in gains and losses on investments at Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Sony Life) due to the favorable Japanese domestic equity market conditions, and increased sales within the Game segment, as the result of the contribution from PSPtm (PlayStation® Portable) (PSP). In the Electronics segment, although sales benefited from the depreciation of the yen and there was an increase in sales of liquid crystal display (LCD) televisions, sales to outside customers decreased 0.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. There was a decline in sales of CRT televisions, due to a continued shift in demand towards flat panel televisions, and in plasma televisions, where new product development has been terminated. Operating income increased 67.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. On a local currency basis, operating income increased approximately 23 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income includes a one-time net gain of 73.5 billion yen, which resulted from the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Of this, a gain of 64.5 billion yen was recorded within the Electronics segment. In the Financial Services segment, operating income increased 29 Table of Contents due to an improvement in gains and losses on investments at Sony Life resulting from the above-mentioned favorable Japanese domestic equity market conditions. In the Electronics segment, although restructuring charges increased compared with the previous fiscal year, the amount of operating loss decreased as a result of a net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund mentioned above and favorable exchange rates. Operating income within the Game segment declined primarily as a result of an increase in research and development costs associated mainly with PLAYSTATION®3 (PS3). In the Pictures segment, operating income also declined due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues on feature films. Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 138.7 billion yen, an increase from the 90.0 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The primary restructuring activities were in the Electronics segment and All Other. Of the total 138.7 billion yen, Sony recorded 48.3 billion yen in personnel-related costs. This expense was incurred because 5,700 people, mainly in Japan, the U.S. and Western Europe, left Sony primarily through early retirement programs. For more detailed information about restructuring, please refer to Note 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Electronics Restructuring charges in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 were 125.8 billion yen, compared to 83.2 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Due to the worldwide market shrinkage and demand shift from CRT televisions to plasma and LCD panel televisions, Sony has been implementing a worldwide plan to rationalize CRT and CRT television production facilities and has been downsizing its business over several years. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, as part of this restructuring program, Sony recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 25.5 billion yen for CRT TV display manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. The impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The charge was recorded in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the consolidated statements of income. In addition to the above restructuring efforts, Sony undertook several headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs in the Electronics segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 45.1 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, and these charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. These staff reductions were achieved worldwide mostly through the implementation of early retirement programs. The remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2006 was 19.4 billion yen and will be paid through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. Sony will continue seeking the appropriate headcount level to optimize the workforce in the Electronics segment. All Other Restructuring charges within All Other for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 were 10.4 billion yen, compared to 5.3 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The main component of the restructuring charges recorded during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was an 8.5 billion yen asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex. 30 Table of Contents Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2005 2006 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,159.6 7,475.4 +4.4 % Operating income 113.9 191.3 +67.9 Income before income taxes 157.2 286.3 +82.1 Equity in net income of affiliated companies 29.0 13.2 -54.6 Net income 163.8 123.6 -24.5 Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 315.8 billion yen, or 4.4 percent, to 7,475.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Sales in this analysis of the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue, and excludes Financial service revenue. This is because Financial service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Furthermore, in the analysis of cost of sales, including research and development costs, to sales, only net sales are used. This is because cost of sales is an expense associated only with net sales. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 151.3 billion yen, or 3.0 percent, to 5,151.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and increased from 76.2 percent to 77.0 percent as a percentage of sales. Year on year, the cost of sales ratio increased from 81.8 percent to 81.9 percent in the Electronics segment, increased from 73.0 percent to 80.4 percent in the Game segment, and increased from 58.7 percent to 60.2 percent in the Pictures segment. In the Electronics segment, there was a deterioration in the cost of sales ratio for several products, in particular image sensors and CRT televisions. In the Game segment, there was an increase in the cost of sales ratio as a result of research and development costs associated with PS3. In the Pictures segment, the cost of sales ratio also increased primarily due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues on feature films. There was a decrease in personnel-related costs included in cost of sales of 9.8 billion yen, primarily within the Electronics segment, compared with the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 29.8 billion yen to 531.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 7.9 percent compared to 7.6 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 decreased by 8.0 billion yen, or 0.5 percent, to 1,527.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales improved from 23.2 percent in the previous fiscal year to 22.6 percent. Year on year, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales improved from 19.0 percent to 18.1 percent in the Electronics segment and from 21.0 percent to 18.7 percent in the Game segment. On the other hand, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased from 32.5 percent to 36.0 percent in the Pictures segment. 31 Table of Contents Personnel-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 60.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in severance-related expenses in the Electronics segment resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives. In addition, advertising and publicity expenses for the fiscal year increased by 59.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This was due to the fact that advertising and publicity expenses increased, primarily within the Pictures and Game segments. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 73.9 billion yen, compared with 28.0 billion in the previous fiscal year. This increase was as a result of losses recorded on the sale, disposal and impairment of CRT and CRT television production equipment in the Electronics segment, as well as an asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex. Operating Income Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 77.3 billion yen, or 67.9 percent, to 191.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating income margin increased from 1.6 percent to 2.6 percent. In descending order by amount of financial impact, the Financial Services segment, the Pictures segment, All Other and the Game segment contributed to operating income. On the other hand, although there was a net gain from the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund and the depreciation of the yen, the Electronics segment recorded an operating loss mainly due to a decrease in sales to outside customers, an increase in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets and a deterioration in the cost of sales ratio associated with a decline in unit selling prices. For a further breakdown of operating income for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses In the consolidated results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, other income increased by 56.0 billion yen, or 57.4 percent, to 153.6 billion yen, while other expenses increased by 4.2 billion yen, or 7.7 percent, to 58.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 95.1 billion yen, an increase of 51.8 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees increased by 44.5 billion yen, or 272.7 percent compared to the previous fiscal year to 60.8 billion yen. This was mainly the result of a gain of 21.5 billion yen on the change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees resulting from the initial public offering of Sony Communication Network Corporation (SCN), a gain of 20.6 billion yen on the change in interest resulting from the partial sale of Sonys investment in Monex Beans Holdings, Inc., and gains of 12.0 billion yen and 6.6 billion yen respectively on the change of interest at So-net M3 Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of SCN and at DeNA Co., Ltd., an equity affiliate of SCN accounted for by the equity method. Interest and dividends of 24.9 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 an increase of 10.2 billion yen, or 69.5 percent, compared with the previous year. This increase was mainly the result of an increase in interest received resulting from an improvement in the rate of return on overseas investments. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, interest payments totaling 29.0 billion yen were recorded, an increase of 4.4 billion yen, or 18.0 percent, compared with the previous year. In addition, a net foreign exchange loss of 3.1 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, compared to a net foreign exchange loss of 0.5 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The net foreign exchange loss was recorded because the value of the yen, especially during the first and third quarters of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, was lower than the value of the yen at the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts are entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency 32 Table of Contents denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. Income before Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased 129.1 billion yen, or 82.1 percent, to 286.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, as a result of the increase in operating income and the increase in the net amount of other income and other expenses mentioned above. Income Taxes Income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 160.5 billion yen to 176.5 billion yen. Compared to an effective tax rate of 10.2 percent in the previous fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 61.6 percent in the current fiscal year. This effective tax rate exceeded the Japanese statutory tax rate primarily due to the recording of additional valuation allowances against deferred tax assets by Sony Corporation and several of Sonys Japanese domestic and overseas consolidated subsidiaries, mainly within the Electronics segment, due to continued losses recorded at these businesses and the recording of an additional tax provision for the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rate was significantly lower than the Japanese statutory rate in the previous fiscal year as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances at Sonys U.S. subsidiaries associated with an improvement in operating performance. On June 30, 2006, Sony Corporation and SCEI each received notification from the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau (TRTB) of a reassessment of the profits they reported from transactions between SCEI and its subsidiary Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. (SCEA), for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000 through 2005. On the same date, Sony Corporation also received notification of a reassessment of the profits reported from transactions related to CD and DVD disc manufacturing operations with a number of its overseas subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2005. Sony Corporation and SCEI believe that their allocation of income for the periods in question was appropriate and that they have paid the proper amount of taxes in each of the jurisdictions. Therefore Sony Corporation and SCEI disagree with the position of the TRTB and have lodged an objection. In addition, Sony Corporation and SCEI plan to formally request bilateral consultations (where available) to obtain relief from double taxation under the applicable tax treaties of various countries. Transfer pricing was reassessed in accordance with the notification from the TRTB, resulting in additional Japanese income of 74.4 billion yen, which led to Sony Corporation and SCEI incurring an estimated additional cash tax (including corporate tax and others) of approximately 27.9 billion yen. Sony Corporation and SCEI believe that double taxation will be avoided through the procedure described above, and therefore Sony does not expect any material impact on its consolidated profit and loss as a result of this reassessment. Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method Equity in net income of affiliated companies during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was 13.2 billion yen, a decrease of 15.9 billion yen, or 54.6 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of affiliated companies for the previous fiscal year included the recording of 12.6 billion yen as equity in net income for InterTrust Technologies Corporation (InterTrust), which reflected InterTrusts proceeds from a license agreement arising from the settlement of a patent-related suit. In the current fiscal year, Sony Ericsson, as a result of increased sales of products including camera phone and Walkman® phone models, contributed 29.0 billion yen to equity in net income, an increase of 11.6 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Sony recorded equity income of 5.8 billion yen for SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT (SONY BMG) during the current fiscal year, compared to an equity loss of 3.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year as a result of a reduction in restructuring charges and the realization of incremental cost savings. However, Sony recorded an equity in net loss of 7.2 billion yen for S-LCD Corporation (S-LCD), a joint-venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the manufacture of amorphous TFT LCD panels and equity in 33 Table of Contents net loss of 16.9 billion yen for MGM Holdings, Inc. (MGM Holdings). The equity in net loss for MGM Holdings includes non-cash interest of 6.0 billion yen on cumulative preferred stock. Minority Interest in Income (Loss) of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries of 0.6 billion yen was recorded compared to minority interest in income of 1.7 billion yen previous year. This loss was primarily due to the recording of loss at ST Mobile Display Corporation, a joint venture with Toyota Industries Corporation for the manufacture of low-temperature polysilicon thin film transistor liquid crystal display panels for mobile products. Net Income Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 decreased by 40.2 billion yen, or 24.5 percent, to 123.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This decrease was primarily the result of the above-mentioned increase in income taxes and decrease in equity in net income of affiliated companies. As a percentage of sales, net income decreased from 2.3 percent to 1.7 percent. Return on stockholders equity decreased from 6.2 percent to 4.1 percent. (This ratio is calculated by dividing net income by the simple average of stockholders equity at the end of the previous fiscal year and at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006.) Basic net income per share was 122.58 yen compared with 175.90 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net income per share was 116.88 yen compared with 158.07 yen in the previous fiscal year. Refer to Notes 2 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The newly formed company, SONY BMG, is 50 percent owned by each parent company. Under U.S. GAAP, SONY BMG is accounted for by Sony using the equity method and, since August 1, 2004, 50 percent of net profits or losses of this business have been included under Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies. In connection with the establishment of this joint venture, Sonys non-Japan-based disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses, formerly included within the Music segment, a separate reporting segment until the end of the previous fiscal year, have been reclassified to the Electronics segment to recognize the new management reporting structure whereby Sonys Electronics segment has now assumed responsibility for these businesses. Effective April 1, 2005, a similar change was made with respect to Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing business. Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 in the Electronics segment have been restated to account for these reclassifications. Effective April 1, 2005, Sony no longer breaks out its music business as a reportable segment as it no longer meets the materiality threshold. Accordingly, the results for Sonys music business are now included within All Other, and the results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 have been reclassified to All Other for comparative purposes. Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 in All Other include the results of Sony Music Entertainment Inc.s (SMEI) music publishing business and Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. (SMEJ), excluding Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing business which, as noted above, has been reclassified to the Electronics segment. However, results for the previous fiscal year in All Other include the consolidated results for SMEIs recorded music business for the period through August 1, 2004, as well as the results for SMEIs music publishing business and SMEJ excluding Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing business. Electronics Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased 83.6 billion yen, or 1.7 percent, to 5,150.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 30.9 billion in the Electronics segment was recorded compared to the operating loss of 34.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Sales to outside customers on a yen basis decreased 0.9 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Regarding sales to outside customers by geographical area, although sales decreased in Japan by 12 percent, in the U.S. by 1 percent and in Europe by 4 percent, sales increased by 11 percent in non-Japan Asia and other geographic areas (Other Areas). In Japan, although there was a significant increase in the sales of LCD televisions, as well as increased sales for flash memory and hard drive digital audio players, sales decreased for such products as mobile phones, principally to Sony Ericsson, CRT televisions and plasma televisions. In the U.S., although there was an increase in sales of LCD and rear projection televisions, sales decreased for such products as CRT and 35 Table of Contents plasma televisions. In Europe, although sales increased for such products as LCD televisions, there was a decline in sales of such products as CRT and plasma televisions, and mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson. In Other Areas, sales of such products as LCD televisions and PCs increased, while sales of such products as CD-R/ RW drives and CRT televisions decreased. Performance by Product Category Sales and operating revenue by product category discussed below represent sales to outside customers, which do not include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Audio sales decreased by 35.7 billion yen, or 6.2 percent, to 536.2 billion yen. Sales of flash memory and hard drive digital audio players increased significantly, in conjunction with an increase in shipments to approximately 4.5 million units, compared to approximately 850,000 unit shipments recorded in the previous fiscal year. On the other hand, there was a significant decrease in the unit shipments of both CD and MD format headphone stereos due to a shift in market demand. In addition, car audio experienced a decrease in sales, and there was a slight decrease in home audio sales. Video sales decreased by 15.0 billion yen, or 1.4 percent, to 1,021.3 billion yen. In addition to a decrease in sales of digital cameras in Japan, the U.S. and Europe, there was a decrease in sales of VHS video recorders. Sales of digital cameras decreased, coupled with a decrease in worldwide shipments by approximately 0.5 million units to approximately 13.5 million units. Worldwide shipments of DVD recorders increased by approximately 300,000 units to approximately 2.0 million units, while sales increased slightly. Worldwide shipments of home-use video cameras increased by approximately 250,000 units to approximately 7.6 million units. DVD-Video player unit shipments decreased by approximately 1.5 million units to approximately 8.0 million units. Televisions sales increased by 6.6 billion yen, or 0.7 percent, to 927.8 billion yen. There was a significant increase in worldwide sales of LCD televisions, as worldwide shipments of LCD televisions increased by approximately 1.8 million units, to approximately 2.8 million units. Sales of projection televisions increased as the sales percentage of higher priced units increased, although worldwide shipments remained largely unchanged at approximately 1.2 million units. On the other hand, there was a significant decrease in worldwide sales of CRT televisions, primarily as a result of both a decrease in worldwide shipments of CRT televisions by approximately 2.7 million units to approximately 6.8 million units due to the continued shift in demand towards flat panel televisions, as well as a fall in unit prices. In addition, sales of plasma televisions, where new product development has been terminated, also decreased worldwide. Information and Communications sales increased by 26.4 billion yen, or 3.2 percent, to 842.5 billion yen. Although sales of desktop PCs decreased, overall sales increased as a result of favorable worldwide sales of notebook PCs. Worldwide unit shipments of PCs increased approximately 400,000 units to approximately 3.7 million units. Sales of broadcast- and professional-use products increased as a result of favorable sales of high-definition related products. Semiconductors sales decreased by 5.5 billion yen, or 2.3 percent, to 240.8 billion yen. The decrease was due to a decrease in sales of CCDs as the result of pricing pressures. Components sales increased by 37.3 billion yen, or 6.0 percent, to 656.8 billion yen. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of lithium-ion batteries, primarily for use in PCs and power tools, and Memory Sticks. On the other hand, sales of CD-R/ RW drives and optical pickups declined, primarily as a result of significant unit price declines. Sales of DVD+/-R/ RW drives increased, despite a deterioration in unit selling prices, as a result of a significant growth in units sold in association with the expansion of the market. Other sales decreased by 57.0 billion yen, or 9.6 percent, to 538.2 billion yen. This decrease was the result of a decrease in sales of mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson. 36 Table of Contents In the Electronics segment, cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 67.5 billion yen, or 1.6 percent to 4,184.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales ratio deteriorated by 0.1 percent to 81.9 percent compared to 81.8 percent in the previous fiscal year. Although there was an improvement in the cost of sales ratio for such products as video cameras and PCs, products that contributed to the deterioration in the cost of sales ratio included image sensors and CRT televisions, which experienced decreased sales. Restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales amounted to 23.8 billion yen, an increase of 14.2 billion yen compared with the 9.6 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs decreased 15.2 billion yen, or 3.5 percent, from 433.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 418.1 billion yen. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 27.2 billion yen, or 2.8 percent to 933.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The primary reason for this decrease was the recording of a 64.5 billion yen net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Of the restructuring charges recorded in the Electronics segment, the amount recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 4.1 billion yen from 53.6 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 49.5 billion yen. Of the restructuring charges recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, the amount recorded for headcount reductions, including reductions through the early retirement program, was 45.1 billion yen, a decrease of 5.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. On the other hand, royalty expenses decreased 17.2 billion yen. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased 0.9 percentage points from the 19.0 percent recorded in the previous fiscal year to 18.1 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net increased 40.0 billion yen to 63.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This amount includes 52.5 billion yen in restructuring charges, which includes 25.5 billion yen of restructuring charges related to CRT and CRT television manufacturing facilities in the U.S. The amount of restructuring charges included in loss on sale, disposal or impairment, net in the previous fiscal year was 19.2 billion yen. The amount of operating loss recorded in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 decreased as a result of the net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund, despite the recording of increased restructuring charges. Regarding profit performance by product, excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund, operating losses recorded by CRT televisions and LCD televisions increased, in addition to a decrease in operating income recorded by image sensors. On the other hand, the amount of operating loss recorded by DVD recorders (including PSXtm) decreased. In addition, there was an increase in operating income for video cameras and PCs. In August 2006, Dell Inc. (Dell) and Apple Computer Inc. (Apple) each announced voluntary recalls of lithium-ion battery packs used in certain notebook computers sold by these two companies. The recalled packs contain battery cells originally manufactured by Sony. Sony supports these recalls by our customers Dell and Apple. As of August 31, 2006, Sony anticipates no further recalls of battery packs using these particular battery cells. The recall arises because, on rare occasions, microscopic metal particles in the recalled battery cells may come into contact with other parts of the battery cell, leading to a short circuit within the cell. Typically, a battery pack will simply power off when a cell short circuit occurs. However, under certain rare conditions, an internal short circuit may lead to cell overheating and potentially flames. The potential for this to occur can be affected by variations in the system configurations found in different notebook computers. Sony has introduced a number of additional safeguards into its battery manufacturing process to address this condition and to provide a greater level of safety and security. 37 Table of Contents As of August 31, 2006, Sony estimates that the overall cost to Sony in supporting the recall programs of Apple and Dell will amount to between 20 billion yen and 30 billion yen. This overall cost is an estimate based on the costs of replacement battery packs and any other related costs to be incurred by Sony. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Slightly more than 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 took place in Japan, including the production of digital cameras, video cameras, flat panel televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and Memory Stick. Approximately 65 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for slightly more than 10 percent of total annual production, approximately 70 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for slightly more than 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining slightly less than 25 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Comparison of Results on a Local Currency Basis and Results on a Yen Basis In the Electronics segment, operating results benefited from the positive effect of the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and the Euro. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased, on a yen basis, by 1.7 percent, but decreased on a local currency basis by approximately 3 percent. In terms of operating performance, there was a decrease in the amount of operating loss compared to the previous fiscal year, but if calculated on a local currency basis, this operating loss was larger when compared to the actual results on a yen basis. Sales to outside customers by geographic area on a yen basis decreased in Japan by 12 percent, in the U.S. by 1 percent and in Europe by 4 percent. However, sales increased in Other Areas by 11 percent. Sales on a local currency basis for regions outside Japan decreased in the U.S. and Europe by 7 percent, but increased by 2 percent in Other Areas. Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 228.9 billion yen, or 31.4 percent, to 958.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 34.4 billion yen, or 79.7 percent, to 8.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and the operating income margin decreased from 5.9 percent to 0.9 percent. Sales in the Game segment on a local currency basis increased approximately 27 percent. In addition, on a local currency basis, operating income decreased approximately 62 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. By region, although sales decreased slightly in Japan, there was a significant increase in sales in the U.S. and Europe. There was a significant increase in hardware sales compared to the previous fiscal year. Sales increased significantly, mainly in the U.S and Europe, and sales in Japan remained relatively unchanged compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to a significant contribution to sales from PSP, which experienced favorable growth in all geographic areas and the fact that PlayStation®2 (PS2) sales were on a par with those in the previous fiscal year. In addition, although PS2 software sales decreased, as a result of the contribution to sales from PSP software, software sales in Japan, the U.S. and Europe were relatively unchanged compared to the previous fiscal year. 38 Table of Contents Total worldwide production shipments of hardware and software were as follows: Worldwide hardware production shipments:*  PS2: 16.22 million units (an increase of 0.05 million units)  PSP: 14.06 million units (an increase of 11.09 million units) Worldwide software production shipments:*/**  PS2: 223 million units (a decrease of 29 million units)  PSP: 41.6 million units (an increase of 35.9 million units) * Production shipments of hardware and software are counted upon shipment of the products from manufacturing bases. Sales of such products are recognized when the products are delivered to customers. ** Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. Operating income decreased significantly compared with the previous fiscal year. Although profits from the PS2 and PSP businesses exceeded those in the previous fiscal year, the decrease in operating income was mainly the result of continued high research and development costs associated with PS3, as well as the recording of charges associated with preparation for the launch of the PS3 platform including a write-down of approximately 25.0 billion yen for semiconductor components for use in PS3. The cost of sales to sales ratio deteriorated by 7.4 percent, from 73.0 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 80.4 percent for the reasons mentioned above for operating income. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased by 2.3 percent, compared to 21.0 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 18.7 percent as a result of the sales increase. Charges related to the launch of the PS3 platform are anticipated to result in a significant loss within the Game segment for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007, reflecting primarily an expected negative margin as a result of strategic pricing on PS3 hardware sales. Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 12.2 billion yen, or 1.7 percent, to 745.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 36.5 billion yen, or 57.1 percent, to 27.4 billion yen and the operating income margin decreased from 8.7 percent to 3.7 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE), a U.S.-based subsidiary. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment decreased approximately 4 percent and operating income decreased by approximately 61 percent. Sales decreased primarily due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues on feature films, partially offset by an increase in television product revenues. The lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues primarily resulted from the strong performance of Spider-Man 2 in the prior fiscal year coupled with the disappointing performance of certain films in the current fiscal year film slate, particularly Stealth, Zathura and the Legend of Zorro. Sales for the fiscal year release slate decreased 967 million U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. Television product revenues increased by approximately 220 million U.S. dollars primarily due to higher advertising and subscription sales from several of SPEs international channels, higher sales of television library product and the extension of a licensing agreement for Wheel of Fortune. Operating income for the segment decreased significantly, primarily due to the disappointing overall performance of the current fiscal years film slate in both the theatrical and home entertainment markets. Operating loss from the current fiscal year release slate increased 623 million U.S. dollars as compared to the prior fiscal years release slate due to the same factors contributing to the decrease in film revenue noted above. Partially offsetting this was an increase in operating income of 83 million U.S. dollars for television product due to the same factors noted above for revenue. 39 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2006, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television product. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year that the product is available for broadcast. Financial Services Please note that the revenue and operating income at Sony Life, Sony Assurance Inc. (Sony Assurance) and Sony Bank Inc. (Sony Bank) discussed below on a U.S. GAAP basis differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 182.7 billion yen, or 32.6 percent, to 743.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 132.8 billion yen, or 239.4 percent, to 188.3 billion yen and the operating income margin increased to 25.3 percent compared with the 9.9 percent of the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue increased by 170.8 billion yen, or 36.0 percent, to 645.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The main reasons for this increase were an improvement in gains and losses from investments at Sony Life, primarily within the general account, as well as an increase in revenue from insurance premiums reflecting an increase of insurance-in-force. The improvement in gains and losses from investments in the general account was principally a result of an improvement in valuation gains from stock conversion rights in convertible bonds resulting from the aforementioned favorable Japanese domestic stock market conditions. Operating income at Sony Life increased by 127.4 billion yen or 208.8 percent to 188.4 billion yen, mainly as a result of a significant improvement in gains and losses on investments in the general account mentioned above. At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by an expansion in automobile insurance-in-force. Operating income increased due to an increase in insurance revenue and an improvement in the expense ratio (the ratio of sales, general and administrative expenses to premiums). At Sony Bank, which started operations in June 2001, although foreign exchange losses were recorded as a result of the depreciation of the yen on part of Sony Banks foreign currency deposits, revenue rose as there was an increase in interest revenue associated with an increase in the balance of assets from investing activities, in addition to revenues from other investing activities. The amount of the operating loss decreased compared with the previous fiscal year, as a result of the increase in revenue. At Sony Finance International, Inc. (Sony Finance), a leasing and credit financing business subsidiary in Japan, revenue increased due to an increase in leasing and credit card revenue. In terms of profitability, a reduced operating loss was recorded compared to the previous fiscal year, as a result of improved profitability at a credit card business at Sony Finance. Condensed Statements of Income Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of income for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services as well as condensed consolidated statements of income. This presentation is not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. 40 Table of Contents Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Condensed Statements of Income Fiscal Year ended March 31 2005 2006 (Yen in millions) Financial Services Financial service revenue 560,557 743,215 Financial service expenses 505,067 554,892 Operating income 55,490 188,323 Other income (expenses), net 10,204 24,522 Income before income taxes 65,694 212,845 Income taxes and other 25,698 80,586 Income before cumulative effect of an accounting change 39,996 132,259 Cumulative effect of an accounting change (4,713 )  Net income 35,283 132,259 Fiscal Year ended March 31 2005 2006 (Yen in millions) Sony without Financial Services Net sales and operating revenue 6,632,728 6,763,907 Costs and expenses 6,575,354 6,762,375 Operating income 57,374 1,532 Other income (expenses), net 40,639 71,952 Income before income taxes 98,013 73,484 Income taxes and other (37,043 ) 82,127 Income (loss) before cumulative effect of an accounting change 135,056 (8,643 ) Cumulative effect of an accounting change   Net income (loss) 135,056 (8,643 ) 41 Table of Contents Fiscal Year ended March 31 2005 2006 (Yen in millions) Consolidated Financial service revenue 537,715 720,566 Net sales and operating revenue 6,621,901 6,754,870 7,159,616 7,475,436 Costs and expenses 7,045,697 7,284,181 Operating income 113,919 191,255 Other income (expenses), net 43,288 95,074 Income before income taxes 157,207 286,329 Income taxes and other (11,344 ) 162,713 Income before cumulative effect of an accounting change 168,551 123,616 Cumulative effect of an accounting change (4,713 )  Net income 163,838 123,616 All Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, sales within All Other were comprised mainly of sales from SMEJ, a Japanese domestic recorded music business; SMEIs music publishing business; SCN, an Internet-related service business subsidiary operating mainly in Japan; a retailer of imported general merchandise in Japan; an in-house facilities management business in Japan; and an advertising agency business in Japan. Results for the first four months of the previous fiscal year in All Other incorporated the results for SMEIs recorded music business, which, as noted above, was combined with Bertelsmann AGs recorded music business to form the SONY BMG joint venture which is accounted for by the equity method. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 decreased by 51.0 billion yen, or 11.1 percent, to 408.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of total segment sales, 80 percent were sales to outside customers. In terms of profit performance, operating income for All Other increased for the fiscal year from 4.2 billion yen to 16.2 billion yen. During the fiscal year, the sales decrease within All Other reflects the fact that, as noted above, the results for the first four months of the previous fiscal year in All Other incorporated the results for SMEIs recorded music business. Sales at SMEJ were relatively unchanged compared with the previous fiscal year. Best selling albums during the fiscal year included Ken Hirai 10th Anniversary Complete Single Collection 95-05 Uta Baka by Ken Hirai, NATURAL by ORANGE RANGE and BEST by Mika Nakashima. Excluding sales recorded within Sonys music business, there was an increase in sales within All Other. This increase was mainly due to strong sales at a business engaged in the production and marketing of animation products, favorable sales both at SCN and its subsidiaries, as well as an increase in sales recorded at an imported general merchandise retail business. Regarding profit performance within All Other, operating income of 16.2 billion yen was recorded, an 12.0 billion yen increase compared to the 4.2 billion yen of operating income recorded in the previous fiscal year. This increase was mainly the result of the fact that the results for SMEIs recorded music business, which recorded an operating loss in the previous fiscal year, are now recorded as part of the results of the SONY BMG joint venture, and the continued strong performance at SMEJ, where operating income increased approximately 40 percent compared to the previous fiscal year mainly due to an improvement in the cost of sales ratio and the recording of a net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. 42 Table of Contents Excluding the operating income recorded in the music business, a loss was recorded within All Other mainly as the result of an asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex. This was offset to some extent by cost reductions at network related businesses within Sony Corporation. In June 2006, Sony Corporation transferred 51 percent stock of StylingLife Holdings Inc., a holding company covering six retail companies within Sony previously included within All Other, to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nikko Principal Investments Japan Ltd. As a result of this transaction, Sony recognized a 18.0 billion yen gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees during the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the average value of the yen was 112.3 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 136.3 yen against the Euro, which was 5.1 percent lower against the U.S. dollar and 2.0 percent lower against the Euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. Operating results on a local currency basis described in Overview and Operating Performance show results of sales and operating revenue and operating income obtained by applying the yens monthly average exchange rate in the previous fiscal year to monthly local currency-denominated sales, cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, as if the value of the yen had remained constant. In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S.-based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a local currency basis and results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. In addition, Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that local currency basis results provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations mainly derived from the fact that the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. Sony Global Treasury Services Plc (SGTS) in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycle for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment utilized for portfolio investments and Asset Liability Management (ALM). 43 Table of Contents To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in Other Income and Expenses. The notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts, currency option contracts purchased and currency option contracts written as of March 31, 2006 were 1,489.2 billion yen, 457.4 billion yen and 163.7 billion yen, respectively. Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2005 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2004 Overview After translation of Sonys financial results into yen (the currency in which Sonys financial statements are prepared), in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), Sonys sales and operating revenue (sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased 4.5 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. On a local currency basis (regarding references to results of operations expressed on a local currency basis, refer to Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging below), sales for the fiscal year decreased approximately 3 percent. This decrease is mainly due to the fact that, as of August 1, 2004, the sales of Sonys overseas recorded music business are no longer recorded within Sonys consolidated sales as a result of the establishment of SONY BMG, which is accounted for by the equity method, through the merger of Sonys overseas recorded music business with Bertelsmann AGs recorded music business, and a change in the method of recognizing insurance premiums received on certain products at Sony Life, as of the third quarter beginning October 1, 2003, from being recorded as revenues to being offset against the related provision for future insurance policy benefits. Operating income increased 15.2 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. On a local currency basis, operating income increased approximately 26 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. In addition to a decrease in restructuring charges compared to the previous fiscal year, increased operating income was recorded in the Pictures segment, where Spider-Man 2 was a significant contributor, and operating income was recorded in All Other, where several best-selling albums and singles at SMEJ contributed to improved profitability. On the other hand, the Electronics segment, where the cost of sales ratio deteriorated due to pricing pressures, and the Game segment, where there was a decrease in hardware sales, both experienced deteriorated profitability. Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 90.0 billion yen, a decrease from the 168.1 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The primary restructuring activities were in the Electronics segment and All Other. Of the total 90.0 billion yen, Sony recorded 53.6 billion yen in personnel-related costs. This expense was incurred because 12,000 people, mainly in Japan, the U.S. and Western Europe, left the company primarily through early retirement programs. For more detailed information about restructuring, please refer to Note 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Electronics Restructuring charges in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were 83.2 billion yen, compared to 145.7 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Of these restructuring charges, for 44 Table of Contents the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 restructuring charges of 2.1 billion yen were recorded in Sonys non-Japan disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses, formerly included within the Music segment, a separate reporting segment until the end of the previous fiscal year, have been reclassified to the Electronics segment to recognize the new management reporting structure whereby Sonys Electronics segment has now assumed responsibility for these businesses. See Note 24 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this reclassification. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Sony made a decision to shut down certain CRT TV display manufacturing operations in Japan to rationalize production facilities and downsize its business, due to a contraction in the market as a result of a shift in demand from CRT televisions to plasma and LCD panel televisions. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, as part of this restructuring program, Sony recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 7.5 billion yen for the CRT TV display manufacturing facilities located in Europe. The impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The charge was recorded in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the consolidated statements of income. In addition to the above restructuring efforts, Sony undertook several headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs in the Electronics segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 51.0 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, and these charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. These staff reductions were achieved worldwide mostly through the implementation of early retirement programs. The remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2005 was 14.0 billion yen and will be paid through the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. All Other Restructuring charges in All Other, including at SMEJ, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were 5.3 billion yen, compared to 13.7 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. With regard to Sonys music business included within All Other, due to the continued contraction of the worldwide music market caused by slow worldwide economic growth, the saturation of the CD market, the effects of piracy and other illegal duplication, parallel imports, pricing pressures and the diversification of customer preferences, Sony has been actively repositioning its music business for the future by looking to create a more effective and profitable business model. As a result, Sonys music business has undertaken a worldwide restructuring program since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 to reduce staffing and other costs through the consolidation and rationalization of facilities worldwide. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, in continuation of the worldwide restructuring program and in connection with the merger of its recorded music business into a joint venture with Bertelsmann AG, Sony recorded restructuring charges totaling 3.0 billion yen within its music business. These restructuring charges exclude restructuring charges that were recorded in the disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses that were formerly included within the Music segment, a separate reporting segment until the end of the previous fiscal year, but have now been reclassified to the Electronics segment. Restructuring activities included the shutdown of certain distribution operations after the establishment of the recorded music joint venture with Bertelsmann AG as well as the further rationalization of overhead functions through staff reductions. The restructuring charges consisted of personnel-related costs of 0.9 billion yen and other related costs of 2.1 billion yen. These charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Positions were eliminated across various employee levels, business functions, operating units, and geographic regions during this phase of the worldwide restructuring program. Excluding restructuring within Sonys consolidated music business, 2.0 billion yen of restructuring charges were recorded within All Other during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, mainly as a result of non-cash impairment charges recorded at resulting network-related businesses within Sony Corporation as a result of business reorganizations. The restructuring charges consisted of personnel-related costs of 0.7 billion yen and other related costs of 1.3 billion yen. 45 Table of Contents Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,496.4 7,159.6 -4.5 % Operating income 98.9 113.9 +15.2 Income before income taxes 144.1 157.2 +9.1 Equity in net income of affiliated companies 1.7 29.0 +1,594.2 Net income 88.5 163.8 +85.1 Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 336.8 billion yen, or 4.5 percent, to 7,159.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Sales in this analysis of the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue, and excludes Financial service revenue. This is because Financial Service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Furthermore, in the analysis of cost of sales, including research and development costs, to sales, only net sales are used. This is because cost of sales is an expense associated only with net sales. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 58.1 billion yen, or 1.1 percent, to 5,000.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, but increased from 73.5 percent to 76.2 percent as a percentage of sales. Year on year, the cost of sales ratio rose from 78.9 percent to 81.8 percent in the Electronics segment, increased from 70.1 percent to 73.0 percent in the Game segment and decreased from 74.0 percent to 73.7 percent in All Other. On the other hand, the cost of sales ratio improved in the Pictures segment from 60.0 percent to 58.7 percent. In the Electronics segment, there was a deterioration in the cost of sales ratio particularly within the CRT television, portable audio, DVD recorder (including PSX) and video camera businesses. In the Game segment, there was an increase in the cost of sales ratio as a result of costs associated with both the launch of PSP and the changeover to the new PS2 model. In the Pictures segment, the cost of sales ratio also improved primarily due to the substantial contribution from Spider-Man 2. In All Other, there was an improvement in the cost of sales ratio in the music business due to the establishment of SONY BMG which is accounted for under the equity method resulting in a higher percentage of sales being derived from SMEJ which benefited from the contribution of greatest hits album sales. Personnel-related costs included in cost of sales decreased by 52.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, primarily within the Electronics segment. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 12.5 billion yen to 502.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 7.6 percent compared to 7.5 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 263.2 billion yen, or 14.6 percent, to 1,535.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales improved from 25.9 percent in the previous fiscal year to 23.2 percent. Year on year, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales improved from 21.2 percent to 19.0 percent in the Electronics segment, from 21.1 percent to 21.0 percent in the Game 46 Table of Contents segment, and improved from 39.5 percent to 37.3 percent in All Other, and from 35.0 percent to 32.5 percent in the Pictures segment. Personnel-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 169.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in severance related expenses in the Electronics segment resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives, and the fact that personnel-related costs in Sonys recorded music business outside Japan are no longer recorded within Sonys consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses due to the establishment of SONY BMG mentioned above. In addition, advertising and publicity expenses for the fiscal year decreased by 51.6 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to the fact that advertising and publicity expenses that were recorded in All Other decreased due to the establishment of SONY BMG and a reduction in advertising and publicity expenses in the Pictures segment. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 28.0 billion yen, compared with 35.5 billion in the previous fiscal year. Although losses were recorded on the sale, disposal and impairment of CRT and CRT television production equipment in the Electronics segment, gains were recorded mainly from the sale of land and buildings in both the Electronics segment and All Other. Operating Income Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased by 15.0 billion yen, or 15.2 percent, to 113.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating income margin increased from 1.3 percent to 1.6 percent. The business segments that contributed the most to operating income, in descending order by amount of financial impact, were the Pictures, Financial Services and Game segments. On the other hand, the Electronics segment recorded an operating loss mainly due to the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar as well as an increase in cost of sales that exceeded the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. For a further breakdown of operating income for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses In the consolidated results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, other income decreased by 24.7 billion yen, or 20.2 percent, to 97.6 billion yen, while other expenses decreased by 22.8 billion yen, or 29.5 percent, to 54.3 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 43.3 billion yen, a decrease of 1.9 billion yen, or 4.2 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. A net foreign exchange loss of 0.5 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, compared to a net foreign exchange gain of 18.1 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The net foreign exchange loss was recorded because the value of the yen, especially during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, was lower than the value of the yen at the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts are entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, a loss on devaluation of securities investments of 3.7 billion yen was recorded, an improvement of 12.8 billion yen, or 77.5 percent, compared with the previous year. This improvement was primarily due to the recording of valuation losses of 10.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year related to securities issued by a privately held Japanese company engaged in cable broadcasting and other businesses which Sony accounted for under the cost method. The gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees increased by 11.5 billion yen, or 235.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year to 16.3 billion yen. This was mainly the result of gains of 9.0 billion yen from a change in interest from Monex Inc., an equity affiliate of Sony, following its business integration by way of share transfer with Nikko Beans, Inc and total gains of 4.7 billion yen from the sale of 47 Table of Contents stock and a change in interest in a subsidiary resulting from the initial public offering of So-net M3 Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of SCN. In addition, the net gain recorded on sales of securities investments decreased 6.3 billion yen, or 53.8 percent, to 5.4 billion yen. This was primarily a result of the recording of a deferred gain of 6.0 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, from Sonys sale, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, of its equity interest in Telemundo Communications Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, a U.S.-based Spanish language television network and station group that was accounted for under the equity method. Income before Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased 13.1 billion yen, or 9.1 percent, to 157.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, as a result of the increase in operating income and the decrease in net amount of other income and other expenses mentioned above. Income Taxes Income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 36.7 billion yen, or 69.6 percent, to 16.0 billion yen. Compared to an effective tax rate of 36.6 percent in the previous fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 10.2 percent in the current fiscal year. As a result of the recording of operating losses in the past, the U.S. subsidiaries of Sony have had valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for U.S. federal taxes and certain state taxes. However, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, based on both improved operating results in recent years and a sound outlook for the future operating performance at Sonys U.S. subsidiaries, Sony reversed 67.9 billion yen of such valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction to income tax expense. On the other hand, certain of Sonys subsidiaries recorded new valuation allowances against deferred tax assets during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method Equity in net income of affiliated companies during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was 29.0 billion yen, an increase of 27.3 billion yen, or 1,594.2 percent, compared to 1.7 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of Sony Ericsson, a joint venture focused on mobile phone handsets, was 17.4 billion yen, an increase of 11.0 billion yen, or 171.9 percent, compared to the 6.4 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of affiliated companies for the current fiscal year includes the recording of 12.6 billion yen as equity in net income from InterTrust. This amount reflects InterTrusts proceeds from a license agreement with Microsoft Corporation arising from the settlement of a patent-related lawsuit. In addition, due to significant restructuring costs, an equity loss of 3.4 billion yen was recorded at SONY BMG. Furthermore, equity in net loss was recorded at affiliates such as Star Channel Inc., a Japan-based subscription television company specializing in the broadcast of movies, and S-LCD, a joint-venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the manufacture of amorphous TFT LCD panels. Minority Interest in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased by 0.7 billion yen, or 30.6 percent, to 1.7 billion yen. This decrease was primarily due to the recording of minority interest at certain television and home entertainment subsidiaries in the Pictures segment in the previous fiscal year. Net Income Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased by 75.3 billion yen, or 85.1 percent, to 163.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This increase was the result primarily of the abovementioned increase in income before income taxes, a decrease in the effective tax rate, as well as an increase in equity in net income of affiliated companies. As a percentage of sales, net income increased from 1.2 percent to 2.3 percent. Return on stockholders equity increased from 3.8 percent to 6.2 percent. (This 48 Table of Contents ratio is calculated by dividing net income by the simple average of stockholders equity at the end of the previous fiscal year and at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.) Basic net income per share was 175.90 yen compared with 95.97 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net income per share was 158.07 yen compared with 87.00 yen in the previous fiscal year. Refer to Notes 2 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Segment Information Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue Electronics 5,087.5 5,066.8 -0.4 % Game 780.2 729.8 -6.5 Pictures 756.4 733.7 -3.0 Financial Services 593.5 560.6 -5.6 All Other 662.8 459.9 -30.6 Elimination (384.0 ) (391.1 )  Consolidated 7,496.4 7,159.6 -4.5 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 Percent change (Yen in billions) Operating income (loss) Electronics (8.1 ) (34.3 )  Game 67.6 43.2 -36.1 % Pictures 35.2 63.9 +81.4 Financial Services 55.2 55.5 +0.6 All Other (16.2 ) 4.2  Total 133.7 132.5 -0.9 Elimination and unallocated corporate expenses (34.8 ) (18.6 )  Consolidated 98.9 113.9 +15.2 As of August 1, 2004, Sony and Bertelsmann AG combined their recorded music businesses in a joint venture. The newly formed company, SONY BMG, is 50 percent owned by each parent company. Under U.S. GAAP, SONY BMG is accounted for by Sony using the equity method and, since August 1, 2004, 50 percent of net profits or losses of this business have been included under Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies. In connection with the establishment of this joint venture, Sonys non-Japan-based disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses, formerly included within All Other, have been reclassified to the Electronics segment to recognize the new management reporting structure whereby Sonys Electronics segment has now assumed responsibility for these businesses. Effective April 1, 2005, a similar change was made with respect to Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing business. Results for the fiscal years ended 49 Table of Contents March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005 in the Electronics segment have been restated to account for these reclassifications. Effective April 1, 2005, Sony no longer breaks out its music business as a reportable segment as it no longer meets the materiality threshold. Accordingly, the results for Sonys music business are now included within All Other and the results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005 have been reclassified to All Other for comparative purposes. Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 in All Other include the consolidated results for SMEIs recorded music business for the period through August 1, 2004, as well as the results for SMEIs music publishing business and SMEJ excluding Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing business. However, results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 include the consolidated results for SMEIs recorded music business for the full twelve month period, as well as the results for SMEIs music publishing business and SMEJ excluding Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing business. In July 2004, Sony completed the integration of its semiconductor manufacturing business in order to establish a more efficient and coordinated semiconductor supply structure by transferring Sony Computer Entertainments semiconductor manufacturing operation from the Game segment to the Electronics segment. As a result of this transfer, sales revenue and expenditures associated with this operation are now recorded within the Semiconductor category in the Electronics segment. The results for the same period of the prior fiscal years have not been restated as such comparable figures cannot be practically obtained given that the semiconductor manufacturing operation was not operated as a separate line of business within the Game segment. This integration of the semiconductor manufacturing businesses is a part of Sonys semiconductor strategy of utilizing semiconductor technologies and manufacturing equipment originally developed or designed for the Game business within Sony as a whole. Electronics Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased 20.6 billion yen, or 0.4 percent, to 5,066.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 34.3 billion in the Electronics segment was recorded compared to the operating loss of 8.1 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Sales to outside customers on a yen basis decreased 1.1 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Regarding sales to outside customers by geographical area, although sales decreased in Japan by 10 percent and in the U.S. by 4 percent, they remained almost unchanged in Europe and increased by 9 percent in non-Japan Asia and other geographic areas (Other Areas). In Japan, although there was a significant increase in the sales of LCD televisions, and an increase in the sales of DVD recorders (including PSX), there was a decrease in the sales of PCs, mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson, broadcast- and professional-use equipment and CRT televisions. In the U.S., there was an increase in sales of LCD rear projection televisions and digital cameras, although sales mainly of CRT televisions, PCs, computer displays and portable audio declined. In Europe, sales increased, primarily of digital cameras, LCD televisions and plasma televisions. However, there was a decrease in the sales mainly of CRT televisions and portable audio. In Other Areas, sales mainly of digital cameras, CD-R/RW and DVD+/ -R/RW drives and PCs increased while sales of primarily portable audio, optical pickups and home audio decreased. Performance by Product Category Sales and operating revenue by product category discussed below represent sales to outside customers, which do not include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Audio sales decreased by 103.6 billion yen, or 15.3 percent, to 571.9 billion yen. Sales of headphone stereos declined as a result of a significant decrease in the unit shipments of both CD format and MD format devices due to a shift in demand towards hard disc- and flash-based memory players. Worldwide shipments of CD format devices decreased by approximately 3.68 million units to approximately 7.28 million units and worldwide shipments of MD format devices decreased by approximately 1.44 million units to 1.92 million 50 Table of Contents units. Sales of home audio declined primarily due to a contraction of the market. On the other hand, overall sales of car audio increased slightly due to strong sales in the European market and Other Areas. Video sales increased by 87.0 billion yen, or 9.2 percent, to 1,036.3 billion yen. There was a growth in the sales of digital cameras outside of Japan and DVD recorders (including PSX) recorded a significant increase in sales worldwide. Worldwide shipments of digital cameras increased by approximately 4.0 million units to approximately 14.0 million units. Worldwide shipments of DVD recorders were approximately 650,000 units in the previous fiscal year but increased to approximately 1.7 million units in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Worldwide shipments of home-use video cameras increased by approximately 750,000 units to approximately 7.35 million units, but overall sales remained almost unchanged, due to increased price competition. DVD-Video player sales decreased due to pricing pressure, although unit shipments increased by approximately 1.0 million units to approximately 9.5 million units. Televisions sales increased by 36.6 billion yen, or 4.1 percent, to 921.2 billion yen. In addition to a significant increase in worldwide sales of LCD televisions, there was a significant increase in the sales of plasma televisions outside of Japan, particularly in Europe, and of projection televisions in the U.S. Worldwide shipments of LCD televisions increased by approximately 570,000 units, compared to the previous fiscal year, to approximately 1.0 million units; plasma television shipments increased by approximately 90,000 units to approximately 300,000 units; and projection televisions shipments increased by approximately 280,000 units to approximately 1.2 million units. On the other hand, although there was an increase in worldwide shipments of CRT televisions by approximately 100,000 units to approximately 9.5 million units, sales decreased significantly as a result of a fall in unit prices due to the continued shift in demand towards flat panel televisions. In addition, sales of computer displays also decreased worldwide. Information and Communications sales decreased by 62.7 billion yen, or 7.1 percent, to 816.2 billion yen. Despite an increase in notebook PC sales due to strong sales outside Japan, overall sales decreased due to a decrease in sales of desktop PCs. Worldwide unit shipments of PCs increased approximately 100,000 units to approximately 3.3 million units. Sales of personal digital assistants decreased significantly due to a downsizing of the business. Sales of broadcast- and professional-use products decreased slightly compared to the previous fiscal year, despite recording increased sales outside Japan, as sales in Japan decreased as a result of the recording of higher sales, in the previous fiscal year, from the sale of equipment to two television stations which opened new broadcasting facilities. Semiconductors sales decreased by 6.9 billion yen, or 2.7 percent, to 246.3 billion yen. The decrease was due to a decrease in sales of CCDs as the result of pricing pressures. Regarding LCDs, sales of low temperature polysilicon LCDs for mobile phones increased significantly. Components sales decreased by 4.3 billion yen, or 0.7 percent, to 619.5 billion yen. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales of CD-R/RW drives and optical pickups associated mainly with significant declines in unit prices. Sales of DVD+/-R/RW drives increased due to a production and sales alliance with a third party. Regarding lithium-ion batteries, sales for use in digital cameras and mobile phones increased. Other sales increased by 1.8 billion yen, or 0.3 percent, to 595.2 billion yen. The increase resulted from increased sales at Sonys non-Japan-based disc manufacturing business. However, there was a slight decrease in sales of mobile phone handsets mainly to Sony Ericsson. In the Electronics segment, cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased by 131.5 billion yen, or 3.3 percent to 4,117.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales to sales ratio deteriorated by 2.9 percent to 81.8 percent compared to 78.9 percent in the previous fiscal year. Products that contributed to the deterioration in the cost of sales to sales ratio were CRT televisions and portable audio products, which both experienced a decrease in sales, and DVD recorders (including PSX) and video cameras, which were both impacted by falling unit prices. Restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales amounted to 9.6 billion yen, a decrease of 0.5 billion yen compared with the 10.1 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs increased 2.4 billion yen, or 0.6 percent, from 431.0 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 433.3 billion yen. Although there was an increase in research and development costs within the segment as a result of the transfer of semiconductor manufacturing operations 51 Table of Contents from the Game segment to the Electronics segment in association with the business integration of Sonys semiconductor manufacturing operations, overall research and development costs within the segment only increased slightly as a result of the carrying out of a stringent process for the selection of research and development activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 119.2 billion yen, or 11.0 percent to 960.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The primary reason for this decrease was a decrease in restructuring charges. Of the restructuring charges recorded in the Electronics segment, the amount recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 71.4 billion yen from 125.0 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 53.6 billion yen. Of the restructuring charges recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, the amount recorded for headcount reductions, including reductions through the early retirement program, was 51.0 billion yen, a decrease of 63.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. On the other hand, royalty expenses increased 17.0 billion yen. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased 2.2 percentage points from the 21.2 percent recorded in the previous fiscal year to 19.0 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net decreased 6.7 billion yen to 23.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This amount includes 19.2 billion yen in restructuring charges, which includes 7.5 billion yen related to CRT and CRT televisions manufacturing facilities in Europe. The amount of restructuring charges included in loss on sale, disposal or impairment, net in the previous fiscal year was 10.6 billion yen. An increased operating loss was recorded in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 due to a significant deterioration in the cost of sales ratio, as mentioned above. Regarding profit performance by product, excluding restructuring charges, semiconductors recorded an operating loss for the fiscal year, compared to the operating profit of the previous fiscal year. This loss was due to the recording, within the Electronics segment, of research and development costs related to system large scale integration (LSI) manufacturing, in particular the next generation processor chip, as a result of the integration of Sonys semiconductor manufacturing business operations within the Electronics segment mentioned above. These costs were previously recorded within the Game segment. CRT televisions and portable audio products recorded a loss for the fiscal year compared to the operating income recorded in the previous fiscal year. DVD recorders (including PSX) also experienced an increased operating loss. The operating income for video cameras also decreased. On the other hand, results were positively affected by a decreased operating loss from personal digital assistants through the implementation of significant business downsizing, and a significant increase in operating income recorded for PCs and broadcast- and professional-use products. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Approximately 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 took place in Japan, including the production of digital cameras, video cameras, flat panel televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and Memory Sticks. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for approximately 10 percent of total annual production, approximately 70 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for slightly more than 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining total annual production of slightly less than 30 percent, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Comparison of Results on a Local Currency Basis and Results on a Yen Basis In the Electronics segment, the negative effect of the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar exceeded the positive effect of the appreciation of the Euro against the yen. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased, on a yen basis, by 1.1 percent, but increased on a local currency basis by approximately 1 percent. In terms of operating performance, there was a deterioration in the operating loss 52 Table of Contents compared to the previous fiscal year, but if calculated on a local currency basis, this operating loss was smaller compared to the actual results on a yen basis. Sales to outside customers by geographic area on a yen basis decreased in Japan by 10 percent, and in the U.S. by 4 percent: however, sales in Europe remained relatively unchanged and sales increased in Other Areas by 9 percent. Sales on a local currency basis for regions outside Japan increased in the U.S. by 1 percent and in Other Areas by 13 percent, but decreased in Europe by 2 percent. Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 50.5 billion yen, or 6.5 percent, to 729.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 24.4 billion yen, or 36.1 percent, to 43.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and the operating income margin decreased from 8.7 percent to 5.9 percent. Sales in the Game segment on a local currency basis decreased approximately 6 percent. In addition, on a local currency basis, operating income decreased approximately 45 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. By region, although sales increased in Japan, there was a decrease in sales in the U.S. and Europe. Hardware sales declined. Although there was an increase in sales in Japan primarily associated with the launch of PSP in December 2004, there was a decline in hardware sales in the U.S. and Europe associated with a decline in unit sales, and strategic price reductions, of PS2. On the other hand, both unit sales and overall sales of software increased in Japan, the U.S. and Europe. Total worldwide production shipments of hardware and software were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Cumulative as of 2004 2005 March 31, 2005 (Million units) Total Production Shipments of Hardware* PlayStation® + PS one 3.31 2.77 102.49 PlayStation 2 20.10 16.17 87.47 PlayStation Portable 2.97 2.97 Total Production Shipments of Software*/** PlayStation 32.00 10.00 959.00 PlayStation 2 222.00 252.00 824.00 PlayStation Portable 5.70 5.70 * Production shipments of hardware and software are counted upon shipment of the products from manufacturing bases. Sales of such products are recognized when the products are delivered to customers. ** Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. Operating income decreased compared with the previous fiscal year. Although there was an increase in software sales, the decrease in operating income was the result of a decrease in hardware sales coupled primarily with start up costs for the PSP. The cost of sales to sales ratio deteriorated as a result of costs associated with both the launch of the PSP and with the changeover to the new PS2 model. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales compared to the previous fiscal year was relatively unchanged. Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 22.7 billion yen, or 3.0 percent, to 733.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 28.7 billion yen, or 81.4 percent, to 63.9 billion yen and the operating income margin increased from 4.7 percent to 8.7 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of SPE, a U.S.-based subsidiary. 53 Table of Contents On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment increased approximately 1 percent and operating income increased by approximately 76 percent. Sales increased primarily due to higher worldwide home entertainment, international television syndication and worldwide theatrical revenues on films. Worldwide home entertainment and international television syndication revenues were higher as a result of the performance of films from the prior year release slate including 50 First Dates, Big Fish and Bad Boys 2. For theatrical revenues, the success of the current year film slate, particularly Spider-Man 2, Hitch and The Grudge, more than offset the impact of releasing fewer films this fiscal year. Sales for the fiscal year release slate decreased 70 million U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. However, sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 from the prior year release slate increased 304 million U.S. dollars as compared to sales in the previous fiscal year from the release slate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. While benefiting from higher theatrical revenues, total fiscal year release slate revenues were lower due to the timing of the fiscal years film slates release in the home entertainment market. The higher sales from films were partially offset by a 248 million U.S. dollar decrease in sales resulting from the absence in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 of several transactions in the television business that occurred in the prior fiscal year. These included syndication sales of King of Queens and Seinfeld as well as the extension of a licensing agreement for Wheel of Fortune. Television sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 benefited from the highly successful DVD release of Seinfeld. Operating income for the segment increased significantly, resulting in record operating income for the segment, due to the strong overall performance of the current fiscal years film slate and the home entertainment and international television syndication carryover performance of the prior fiscal years film slate noted above. Operating loss from the fiscal year release slate decreased 415 million U.S. dollars and operating income for the prior fiscal years release slate increased 173 million U.S. dollars as compared to the prior fiscal year. Spider-Man 2s worldwide success contributed substantially to this fiscal years earnings, offset somewhat by the disappointing theatrical performance of Spanglish. Further improving operating income was a 38 million U.S. dollar decrease in restructuring charges. Partially offsetting these increases in operating income was the impact of the absence of the television transactions noted above, which reduced operating income by approximately 150 million U.S. dollars due primarily to the factors noted above for revenue. As of March 31, 2005, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television product. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year that the product is available for broadcast. Financial Services Please note that the revenue and operating income at Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank discussed below differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 33.0 billion yen, or 5.6 percent, to 560.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 0.3 billion yen, or 0.6 percent, to 55.5 billion yen and the operating income margin increased to 9.9 percent compared with the 9.3 percent of the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue decreased by 38.7 billion yen, or 7.5 percent, to 474.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The main reasons for the decrease in revenue were a change in the method of recognizing insurance premiums received on certain products, as of the third quarter beginning October 1, 2003, from being recorded as revenues to being offset against the related provision for future insurance policy benefits, coupled with a small decrease in valuation gains in the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year in which significant valuation gains were recorded against stock conversion rights from convertible bonds. Although there was a decrease in insurance premium revenue as a result of the above mentioned change in accounting method, there were increases in insurance-in-force at the end of the fiscal year compared to the end of the previous fiscal year. Operating income at Sony Life decreased by 2.2 billion yen or 54 Table of Contents 3.4 percent to 61.0 billion yen, mainly due to a decrease in valuation gains against stock conversion rights from convertible bonds, although this was partially offset by an increase in revenue from insurance premiums excluding the effect of the change in revenue recognition method noted above. In addition, the impact on operating income from the change in revenue recognition method noted above was slight. At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by an expansion in automobile insurance-in-force. Operating income increased due to an increase in insurance revenue, although there was a deterioration in the loss ratio (the ratio of insurance payouts to premiums). At Sony Bank, which started operations in June 2001, revenue rose as there was an increase in interest revenue associated with an increase in the balance of assets from investing activities. Although revenue increased, an increase in operating expenses resulted in a relatively unchanged operating loss compared with the previous fiscal year. At Sony Finance, a leasing and credit financing business subsidiary in Japan, revenue decreased due to a fall in leasing revenue. In terms of profitability, the operating loss decreased due to the recording of a loss, in the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, from the lease of certain fixed assets to Crosswave Communications Inc (Crosswave), which commenced reorganization proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Law of Japan during the same fiscal year. Condensed Statements of Income Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of income for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services as well as condensed consolidated statements of income. This presentation is not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Condensed Statements of Income Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 (Yen in millions) Financial Services Financial service revenue 593,544 560,557 Financial service expenses 538,383 505,067 Operating income 55,161 55,490 Other income (expenses), net 1,958 10,204 Income before income taxes 57,119 65,694 Income taxes and other 22,975 25,698 Income before cumulative effect of an accounting change 34,144 39,996 Cumulative effect of an accounting change  (4,713 ) Net income 34,144 35,283 55 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 (Yen in millions) Sony without Financial Services Net sales and operating revenue 6,939,964 6,632,728 Costs and expenses 6,896,377 6,575,354 Operating income 43,587 57,374 Other income (expenses), net 52,746 40,639 Income before income taxes 96,333 98,013 Income taxes and other 30,916 (37,043 ) Income before cumulative effect of an accounting change 65,417 135,056 Cumulative effect of an accounting change (2,117 )  Net income 63,300 135,056 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 (Yen in millions) Consolidated Financial service revenue 565,752 537,715 Net sales and operating revenue 6,930,639 6,621,901 7,496,391 7,159,616 Costs and expenses 7,397,489 7,045,697 Operating income 98,902 113,919 Other income (expenses), net 45,165 43,288 Income before income taxes 144,067 157,207 Income taxes and other 53,439 (11,344 ) Income before cumulative effect of an accounting change 90,628 168,551 Cumulative effect of an accounting change (2,117 ) (4,713 ) Net income 88,511 163,838 All Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, sales within All Other were comprised mainly of sales from SMEJ; SMEIs recorded music business for the four months through August 1, 2004 prior to the establishment of SONY BMG; SMEIs music publishing business; SCN, an Internet-related service business subsidiary operating mainly in Japan; a retailer of imported general merchandise in Japan; an in-house facilities management business in Japan; and an advertising agency business in Japan. Results for the previous fiscal year in All Other include the consolidated results for SMEIs recorded music business for all twelve months, as well as the full years results for SMEIs publishing business and SMEJ. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 202.9 billion yen, or 30.6 percent, to 459.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of total segment sales, 82 percent were sales to outside customers. In terms of profit performance, operating income of 4.2 billion yen was recorded for All Other compared to the operating loss of 16.2 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, the significant sales decrease within All Other reflects the fact that, as noted above, the results for the twelve months of the previous fiscal year in All Other incorporated the results for SMEIs recorded music business. 56 Table of Contents Sales at SMEJ increased 5.7 percent compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in album and single sales. Best-selling albums and singles during the fiscal year included musiQ by ORANGE RANGE, SENTIMENTALovers by Ken Hirai and PORNO GRAFFITTI BEST BLUES by Porno Graffitti. Excluding sales recorded in Sonys music business, there was a decrease in sales within All Other. This was principally a result of a decrease in intersegment sales due to contract changes at a Japanese subsidiary involved in the advertising agency business. Regarding profit performance within All Other, operating income was recorded compared to the operating loss in the previous fiscal year as a result of significantly increased operating income at SMEJ due mainly to the higher sales noted above and an improvement in the cost of sales ratio associated with strong sales of greatest hits albums, coupled with reduced fixed costs at network related businesses within Sony Corporation, and a gain from the sale of a retail and showroom building in Japan. Operating income was recorded despite the absence in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 of a 7.7 billion yen one-time gain recorded at a business operated by a U.S. subsidiary on the sale of rights related to a portion of the Sony Credit Card portfolio in the previous fiscal year. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the average value of the yen was 106.5 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 133.7 yen against the Euro, which was 5.2 percent higher against the U.S. dollar and 1.9 percent lower against the Euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. Operating results on a local currency basis described in Overview and Operating Performance show results of sales and operating revenue and operating income obtained by applying the yens monthly average exchange rate in the previous fiscal year to monthly local currency-denominated sales, cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, as if the value of the yen had remained constant. In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S.-based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a local currency basis and results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. In addition, Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that local currency basis results provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. In All Other, Sony consolidates the yen-translated results of SMEI (a U.S.-based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis) and the results of SMEJ (a Japan-based operation that aggregates the results of its operations in yen). In addition, in All Other, results for this fiscal year only include the results of SMEIs recorded music business for the months of April through July 2004, and the twelve month results for SMEIs music publishing business and SMEJ. However, results for the previous fiscal year in All Other include the consolidated results for SMEIs recorded music business for all twelve months, as well as the full years results for SMEIs publishing business and SMEJ. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations mainly derived from the fact that the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. Sony Global Treasury Services Plc (SGTS) in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at 57 Table of Contents SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycle for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment utilized for portfolio investments. To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in Other Income and Expenses. The notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts, currency option contracts purchased and currency option contracts written as of March 31, 2005 were 1,545.8 billion yen, 428.3 billion yen and 146.5 billion yen, respectively. Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Assets Total assets on March 31, 2006 increased by 1,108.7 billion yen, or 11.7 percent, to 10,607.8 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total assets on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 364.4 billion yen, or 6.0 percent, to 6,392.3 billion yen and total assets on March 31, 2006 in the Financial Services segment increased by 680.1 billion yen, or 17.5 percent, to 4,565.6 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total assets on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment would have increased by approximately 2 percent compared with the previous fiscal year-end if the value of the yen had remained the same on March 31, 2006 as it was on March 31, 2005. Current Assets Current assets on March 31, 2006 increased by 213.4 billion yen, or 6.0 percent, to 3,769.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current assets on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 363.7 billion yen, or 14.0 percent, to 2,956.5 billion yen. Cash and cash equivalents on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased 65.7 billion yen, or 12.6 percent, to 585.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This is primarily a result of an increase in cash equivalents in association with the issuance of straight bonds carried out by Sony Corporation and the initial public offering of SCN. Notes and accounts receivable, trade (net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns) on March 31, 2006 excluding the Financial Services segment increased 21.0 billion yen, or 2.2 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year-end to 973.7 billion yen. Inventories on March 31, 2006 increased by 173.4 billion yen, or 27.5 percent, to 804.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily a result of both increased semiconductor inventory, primarily for use in PS3, and LCD television inventory in the Electronics segment and increased inventory in the Game segment resulting from the world-wide full-scale introduction of the PSP platform. The inventory to cost of sales turnover ratio (based on the average of inventories at the end of each 58 Table of Contents fiscal year and previous fiscal year) was 1.67 months compared to 1.56 months at the end of the previous fiscal year. Sony considers this level of inventory to be appropriate in the aggregate. Current assets on March 31, 2006 in the Financial Services segment decreased by 138.7 billion yen, or 14.0 percent, to 851.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This decrease was primarily attributable to the fact that cash and cash equivalents were utilized for investments and advances. Investments and Advances Investments and advances on March 31, 2006 increased by 774.2 billion yen, or 28.2 percent, to 3,519.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Investments and advances on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 31.6 billion yen, or 7.1 percent, to 477.1 billion yen. This was primarily a result of an increase in investments and advances towards affiliated companies such as MGM Holdings, Inc. Investments and advances on March 31, 2006 in the Financial Services segment increased by 749.8 billion yen, or 31.5 percent, to 3,128.7 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily due to investments mainly in Japanese fixed income securities resulting from an increase in insurance premiums at Sony Life, and an increase in mortgage loans at Sony Bank. Also see Investments below. Property, Plant and Equipment (after deduction of accumulated depreciation) Property, plant and equipment on March 31, 2006 increased by 16.1 billion yen, or 1.2 percent, to 1,388.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Property, plant and equipment on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 17.3 billion yen, or 1.3 percent, to 1,351.1 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Capital expenditures (part of the increase in property, plant and equipment) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 27.5 billion yen, or 7.7 percent, to 384.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the Electronics segment increased by 17.5 billion yen, or 5.6 percent, to 328.6 billion yen but decreased in the Game segment by 10.4 billion yen, or 55.3 percent, to 8.4 billion yen. Capital expenditures in the semiconductor business within the Electronics segment, including capital expenditures related to the Cell microprocessor, amounted to 140.0 billion yen. Capital expenditures in the Pictures segment increased by 4.3 billion yen, or 73.8 percent to 10.1 billion yen. In All Other, which includes Sonys consolidated music business, 4.2 billion yen of capital expenditures were recorded, compared to the 9.0 billion yen of capital expenditures recorded in the previous fiscal year. Property, plant and equipment on March 31, 2006 in the Financial Services segment decreased by 1.1 billion yen, or 2.9 percent, to 37.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Capital expenditures in the Financial Services segment increased by 0.6 billion yen, or 15.9 percent, to 4.5 billion yen. Other Assets Other assets on March 31, 2006 increased by 23.5 billion yen, or 1.5 percent, to 1,569.4 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Other assets on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 129.6 billion yen to 1,059.8 billion yen. Deferred tax assets on March 31, 2006 decreased by 61.6 billion yen, or 25.6 percent, to 178.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was due to the recording of additional valuation allowances against deferred tax assets by Sony Corporation and several of Sonys Japanese domestic and overseas consolidated subsidiaries, mainly within the Electronics segment due to continued losses recorded at these businesses. 59 Table of Contents Other assets in the Financial Services segment on March 31, 2006 increased by 70.2 billion yen, or 14.7 percent, to 548.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Liabilities Total current and long-term liabilities on March 31, 2006 increased by 761.9 billion yen, or 11.5 percent, to 7,366.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total current and long-term liabilities on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 185.5 billion yen, or 5.5 percent, to 3,551.9 billion yen. Total current and long-term liabilities in the Financial Services segment on March 31, 2006 increased by 512.3 billion yen, or 14.8 percent, to 3,977.6 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total current and long-term liabilities on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment would have increased by approximately 2 percent compared with the previous fiscal year-end if the value of the yen had remained the same on March 31, 2006 as it was on March 31, 2005. Current Liabilities Current liabilities on March 31, 2006 increased by 390.9 billion yen, or 13.9 percent, to 3,200.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current liabilities on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 191.8 billion yen, or 9.0 percent, to 2,329.3 billion yen. Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased 21.1 billion yen, or 10.3 percent, to 225.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was principally a result of an increase in the current portion of long-term debt. Notes and accounts payable, trade on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 3.1 billion yen, or 0.4 percent, to 804.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current liabilities on March 31, 2006 in the Financial Services segment increased by 209.7 billion yen, or 29.6 percent, to 918.3 billion yen, mainly due to an increase in short-term borrowing and an increase in deposits from customers at Sony Bank. Long-term Liabilities Long-term liabilities on March 31, 2006 increased by 371.0 billion yen, or 9.8 percent, to 4,166.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Long-term liabilities on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 6.3 billion yen, or 0.5 percent, to 1,222.6 billion yen. In addition, Long-term debt on March 31, 2006 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased 74.0 billion yen, or 11.8 percent, to 701.4 billion yen. Long-term debt increased primarily due to the issuance of straight bonds in order to redeem bonds maturing during the fiscal years ending March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007. Long-term liabilities decreased, as accrued pension and severance costs decreased by 169.3 billion yen, or 50.1 percent, to 168.8 billion yen, principally as a result of the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Long-term liabilities on March 31, 2006 in the Financial Services segment increased by 302.6 billion yen, or 11.0 percent, to 3,059.3 billion yen. This was due to an increase in insurance-in-force in the life insurance business which resulted in an increase in future insurance policy benefits and other of 280.0 billion yen, or 11.4 percent, to 2,744.3 billion yen. Total Interest-bearing Debt Total interest-bearing debt on March 31, 2006 increased by 192.0 billion yen, or 21.1 percent, to 1,101.2 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total interest-bearing debt on March 31, 2006 60 Table of Contents in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 95.1 billion yen, or 11.4 percent, to 926.5 billion yen. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity on March 31, 2006 increased by 333.5 billion yen, or 11.6 percent, to 3,203.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Retained earnings increased 96.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end, and accumulated other comprehensive income (net of tax) was 156.4 billion yen. This was primarily due to comprehensive income of 140.5 billion yen arising from foreign currency translation adjustments in current fiscal year due to the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the recording of a change in accumulated other comprehensive income of 38.1 billion yen arising from unrealized gains on securities in the current fiscal year. The ratio of stockholders equity to total assets remained unchanged at 30.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year-end. Condensed Balance Sheets Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows an unaudited condensed balance sheet for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services as well as the condensed consolidated balance sheet. This presentation is not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated 61 Table of Contents financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

Factors that are considered by Sony in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of issuers credit condition, sovereign risk, and whether or not Sony is able to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. 64 Table of Contents In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities with readily determinable fair values, management presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally a period of up to six to twelve months). The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of other factors which overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is not more than 20 percent or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors which may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary is often judgmental in nature and involves certain assumptions and estimates concerning the expected operating results, business plans and future cash flows of the issuer of the security. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that Sony currently believes to be temporary may be determined to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of additional information such as continued poor operating results, future broad declines in value of worldwide equity markets and the effect of world wide interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized into income in future periods. The following table contains available for sale and held to maturity securities, breaking out the unrealized gains and losses by investment category.

Sony Life principally invests in debt securities in various industries. Most securities were rated BBB or better by Standard & Poors, Moodys or others. As of March 31, 2006, Sony Life had debt and equity securities which had gross unrealized losses of 15.1 billion yen and 1.1 billion yen, respectively. Of the unrealized loss amounts recorded by Sony Life, less than 1 percent relate to securities being in an unrealized loss position of greater than 12 months. These unrealized losses related to numerous investments, with no single investment being in a material unrealized loss position. In addition, there was no individual security with unrealized losses that met 65 Table of Contents the test discussed above for impairment as the declines in value were observed to be small both in amounts and percentage, and therefore, the decline in value for those investments was still determined to be temporary in nature. The percentage of non-investment grade securities held by Sony Life represents approximately 1 percent of Sony Lifes total investment portfolio, while the percentage of unrealized losses that relate to those non-investment grade securities was approximately 2 percent of Sony Lifes total unrealized losses as of March 31, 2006. For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Life as of March 31, 2006 (15.1 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year: 5 percent  1 to 5 years: 44 percent  5 to 10 years: 50 percent Sony also maintains long-term investment securities issued by a number of non-public companies. The aggregate carrying amount of the investments in non-public companies at March 31, 2006 was 59.6 billion yen. A non-public equity investment is valued at cost as fair value is not readily determinable. If the value is estimated to have declined and such decline is judged to be other than temporary, the impairment of the investment is recognized and the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, total impairment losses were 16.7 billion yen, 4.2 billion yen and 4.0 billion yen of which 0.2 billion yen, 0.5 billion yen and 0.2 billion yen, respectively, were recorded by Sony Life in Financial Services revenue (refer to Financial Services under Operating Performance by Business Segment for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005). Impairment losses other than at Sony Life in each of the three fiscal years were reflected in non-operating expenses and primarily relate to the certain strategic investments in non-financial services businesses. These investments primarily relate to the certain strategic investments in Japan, the U.S. and Europe with which Sony has strategic relationships for the purposes of developing and marketing new technologies. The impairment losses were recorded for each of the three fiscal years as these companies failed to successfully develop and market such technology, the operating performance of the companies was more unfavorable than previously expected and the decline in fair value of these companies was judged as other-than-temporary. None of these impairment losses was individually material to Sony, except for the devaluation of securities explained in Other Income and Expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004. Upon determination that the value of an investment is impaired, the value of the investment is written down to its fair value. For publicly traded investments, fair value is determined by the closing stock price as of the date on which the impairment determination is made. For non-public investments, fair value is determined through the use of such methodologies as discounted cash flows, valuation of recent financings and comparable valuations of similar companies. The impairment losses that were recorded in each of the three years related to the unique facts and circumstances of each individual investment and did not significantly impact other investments. Sony Life and Sony Banks investments constitute the majority of the investments in the Financial Services segment. Sony Life and Sony Bank account for approximately 82 percent and 16 percent of the investments of the Financial Services segment, respectively. Sony Lifes fundamental investment policy is to build an investment portfolio capable of ensuring stable mid- to long-term returns through the efficient investment of funds, taking into account both expected returns and investment risks and responding flexibly to changes in financial conditions and the investment environment, while maintaining a sound asset base. Moreover, as its fundamental stance towards Asset Liability Management (ALM), a method of managing interest rate fluctuation risk through the comprehensive identification of differences in duration and cash flows between assets and liabilities, Sony Life takes the distinct characteristics of liability into account in order to control price fluctuation risks and establish a portfolio that ensures a certain level of returns. Sony Life adjusts its investing style depending on changes in the investment environment, in the first half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, when stock prices in Japan remained low, Sony Life invested mainly in convertible bonds, while in the second half of the fiscal year 66 Table of Contents ended March 31, 2006, when interest rates in Japan started to trend upward, Sony Life invested mainly in long-term Japanese government bonds. Sony Bank operates using a similar basic investment policy as Sony Life, taking expected returns and investment risks into account in order to disperse associated risks, and structuring its asset portfolio to ensure steady returns from investments. In addition, Sony Bank is careful to match the duration of its asset portfolio with the duration of liabilities resulting from customer deposits, in order to ensure that significant discrepancies do not occur. Government bonds and corporate bonds in yen or other currencies constitute a majority of Sony Banks current portfolio. To safeguard its assets Sony Bank does not invest in equity securities but invests in various types of government and corporate bonds in many countries, companies and industries, to diversify associated risks. With respect to loans, Sony Bank mainly offers housing loans to individuals and does not have any corporate loan exposure. Contractual obligations, commitments, and contingent liabilities The following table summarizes Sonys contractual obligations and major commitments as of March 31, 2006. References to Note below represents a particular note within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 to After Total 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 5 Year (Yen in millions) Contractual Obligations and Major Commitments:* Long-term debt (Note 11) Capital lease obligations (Notes 8 and 11) 38,280 16,966 12,642 4,342 4,330 Other long-term debt (Note 11) 920,173 176,589 306,063 172,851 264,670 Minimum rental payments required under operating leases (Note 8) 195,537 47,500 61,244 27,861 58,932 Purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment and other assets (Note 23) 69,286 65,135 4,124 27  Expected cost for the production or purchase of films and television programming or certain rights (Note 23) 76,736 50,578 25,926 213 19 Partnership program contract with Fédération Internationale de Football Association (Note 23) 34,639 3,875 7,750 8,660 14,354 * The total amount of expected future pension payments is not included in the above table or the total amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2006 discussed below as such amount is not currently determinable. Sony expects to contribute approximately 33.0 billion yen to the Japanese pension plans and approximately 6.0 billion yen to the foreign pension plans during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007 (Note 14). * The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under loan agreements in the Financial Services segment is not included in the above table or the amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2006 discussed below as it is not foreseeable how many loans will be executed. The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under these contracts was 326.7 billion yen as of March 31, 2006 (Note 23). * The 5 year Revolving Credit Agreement with Sony BMG, which matures on August 5, 2009 and provides for a base commitment of 300 million U.S. dollars and additional incremental borrowings of up to 150 million U.S. dollars, is not included in the above table or the amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2006 67 Table of Contents discussed below as such amount is not currently determinable. Sonys outstanding commitment under this Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2006 was 26.3 billion yen (Note 23). The total amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2006 was 285.8 billion yen (Note 23). The commitments include major purchase obligations as shown above. In the ordinary course of business, Sony makes commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. As of March 31, 2006, such commitments outstanding were 69.3 billion yen. A subsidiary in the Pictures segment has committed to fund a portion of the production cost of completed films and is responsible for all distribution and marketing expenses relating to these films under a distribution agreement with a third party. Further, certain subsidiaries in the Pictures segment have entered into agreements with creative talent for the development and production of films and television programming as well as agreements with third parties to acquire completed films, or certain rights therein. As of March 31, 2006, the total amount of the expected cost for the production or purchase of films and television programming or certain rights under the above commitments was 76.7 billion yen. Sony Corporation has entered into a partnership program contract with Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Through this program Sony Corporation will be able to exercise various rights as an official sponsor of FIFA events from 2007 to 2014. As of March 31, 2006, Sony Corporation was committed to make payments under such contract of 34.6 billion yen. In order to fulfill its commitments, Sony will use cash generated by its operating activities, intra-group loans and borrowings from subsidiaries with excess funds to subsidiaries that are short of funds through its finance subsidiaries, and raise funds from the global capital markets and from banks when necessary. The following table summarizes Sonys contingent liabilities as of March 31, 2006. Total Amounts of Contingent Liabilities (Yen in millions) Contingent Liabilities: (Note 23) Loan guarantees to related parties 9,325 Other 11,747 Total contingent liabilities 21,072 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Sony has several off-balance sheet arrangements to provide liquidity, capital resources and/or credit risk support. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony entered into new accounts receivable sales programs that provide for the accelerated receipt of up to 47.5 billion yen of eligible trade accounts receivable of Sony Corporation. Through these programs, Sony can sell receivables to special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. These transactions are accounted for as a sale in accordance with FAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, accounts receivable sold under these transactions are excluded from receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The initial sale of these receivables was in March 2005, and Sony sold a total of 10.0 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Sony sold a total of 146.2 billion yen of receivables during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. Although Sony continues servicing the sold receivables, no servicing liabilities are recorded because costs regarding collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. Through May 2005, Sony had set up an accounts receivable securitization program in the United States that provided for the accelerated receipt of up to 500 million U.S. dollars of cash on eligible trade accounts receivable of Sonys U.S. electronics subsidiary. Through this program, Sony could securitize and sell a percentage of an undivided interest in that pool of receivables to several multi-seller commercial paper 68 Table of Contents conduits owned and operated by a bank. These securitization transactions were accounted for as a sale in accordance with FAS No. 140, because Sony had relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, accounts receivable sold under these transactions were excluded from receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. During the period from April 2004 to January 2005, Sony sold a total of 80.3 billion yen of accounts receivable under this program. There were no outstanding amounts due at March 31, 2005 relating to the existing undivided interests in the pool of receivables that had been sold. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. This program was terminated in May 2005. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the accounts receivable securitization. In addition, a subsidiary in the Picture segment entered into a production/co-financing agreement with a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) on December 30, 2005, to co-finance 11 films scheduled to be released over the following 15 months. The subsidiary is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and therefore does not consolidate the results of the VIE. Under the production/co-financing agreement, the subsidiary will receive approximately 400 million U.S. dollars over the term of the agreement. The subsidiary is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIE shares in the net profits of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs. As of March 31, 2006, only one co-financed film has been released by the subsidiary. The subsidiary did not make any equity investment in the VIE nor does it issue any guarantees with respect to the VIE. In April 2006, the subsidiary entered into a second production/co-financing agreement with a VIE to co-finance an additional 11 films scheduled to be released over the following 24 months. The subsidiary will receive approximately 330 million U.S. dollars over the term of the agreement. Similar to the first agreement, the subsidiary is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIE shares in the net profits of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs. Sony has, from time to time, entered into various arrangements with VIEs. In several of the arrangements in which Sony holds a significant variable interest, Sony is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates these VIEs. These arrangements include facilities which provide for the leasing of certain property, the financing of film production, the implementation of a stock option plan for Japanese employees and the U.S.-based music publishing business. The assets and liabilities associated with certain of these arrangements previously qualified for off-balance sheet treatment. In addition, Sony holds a significant variable interest in VIEs in which Sony is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate. These VIEs include the film production/co-financing arrangements noted above. Cash Flows (The fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005) Operating Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, Sony generated 399.9 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of 247.1 billion yen, or 38.2 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment generated 252.0 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of 233.5 billion yen, or 48.1 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment generated 147.1 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of 20.9 billion yen, or 12.5 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, there was a positive impact on operating cash flow mainly from the effect of the profit contribution from the Financial Services segment, and after taking account of depreciation and amortization, as well as the effect of the loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net. However, primarily offsetting these contributions was an increase in inventory, particularly within the Electronics and Game segments, the effect of the non-cash net gain on the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of the employee pension fund, an increase in deferred acquisition costs within the Financial Services segment and effect of the gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees. 69 Table of Contents Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities decreased mainly as a result of taking into account the lower net income recorded during the fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year, and, as noted above, the increase in inventory during the fiscal year compared with the previous fiscal year, the effect of the gain on the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of the employee pension fund, and of the gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year, Sony used 871.3 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an decrease of 59.9 billion yen, or 6.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment used 296.4 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an decrease of 175.7 billion yen, or 37.2 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment used 563.8 billion yen in net cash, an increase of 142.4 billion yen, or 33.8 percent. During the fiscal year, purchases of fixed assets (capital expenditures) were made, primarily due to proactive capital expenditures in semiconductors mainly within the Electronics segment, mostly associated with image sensors. Within the Financial Services segment, payments for investments and advances exceeded proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances primarily as a result of investments in mainly Japanese fixed income securities resulting from an increase in insurance premiums at Sony Life, and an increase in the outstanding balance of mortgage loans at Sony Bank. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities decreased, due primarily to the fact that in the previous fiscal year, investments were carried out principally in relation to S-LCD and in semiconductor fabrication equipment, particularly investments associated with the advanced microprocessor Cell On the other hand, within the Financial Services segment, net cash used in investing activities increased due to an increase in investments and advances compared to the previous fiscal year. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the difference between cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities was a use of cash of 44.4 billion yen, as compared to the 13.3 billion yen of cash generated in the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, 359.9 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities. Of the total, 74.6 billion yen of net cash was generated from financing activities in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment compared to a use of net cash in the previous fiscal year of 95.4 billion yen. This was a result of straight bonds issued in order to redeem bonds maturing during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007. In the Financial Services segment, as a result of an increase in policyholder accounts at Sony Life, and an increase in deposits from customers, as well as call loan borrowings carried out at Sony Bank, 274.9 billion yen of net cash was generated by financing activities. Accounting for all these factors and the effect of exchange rate changes, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year decreased by 76.0 billion yen, or 9.8 percent, to 703.1 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. The total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 65.7 billion yen, or 12.6 percent, to 585.5 billion yen, and for the Financial Services segment, decreased by 141.7 billion, or 54.6 percent, to 117.6 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. Condensed Statements of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of cash flow for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment as well as condensed consolidated statements of cash flow. These presentations are not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and 70 Table of Contents all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Condensed Statements of Cash Flows Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2005 2006 (Yen in millions) Financial Services Net cash provided by operating activities 168,078 147,149 Net cash used in investing activities (421,384 ) (563,753 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 256,361 274,863 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 3,055 (141,741 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the fiscal year 256,316 259,371 Cash and cash equivalents at end of the fiscal year 259,371 117,630 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2005 2006 (Yen in millions) Sony without Financial Services Net cash provided by operating activities 485,439 251,975 Net cash used in investing activities (472,119 ) (296,376 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (95,373 ) 74,600 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 8,890 35,537 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (73,163 ) 65,736 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the fiscal year 592,895 519,732 Cash and cash equivalents at end of the fiscal year 519,732 585,468 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2005 2006 (Yen in millions) Consolidated Net cash provided by operating activities 646,997 399,858 Net cash used in investing activities (931,172 ) (871,264 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 205,177 359,864 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 8,890 35,537 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (70,108 ) (76,005 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the fiscal year 849,211 779,103 Cash and cash equivalents at end of the fiscal year 779,103 703,098 Cash Flows (The fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004) Operating Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony generated 647.0 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a increase of 14.4 billion yen, or 2.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment generated 485.4 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a increase of 84.3 billion yen, or 21.0 percent, compared with the previous 71 Table of Contents fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment generated 168.1 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of 73.5 billion yen, or 30.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, in addition to profit contributions from the Pictures segment, Financial Services segment, Game segment and All Other and depreciation expenses, operating cash flow benefited from an increase in notes and accounts payable, trade, primarily associated with an increase in sales and procurement related primarily to the PSP within the Game segment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, a decrease in notes and accounts receivable, trade, associated with a sales decrease in the Pictures segment during the fourth quarter and within All Other associated with the decrease in sales after August 2004, and a decrease in inventory mainly within the Game and Electronics segments. Partially offsetting these contributions were factors including an increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade primarily within the Game segment. In addition, in the Financial Services segment, an increase in future insurance policy benefits and other, due to an increase in insurance-in-force, contributed to operating cash flow in the Financial Services segment. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities increased, due to a decrease in inventory during the fiscal year compared to an increase in inventory in the previous fiscal year, and there was a smaller increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade, compared with the previous fiscal year associated with the decrease in sales. These factors were partially offset by factors such as a smaller increase in notes and accounts payable, trade. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year, Sony used 931.2 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 169.4 billion yen, or 22.2 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment used 472.1 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 119.6 billion yen, or 33.9 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment used 421.4 billion yen in net cash, an increase of 19.8 billion yen, or 4.9 percent. During the fiscal year, purchases of fixed assets (capital expenditures) were made, primarily due to proactive capital expenditures in semiconductors mainly within the Electronics segment, mostly associated with system LSI including the advanced microprocessor Cell as well as investments associated with the establishment of the amorphous TFT LCD panel manufacturing joint venture S-LCD. Within the Financial Services segment, payments for investments and advances exceeded proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances primarily as a result of investments in mainly Japanese fixed income securities resulting from an increase in insurance premiums at Sony Life, and a mortgage loan campaign carried out at Sony Bank. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities increased, due primarily to investments associated with S-LCD. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the amount of payments for investments and advances increased by 124.8 billion yen from 33.3 billion yen to 158.2 billion yen due to the abovementioned investments at S-LCD. On the other hand, in the Financial Services segment, net cash used in investing activities increased due to an increase in proceeds from investments and advances year on year. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the difference between cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities was 13.3 billion yen for the fiscal year, a decrease of 35.3 billion yen, or 72.6 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, 205.2 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities. Of the total, 95.4 billion yen of net cash was used for financing activities in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment as a result of 89.7 billion yen being used for the repayment of long term debt and 23.0 billion yen in cash being used for the payment of dividends. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, net cash was used for financing activities compared to 153.8 billion yen of net cash procured in the previous fiscal year. This change was due mainly to the issuance of 250.0 billion yen in Euro yen convertible bonds (bonds with stock acquisition rights) within the previous fiscal year. 72 Table of Contents In the Financial Services segment, as a result of a 294.4 billion yen increase in customer deposits due to factors such as an increase in insurance-in-force at Sony Life and an increase in deposits from customers at Sony Bank, 256.4 billion yen was procured by financing activities. Accounting for all these factors and the effect of exchange rate changes, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year decreased by 70.1 billion yen, or 8.3 percent, to 779.1 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. The total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 73.2 billion yen, or 12.3 percent, to 519.7 billion yen, and for the Financial Services segment, increased by 3.1 billion, or 1.2 percent, to 259.4 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year.

Condensed Statements of Cash Flows Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 (Yen in millions) Financial Services Net cash provided by operating activities 241,627 168,078 Net cash used in investing activities (401,550 ) (421,384 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 141,696 256,361 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (18,227 ) 3,055 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the fiscal year 274,543 256,316 Cash and cash equivalents at end of the fiscal year 256,316 259,371 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 (Yen in millions) Sony without Financial Services Net cash provided by operating activities 401,090 485,439 Net cash used in investing activities (352,496 ) (472,119 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 153,759 (95,373 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (47,973 ) 8,890 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 154,380 (73,163 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the fiscal year 438,515 592,895 Cash and cash equivalents at end of the fiscal year 592,895 519,732 73 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2004 2005 (Yen in millions) Consolidated Net cash provided by operating activities 632,635 646,997 Net cash used in investing activities (761,792 ) (931,172 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 313,283 205,177 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (47,973 ) 8,890 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 136,153 (70,108 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the fiscal year 713,058 849,211 Cash and cash equivalents at end of the fiscal year 849,211 779,103 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sonys financial policy is to secure adequate liquidity, to ensure the smooth financing of its operations and to maintain the strength of its balance sheet. Sony intends to continue both structural reform and various investments for future growth. Sony believes that it can maintain sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to satisfy its various capital needs, including funding requirements that arise from its business strategy, working capital needs, repayment of existing debt, payment of dividends and all its other capital needs, through cash flows and cash and cash equivalents, its ability to procure necessary funds from the financial and capital markets, its commitment lines with banks, and other means. Market Access Sony Corporation and SGTS, a finance subsidiary in the U.K., procure funds from the financial and capital markets. In order to meet long-term funding requirements, Sony Corporation utilizes its access to global equity and bond markets. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, based on a bond shelf registration filed in Japan, Sony issued three series of straight bonds totaling 120 billion yen in September 2005 for the purpose of debt redemption, and another three series of straight bonds totaling 100 billion yen in February 2006 for the redemption bonds maturing during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007, respectively. As the total amount of shelf registrations outstanding decreased after these bond issues, Sony filed a new shelf registration of 300 billion yen in April 2006, which is effective for two years. In order to meet the working capital requirements of Sony, SGTS maintains commercial paper (CP) programs and a medium-term note (MTN) program. SGTS maintains CP programs for the U.S., Euro and Japanese CP markets. As of March 31, 2006, the total amount of these CP programs was 1,321.9 billion yen. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the largest month-end outstanding balance of CP was 111.4 billion yen in September 2005. There was no outstanding balance of CP as of March 31, 2006. SGTS maintains a Euro MTN program of whose amount as of March 31, 2006 was 587.1 billion yen. There was no outstanding balance as of March 31, 2006. Sony Capital Corporation (SCC), a Sony finance subsidiary in the U.S., had an outstanding MTN balance of approximately 58.7 billion yen as of March 31, 2006. However, Sony does not intend to utilize SCCs program for future financing requirements as SCCs financing function was integrated into that of SGTS. Liquidity Management Sonys working capital needs grow significantly in the third quarter (from October to December) as a result of the general seasonality to Sonys business. Sonys basic liquidity management policy is to secure sufficient liquidity throughout the relevant fiscal year, covering such factors as short-term cash flow volatility 74 Table of Contents mentioned above, repayments for debts whose due date fall within a year, and possible downward earnings risk due to changes in the business environment. Sony defines its liquidity sources as the amount of cash, cash equivalents (cash balance), and committed lines of credit contracted with financial institutions. Regarding its cash balance, Sonys policy is to maintain more than a certain level of cash balance to absorb any working capital needs daily and monthly. The balance of cash and marketable securities on March 31, 2006, was 589.5 billion yen. A short-term shortage in the cash balance is financed by the issuance of CP. However, Sony controls the outstanding CP amount through internal limits as part of its short-term debt risk management strategy. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, there was no outstanding CP amount. As part of its additional liquidity sources, Sony has a total of 683.4 billion yen in committed lines of credit with various financial institutions, of which the unused amount was 676.4 billion yen as of March 31, 2006. Major committed lines of credit include a total of 502.6 billion yen of Global Commitment Facilities contracted with a syndicate of global banks, and a 150 billion yen of committed line of credit contracted with Japanese financial institutions. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, Sony reorganized the total amount and composition of terms to maturity of both facilities. With regards to the Global Commitment Facilities, as of March 31, 2005, Sony had two facilities consisting of a 5-year contract (amount as of March 31, 2005 is 459.4 billion yen, maturity March 2009) and a 364-day contract (amount as of March 31, 2005 is 114.9 billion yen) totaling 574.3 billion yen. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the 364-day portion was terminated. With regards to the committed line with Japanese financial institutions, as of March 31, 2005, Sony had two facilities consisting of a 100 billion yen 3-year contract and a 150 billion yen 364-day contract, totaling 250 billion yen. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, upon expiry of the 3-year contract, Sony newly entered into a 150 billion yen 3-year contract (maturing in July 2008) while the 364-day contract was terminated. As a result, although the total amount of the facilities has been reduced by 185.3 billion yen compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony believes it maintains long-term secured and sufficient liquidity. Sony uses these lines for general corporate purposes, including the support of CP programs and for emergency purposes. There are no financial covenants in any of Sonys material financial agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in Sonys credit ratings. However, a downgrade in Sonys credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings. There are no restrictions on how Sonys borrowings can be used except that some borrowings may not be used to acquire securities listed on a U.S. exchange or traded over-the-counter in U.S., and use of such borrowings must comply with the rules and regulations issued by authorities such as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. Ratings Sony considers it to be one of managements top priorities to maintain a stable and appropriate credit rating in order to ensure financial flexibility for liquidity and capital management, and to continue to maintain adequate access to sufficient funding resources in the financial and capital markets. In order to facilitate access to global capital markets, Sony obtains credit ratings from two rating agencies, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Standard and Poors Rating Services (S&P). In addition, Sony maintains a rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), a rating agency in Japan, for access to the Japanese capital market. Sonys current debt ratings from each agency are noted below: Moodys S&P R&I Long-term debt A2 (Outlook: Stable) A- Outlook: Stable) AA- (Outlook: Stable) Short-term debt P-1 A-2 a-1+ S&P downgraded Sonys long-term debt rating from A to A- and short-term debt rating from A-1 to A-2 in October 2005, R&I downgraded Sonys long-term debt rating from AA to AA- in November 2005 and Moodys downgraded Sonys long-term debt rating from A1 to A2 in December 2005, respectively. Sonys short-term debt rating from Moodys and R&I have been unaffected. These downgrades of debt ratings 75 Table of Contents reflected rating agencies concern mainly of low profitability in the Electronics segment and the low level of Sonys cash flows. The outlook after the downgrades of long-term debt ratings from the three agencies is stable. Despite these downgrades of debt ratings, Sony believes its access to the global capital markets and ability to issue CP for its working capital needs have not been restricted. Cash Management Sony is centralizing and working to make more efficient its global cash management activities through SGTS. The excess or shortage of cash at most of Sonys subsidiaries is invested or funded by SGTS after having been netted out, although Sony recognizes that fund transfers are limited in certain countries and geographical areas due to restrictions on capital transactions. In order to pursue more efficient cash management, Sony manages uneven cash distribution among its subsidiaries directly or indirectly through SGTS so that Sony can reduce unnecessary cash and cash equivalents as well as borrowings as much as possible. The above description covers liquidity and capital resources for consolidated Sony excluding the Financial Services segment which secure liquidity on their own. Financial Services segment In the Financial Services segment, the management of SFH, Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank recognize the importance of securing sufficient liquidity to cover the payment obligations that they take on as a result of their ordinary course of business, and these companies abide by the regulations imposed by regulatory authorities and establish and operate under company guidelines that comply with these regulations. Their purpose in doing so is to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and secure sufficient means to pay their obligations. For instance, Sony Lifes cash inflows come mainly from policyholders insurance premiums and Sony Life keeps sufficient liquidity in the form of investments primarily in various securities. Sony Bank, on the other hand, uses its cash inflows, which come mainly from customers deposits in local or foreign currencies, in order to offer mortgage loans to individuals or to make bond investments, and establish a necessary level of liquidity for the smooth settlement of transactions. Sony Life currently obtains ratings from five rating agencies: A+ by S&P for long-term counterparty and insurer financial strength rating, Aa3 by Moodys for insurance financial strength rating, A+ by AM Best Company Inc. for financial strength rating, and AA by R&I for insurance claims paying ability and AA by the Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd for ability to pay insurance claims. Sony Bank obtained an A-/ A-2 rating from S&P for its long-term/short-term local/foreign currency issuer ratings. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT In its mid-term corporate strategy announced on September 22, 2005, Sony stressed that the most pressing issue confronting the company today is the revitalization of its electronics business. The strengthening of the competitiveness of Sonys technologies and its products is an important element of both the revitalization of the Electronics business and the companys growth strategy, and Sony considers research and development activities that support this competitiveness will remain pivotal to its mid- to long term strategy. Research and Development is focused in three key domains: a common development platform technology for home and mobile electronics; semiconductor and device technology essential for product differentiation and for creating added-value to products; and software technology. Reflecting Sonys mid-term corporate strategy, in October 2005, the company established the Display Device Development Group, to accelerate the development of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, and the Technology Development Group, to strengthen software development. Moreover, Sony continues to strengthen the fundamental research and development structure at three of its corporate laboratories, Information Technology Laboratories (communication and security technologies), Material Laboratories (material and device technologies) and A3 Laboratories (signal processing technologies). 76 Table of Contents Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased 29.8 billion yen, or 5.9 percent, to 531.8 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to net sales (which excludes Financial service revenue and other operating revenue) increased from 7.6 percent to 7.9 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment decreased 15.2 billion yen, or 3.5 percent, to 418.1 billion yen, whereas expenses in the Game segment increased 40.2 billion yen, or 58.7 percent, to 108.7 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 64 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 36 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications, displays and next generation optical discs. In addition, within the Game segment, there was an increase primarily of hardware-related research and development costs associated with PS3. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased 12.5 billion yen, or 2.4 percent, to 502.0 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to net sales increased from 7.5 percent to 7.6 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment increased 2.4 billion yen, or 0.6 percent, to 433.3 billion yen, and expenses in the Game segment decreased 14.9 billion yen, or 17.9 percent, to 68.5 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 62 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 38 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications, displays and next generation optical discs. There was an increase in research and development costs related to semiconductor process technology associated with the transfer of Sony Computer Entertainments semiconductor manufacturing operations from the Game segment to the Electronics segment. However, the stringent selection of research and development activities resulted in a small increase in research and development expenses within the Electronics segment. Research and development expenses in the Game segment remained high due to the research and development associated with PSP and PS3. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 were 514.5 billion yen. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments; expenses in the Electronics segment were 431.0 billion yen, and expenses in the Game segment were 83.4 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 62 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining approximately 38 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications, displays and next generation optical discs. TREND INFORMATION This section contains forward-looking statements about the possible future performance of Sony and should be read in light of the cautionary statement on that subject, which appears on the inside front cover page and which applies to this entire document. Issues Facing Sony and Managements Response to those Issues Competition in many of Sonys business segments continues to intensify and price erosion, especially in the Electronics segment, remains persistent. Competition has intensified due to the penetration of broadband, which has led to an augmentation of network infrastructure, making it easier for companies in other sectors to enter the markets in which Sony competes. In response to these challenges, Sony has been undertaking initiatives to improve its competitiveness and strengthen the quality of its management, such as a reduction in the number of business categories and the number of models, a rationalization of manufacturing sites and the creation of a more efficient administrative structure, as well as the sale of non-core assets (See Restructuring in Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects for more detailed information about restructuring). This plan, developed in consultation with Sonys stakeholders both inside and outside the company, moved to strengthen Sonys competitiveness in three core sectors  Electronics, Game and Entertainment  through a balanced mix of restructuring and growth initiatives combined with a new organizational structure. In particular, it is the revitalization of 77 Table of Contents Electronics that management regards as the most pressing issue confronting Sony today. As well as reorganizing its Electronics business to place centralized decision-making authority over key areas under the Electronics CEO, Sony is implementing reorganization initiatives to strengthen horizontal coordination in the key areas of product planning, technology, procurement, manufacturing, and sales and marketing. For Sonys growth strategy in Electronics, resources will be focused on the development and commercialization of high-definition products, mobile products and advanced semiconductors and other key devices that can further differentiate these products, targeting enhanced competitiveness and improved profitability. In addition to this cost-cutting and investment for growth, each of Sonys business segments grappled with issues specific to that segment. Below is a description of the issues management believes each segment continues to face and an explanation as to how each segment is approaching those issues. Electronics Although the Electronics segment continues to hold a very strong position in the worldwide consumer audio visual products market, that position has become increasingly threatened as a result of the entrance of new manufacturers and distributors. These new entrants are threatening Sonys position due to the industry shift from analog to digital technology. In the analog era, complicated functionality of electronics products was made possible through the combination of several complex parts, and Sony held a competitive advantage in the design and manufacture of those parts as a result of its accumulated expertise. In the digital era, however, complicated functionality has become concentrated on semiconductors and other key digital devices. Since these semiconductors and key devices are able to be mass produced, they have become readily available to new market entrants, and the functionality that once commanded a high premium has become more affordable. This has led to intense price erosion in the consumer audio visual products market. To respond to these challenges, Sony is striving to keep pace with price erosion by reducing its manufacturing and other costs. It is seeking to maintain the premium pricing it enjoys on many of its end-user products by adding functionality to those products and developing new applications and ways of use that appeal to the consumer. In addition, it is taking steps to increase its competitive edge by developing high value-added semiconductors and other digital key devices in-house. By enhancing the in-house production of key devices, Sony aims to incorporate added-value into these key devices. In the area of semiconductors, in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2006, Sony carried out 150 billion yen and 140 billion yen, respectively, of capital expenditure mainly on system large scale integrations (LSI) and CCDs. These totals also include Sonys investment in semiconductor fabrication equipment built at the 65 nanometer process technology level. Chips that will be manufactured using this equipment will be some of the most highly advanced on the market, and will include system LSI, in particular the Cell microprocessor, for anticipated use in the next generation computer entertainment system, PS3, as well as digital consumer electronics products for the broadband era. Over the last five years, Sony, Sony Computer Entertainment, IBM Corporation (IBM) and Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba) have carried out joint development focused on 90 and 65 nanometer process technology for utilization in the design and manufacturing of the Cell microprocessor. Moreover, in 2006 Sony Corporation, IBM, and Toshiba concluded a new joint development agreement to begin a new 5-year alliance for the research and development of advanced semiconductor technology. In the area of other key devices, S-LCD, Sonys joint venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. based in South Korea, started production of 7th generation amorphous TFT LCD panel (glass panel size: approximately 1,870mm × 2,200mm) in April 2005 and since October 2005 has been producing 60,000 sheets a month. In July 2006, S-LCD increased its production capacity to 75,000 panels a month, and further investment has been committed that will raise its production capacity to 90,000 panels at the start of calendar 2007. The total amount of these new investments, to be self-financed by S-LCD, is approximately 10 billion yen and approximately 28 billion yen, respectively. In July 2006, Sony and Samsung signed the final contract regarding the manufacturing of 8th generation TFT LCD panels (glass panel size: approximately 2,200mm × 2,500mm) at the S-LCD joint venture. The total amount of the investment is expected to be approximately 1.9 billion U.S. dollars (approximately 78 Table of Contents 50 percent of which will be borne by Sony), targeting a production capacity of 50,000 panels a month from fall, 2007. Game In the Game segment, although it is anticipated that the size of the PS2 business, six years into its business cycle after its domestic launch in Japan in March 2000, will begin to contract, SCE will endeavor to maintain a continued high share of the global game console market for both PS2 hardware and software. Furthermore, through the addition of software and hardware system upgrades and new peripherals, which will work in tandem with PSP software to propose new ways of enjoying the handheld, SCE will promote further penetration of the platform. In addition, the new PS3 computer entertainment platform is scheduled to launch in November 2006. Through the provision of an appealing software line-up, SCE will promote the launch of the PS3 platform (See Game in Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2006 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2005 within Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects for more detailed information regarding the impact of the PS3 launch). Pictures In the Pictures segment, Sony faces intense competition, rising advertising and promotion expenses and a growing trend toward digital piracy. In addition, the DVD format is nine years old and is showing signs of maturation. To meet these challenges, Sony is working to distribute a diversified portfolio of motion pictures with broad worldwide appeal on existing and new home entertainment formats, including Blu-ray, and on other emerging platforms, including digital download. Financial Services In the Financial Services segment, the value of assets accumulated by the businesses in the segment has grown continuously over the past several years, resulting in a large portion (approximately 43 percent) of Sonys total assets being accounted for by the Financial Services segment. To strengthen asset management and risk management in parallel with this growing asset value, enhance disclosure of business details, and offer customers integrated financial services tailored to their individual needs, in April 2004 Sony established Sony Financial Holdings Inc., a holding company overseeing Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank, with the aim of both increasing the synergies between these businesses and targeting an initial public offering at some point in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008 or subsequent fiscal year thereafter, as deemed appropriate by Sony after taking into account equity market conditions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Sony evaluates its estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. Sony considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to its financial condition and results, and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. Sony believes that the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company. Investments Sonys investments are comprised of debt and equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity method of accounting. If it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings. Sony 79 Table of Contents regularly evaluates its investment portfolio to identify other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities. Factors that are considered by Sony in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of credit condition of the issuers, sovereign risk, and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities whose fair values are readily determinable, management presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally a period of up to six to twelve months). This criteria is employed as a threshold to identify securities which may have a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of other factors which overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is not more than 20 percent or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors which may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary often requires management judgment based on evaluation of relevant factors. Those factors include business plans and future cash flows of the issuer of the security, the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee, and the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that are currently believed to be temporary may determine to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of additional information such as continued poor operating results, future broad declines in value of worldwide equity markets or circumstances in market interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized into income in future periods. Impairment of long-lived assets Sony reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets held and used and long-lived assets to be disposed of whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. This review is performed using estimates of future cash flows by product category (e.g. CRT TV displays) or entity (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing division in the U.S.). If the carrying value of the asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations of those long-lived assets. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 16.1 billion yen. It included 5.3 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets such as semiconductor and CRT TV display manufacturing equipment to be abandoned or sold in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. It also included 3.0 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets in the Music business such as a certain CD manufacturing facility to be abandoned or sold and a recording studio and equipment to be held and used in Japan. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 19.2 billion yen. It included 7.5 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of CRT TV display manufacturing facilities to be held and used in Europe in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. 80 Table of Contents In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 59.8 billion yen. It included 25.5 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of CRT TV display manufacturing facilities to be held and used in the U.S. in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. The impairment charge also included 8.5 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of the Metreon, an entertainment complex to be held for sale in the U.S. in connection with restructuring activities of non-core businesses in All Other. The impairment charge was based on the negotiated sales price of the complex. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are tested for impairment in accordance with FAS No. 142 during the fourth quarter of fiscal year on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying amount. Such an event would include unfavorable variances from established business plans, significant changes in forecasted results or volatility inherent to external markets and industries, which are periodically reviewed by management. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit (Sonys operating segments or one level below the operating segments) with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Other intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could significantly impact whether or not an impairment charge is recognized as well as the magnitude of any such charge. In its impairment review, Sony performs internal valuation analyses or utilizes third-party valuations when management believes it to be appropriate, and considers other market information that is publicly available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analysis. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. During the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2006, Sony performed the annual impairment test for goodwill and recorded an impairment loss of 0.5 billion yen in a reporting unit in All Other. This impairment charge reflected the overall decline in the fair value of a subsidiary. The fair value of the subsidiary was estimated principally using the expected present value of future cash flows. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations, which may result in Sony recognizing impairment charges 81 Table of Contents for goodwill and other intangible assets in the future. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the impairment analysis, Sony applied a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. As of March 31, 2006, a 10 percent hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting units would not have resulted in a material impairment loss. Pension benefits costs Employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on certain assumptions including discount rates, retirement rates and mortality rates, which are based upon current statistical data, as well as expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and other factors. Specifically, the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets are two critical assumptions in the determination of periodic pension costs and pension liabilities. Assumptions are evaluated at least annually, or at the time when events occur or circumstances change and these events or changes could have a significant effect on these critical assumptions. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. Therefore, actual results generally affect recognized costs and the recorded obligations for pensions in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys pension obligations and future costs. Sonys principal pension plans are its Japanese pension plans. Foreign pension plans are not significant individually with total assets and pension obligations amounting to less than 10 percent of those of the aggregate of the Japanese pension plans. To determine the benefit obligation of the Japanese pension plans, Sony used a discount rate of 2.2 percent for its Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2006. The discount rate was determined by using currently available information about rates of return on high-quality fixed-income investments available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit obligation in consideration of amounts and timing of cash outflows for expected benefit payments. Such available information about rates of returns is collected from Bloomberg and credit rating agencies. The 2.2 percent discount rate represents a 10 basis point decrease from the 2.3 percent discount rate used for fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. The reduction of the average duration of benefit payments in consideration of amounts and timing of cash outflows for expected benefit payments is mainly due to the fact that more retiring employees selected lump-sum amounts instead of monthly pension payments. For Japanese pension plans, a 10 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension costs by approximately 0.8 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, Sony considers the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on various categories of plan assets. For Japanese pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 3.2 percent and 3.5 percent as of March 31, 2005 and 2006 respectively. The actual gain on pension plan assets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was 10.6 percent. Actual results that differ from the expected return on plan assets are accumulated and amortized as a component of pension costs over the average future service period, thereby reducing the year-to-year volatility in pension costs. As of March 31, 2005 and 2006, Sony had unrecognized actuarial losses of 322.2 billion yen and 169.9 billion yen, respectively, including losses related to plan assets. As a result of the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion, unrecognized actuarial losses related to the substitutional portion was recognized as a settlement loss. Therefore unrecognized actuarial losses were reduced. The unrecognized actuarial losses reflect the overall unfavorable return on investment over the past several years and will result in an increase in pension costs as they are recognized. Sony recorded a liability for the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for Japanese pension plans of 128.6 billion yen and 35.8 billion yen as of March 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. This liability represents the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation under Sonys qualified defined benefit pension plans over the fair value of the plans assets. This liability was established by a charge to stockholders equity, resulting in no impact to the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 82 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate and the expected return on pension plan assets, while holding all other assumptions constant, for Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2006. As benefit obligation and plan assets decreased due to the transfer to the government of the substitutional portion, the sensitivity also decreased. Pre-Tax Pension Equity Change in Assumption PBO Costs (Net of Tax) (Yen in billions) 25 basis point increase/decrease in discount rate -/+24.7 -/+2.0 +/-1.2 25 basis point increase/decrease in expected return on assets  -/+1.2 +/-0.7 Deferred tax asset valuation Sony records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In establishing the appropriate valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (including deferred tax assets on tax loss carry-forwards), all available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered. Information on historical results is supplemented by all currently available information on future years, because realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on whether each tax-filing unit generates sufficient taxable income. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in Sonys approved forecasts of future operations. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets, less valuation allowance, will be realized. Film accounting An aspect of film accounting that requires the exercise of judgment relates to the process of estimating the total revenues to be received throughout a films life cycle. Such estimate of a films ultimate revenue is important for two reasons. First, while a film is being produced and the related costs are being capitalized, it is necessary for management to estimate the ultimate revenue, less additional costs to be incurred, including exploitation costs which are expensed as incurred, in order to determine whether the value of a film has been impaired and thus requires an immediate write off of unrecoverable film costs. Second, the amount of film costs recognized as cost of sales for a given film as it is exhibited in various markets throughout its life cycle is based upon the proportion that current period actual revenues bear to the estimated ultimate total revenues. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on several factors including the historical performance of similar genre films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses, the expected number of theaters at which the film will be released, anticipated performance in the home entertainment, television and other ancillary markets, and agreements for future sales. Management updates such estimates based on the actual results to date of each film. For example, a film that has resulted in lower than expected theatrical revenues in its initial weeks of release would generally have its theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution ultimate revenues adjusted downward; a failure to do so would result in the understatement of amortized film costs for the period. Since the total film cost to be amortized for a given film is fixed, the estimate of ultimate revenues impacts only the timing of film cost amortization. Future insurance policy benefits Liabilities for future insurance policy benefits are established in amounts adequate to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force. These liabilities are computed by the net level premium method based upon estimates as to future investment yield, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals and other factors. Future policy benefits are computed using interest rates ranging from approximately 0.90 percent to 5.10 percent. Mortality, morbidity and withdrawal assumptions for all policies are based on either the life insurance subsidiarys own experience or various actuarial tables. Generally these assumptions are locked-in upon the issuance of new insurance. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys future insurance policy benefits. 83 Table of Contents RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts In July 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP) 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts. SOP 03-1 requires insurance enterprises to record additional reserves for long-duration life insurance contracts with minimum guarantee or annuity receivable options. Additionally, SOP 03-1 provides guidance for the presentation of separate accounts. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2003. Sony adopted SOP 03-1 on April 1, 2004. As a result of the adoption of SOP 03-1, Sonys operating income decreased by 5.2 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Additionally, on April 1, 2004, Sony recorded a 4.7 billion yen charge (net of income taxes of 2.7 billion yen) as a cumulative effect of an accounting change. The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share In July 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 128, Earnings per Share, Sony had not previously included in the computation of diluted earnings per share (EPS) the number of potential common stock issuable upon the conversion of contingently convertible debt instruments (Co-Cos) that had not met the conditions to exercise the stock acquisition rights. EITF Issue No. 04-8 requires that the maximum number of common stock that could be issued upon the conversion of Co-Cos be included in diluted EPS computations from the date of issuance regardless of whether the conditions to exercise the stock acquisition rights have been met. EITF Issue No. 04-8 is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. Sony adopted EITF Issue No. 04-8 during the quarter ended December 31, 2004. As a result of the adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-8, Sonys diluted EPS of income before cumulative effect of an accounting change and net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 were restated. Sonys diluted EPS of income before cumulative effect of an accounting change and net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased by 7.26 yen and 7.06 yen, respectively, as a result of adopting EITF Issue No. 04-8. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51. FIN No. 46 addresses consolidation by a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). Sony early adopted the provisions of FIN No. 46 on July 1, 2003. As a result of adopting the original FIN No. 46, Sony recognized a one-time charge with no tax effect of 2.1 billion yen as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of income, and Sonys assets and liabilities increased by 95.3 billion yen and 98.0 billion yen, respectively. These increases were treated as non-cash transactions in the consolidated statement of cash flows. In addition, cash and cash equivalents increased by 1.5 billion yen. Sony subsequently early adopted the provisions of FIN No. 46 R, which replaced FIN No. 46, upon issuance in December 2003. The adoption of FIN No. 46R did not have an impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position or impact the way Sony had previously accounted for VIEs. Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of Accounting Principle Board Opinion (APB) No. 29. This statement requires that exchanges of productive assets be accounted for at fair value unless fair value cannot be reasonably determined or the transaction lacks commercial substance. This statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges that have occurred in the fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Sony adopted FAS No. 153 on July 1, 2005. The adoption of FAS No. 153 did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. 84 Table of Contents Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations  an Interpretation of FAS No. 143. FIN No. 47 clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. Sony adopted FIN No. 47 on March 31, 2006. The adoption of FIN No. 47 did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds In September 2004, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 04-10, Applying Paragraph 19 of FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, in Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds. EITF Issue No. 04-10 clarifies how an enterprise should evaluate the aggregation criteria in paragraph 17 of FAS No. 131 when determining whether operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds may be aggregated in accordance with paragraph 19 of FAS No. 131. EITF Issue No. 04-10 is effective for fiscal years ending after September 15, 2005. Sony adopted EITF Issue No. 04-10 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-10 did not have an impact on Sonys results of operation and financial position. RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (FAS No. 123(R)). This statement requires the use of the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation and eliminates the alternative use of the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB No. 25. With limited exceptions, FAS No. 123(R) requires that the grant-date fair value of share-based payments to employees be expensed over the period the service is received. Sony has accounted for its employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions prescribed by APB No. 25 and its related interpretations and has disclosed the net effect on net income and net income per share allocated to the common stock if Sony had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation as described in Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (2) Significant accounting policies  Stock-based compensation. Sony adopted FAS No. 123(R) on April 1, 2006. Sony has elected the modified prospective method of transition prescribed in FAS No. 123(R), which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock acquisition rights as the requisite service is rendered beginning with the first period of adoption. As of March 31, 2006, the aggregate value of the unvested stock acquisition rights was 4.4 billion yen. Sony expects the total expenses to be recorded in the future periods will be consistent with the pro forma information shown in Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (2) Significant accounting policies  Stock-based compensation. Inventory Costs In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement requires certain abnormal expenditures to be recognized as expenses in the current period. It also requires that the amount of fixed production overhead allocated to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This statement shall be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with early adoption during the fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued encouraged. The adoption of FAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. 85 Table of Contents Derivative instruments and hedging activities In February 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FAS No. 133 and FAS No. 140. This statement permits an entity to elect fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument (with changes in fair value recognized in earnings) if the hybrid instrument contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately under FAS No. 133. The election to measure the hybrid instrument at fair value is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irreversible. The statement will be effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entitys fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted as of the beginning of fiscal year, provided that financial statements for any interim period of that fiscal year have not been issued. The adoption of FAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets In March 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. This statement amends FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. This statement shall be effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new pronouncement. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Early application of the provisions of this Interpretation is encouraged if financial statements have not been issued, including interim financial statements, in the period this Interpretation is adopted. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this Interpretation. Item 6.

There is no family relationship between any of the persons named above. There is no arrangement or understanding with major shareholders, customers, suppliers, or others pursuant to which any person named above was selected as a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer. Compensation The aggregate amount of remuneration, including bonuses paid and benefits in kind granted by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 to all Directors and Corporate Executive Officers (refer to Board Practices below) of Sony Corporation who served during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, as a group (29 people), totaled 2,666 million yen. Also, as a part of Sonys incentive compensation arrangements, Sony Corporation issued stock acquisition rights during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. The stock acquisition rights, which represent rights to subscribe for shares of common stock of Sony Corporation, have been granted to the Directors, Corporate Executive Officers, Corporate Executives, Group Executives, and selected employees. The stock acquisition rights generally vest ratably up to three years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. The portion of those stock acquisition rights which was granted by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 to the Directors and Corporate Executive Officers confers rights to purchase a total number of 605,200 shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock. The exercise price for these yen-denominated stock acquisition rights issued as of November 17, 2005 was 93 Table of Contents 4,060 yen per share, and the exercise price for these U.S. dollar-denominated stock acquisition rights issued as of November 17, 2005 was 34.14 U.S. dollars. Regarding the above compensation plans, refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the retirement allowance scheme was terminated and a new stock-based retirement remuneration (phantom restricted stock plan) was introduced. With the introduction of this plan, there was no amount accrued for lump-sum severance indemnities by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 for Directors and Corporate Executive Officers of Sony Corporation as of March 31, 2006, as a group (14 people). Under this new plan, points fixed every year by the Compensation Committee shall be granted to Directors and Corporate Executive Officers every year during his/her tenure in office, and at the time of resignation, the remuneration amount shall be calculated by multiplying Sonys common stock price by accumulated points. The resigning Directors and Corporate Executive Officers shall purchase Sonys common stock with this remuneration. The aggregate number of points granted to Directors and Corporate Executive Officers of Sony Corporation as of March 31, 2006, as a group (14 people) totaled 27,900 points. Board Practices Sony has adopted a Company with Committees corporate governance system under the Japanese Company Law (Kaishaho) and related legislation (collectively the Company Law). Under this system, Sony Corporation has three committees: the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Under the Company Law, each committee is required to consist of not less than three Directors, the majority of whom must be outside Directors. Under the committee system, Directors as such have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except for limited circumstances as permitted by law. The Board of Directors must elect Corporate Executive Officers (Shikko-yaku), who are responsible for the execution of the business of Sony Corporation. A summary of the governance system adopted by Sony Corporation is set forth below. The Board of Directors determines fundamental management policy and other important matters related to the management of Sony and oversees the performance of the duties of Directors and Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Company Law, all Directors must be elected at the General Meeting of Shareholders from the candidates determined by the Nominating Committee. Under the Company Law, the terms of office of Directors expire at the conclusion of the General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. Directors may serve any number of consecutive terms although, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, outside Directors may not be reelected more than five times without the consent of all Directors. The Nominating Committee, which pursuant to the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation consists of five or more Directors, determines the content of proposals to be submitted for approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the appointment and dismissal of Directors. As stated above, under the Company Law, a majority of the members of the Nominating Committee must be outside Directors. In order to qualify as an outside Director under the Company Law, a Director must be a person (i) who is not a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) who has never been a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, two or more members of the Nominating Committee must concurrently be Corporate Executive Officers. The Nominating Committee is composed of the following members as of July 31, 2006: Yotaro Kobayashi, who is the Chairman of the Nominating Committee and an outside Director; Hirobumi Kawano and Peter Bonfield who are outside Directors; and Howard Stringer and Ryoji Chubachi, who are Corporate Executive Officers. 94 Table of Contents Under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, the Audit Committee must consist of three or more Directors, a majority of whom, as stated above, must be outside Directors. In addition, under the Company Law, a member of the Audit Committee may not concurrently be a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries who is engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or an accounting counselor, general manager or other employee of any of such subsidiaries. Further, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, members of the Audit Committee must meet the independence and other equivalent requirements of U.S. securities laws and regulations to the extent applicable to Sony Corporation. The Audit Committees primary responsibility is to audit the consolidated and non-consolidated financial statements and business reports to be submitted by the Board of Directors at the General Meeting of Shareholders; to audit the performance of duties by Directors and Corporate Executive Officers (with regard to preparation process of financial statements, disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls, compliance structure, risk management structure, internal audit structure, internal hotline system and other matters), in each case pursuant to the Company Law; and to propose appointment/dismissal or non-reappointment of, approve the compensation of, and oversee and evaluate the work of Sonys independent auditors. Under the Company Law, the Audit Committee has a statutory duty to prepare and submit its audit report to the Corporate Executive Officer designated by the Board of Directors each year. A member of the Audit Committee may note his or her opinion in the audit report if it is different from the opinion of the Audit Committee that is expressed in the audit report. The Audit Committee discusses with Sony Corporations independent auditor, ChuoAoyama PricewaterhouseCoopers, the scope and results of audits by the independent auditor including their evaluation of Sony Corporations internal controls, compatibility with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S., and the overall quality of financial reporting. The Audit Committee makes an assessment of the independence of ChuoAoyama PricewaterhouseCoopers by overseeing their activities through regular communications and discussions with ChuoAoyama PricewaterhouseCoopers, and shall pre-approve audit and non-audit services to be provided. The Audit Committee is composed of the following members as of July 31, 2006: Yoshiaki Yamauchi, who is the Chairman of the Audit Committee and an outside Director; and Sakie T. Fukushima and Fueo Sumita, who are also outside Directors. Both Yoshiaki Yamauchi and Fueo Sumita are audit committee financial experts within the meaning of Item 16A of this report. As required by the Company Law, the Compensation Committee determines the compensation, bonus and any other benefits (including equity-related rights or options given for the purpose of stock incentive options) to be received by each Director and Corporate Executive Officer in consideration of the execution of their duties. In addition to such statutory duties, the Compensation Committee sets policy on the composition of individual compensation to be received by other senior management of Sony Group (Directors or other officers of Sony Group companies whose appointment is subject to approval by the CEO of Sony Corporation), and also submits proposals to the Board of Directors regarding the issuance of stock acquisition rights for the purpose of granting stock options and other forms of stock price-based compensation utilizing shares etc. of Sony Group, as individual compensation to the aforementioned senior management. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee shall consist of three or more Directors, and as a general rule, at least one member shall concurrently serve as Corporate Executive Officer; provided, however, that a Director who is the CEO (Chief Executive Officer), or the COO (Chief Operating Officer) of Sony Group or in any equivalent position shall not be a member of the Compensation Committee. As stated above, a majority of the members of the Compensation Committee must be outside Directors. The Compensation Committee is composed of the following members as of July 31, 2006: Akishige Okada, who is the Chairman of the Compensation Committee and an outside Director; and Yoshihiko Miyauchi and Fujio Cho, who are also outside Directors, and Göran Lindahl, who was a Corporate Executive Officer of Sony Group. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the Board of Directors met 8 times. The Nominating Committee met 5 times, the Audit Committee 11 times and the Compensation Committee 7 times. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, each incumbent Director attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate 95 Table of Contents number of meetings of the Board and Committees on which he/she served (during the period that he/she served). No Directors have service contracts with Sony providing for benefits upon termination of service as a Director. Under the Company Law and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may, by a resolution of the Board of Directors, exempt Directors from liabilities to Sony Corporation to the extent permitted by law arising in connection with their failure to execute their duties. Accordingly, Sony Corporation has entered into a liability limitation agreement with each outside Director that limits the maximum amount of their liabilities owed to Sony Corporation arising in connection with their failure to execute their duties to the greater of either 30 million yen or an amount equal to the aggregate sum of the amounts prescribed in each item of Article 425, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law. The Board of Directors must appoint one or more Corporate Executive Officers who are authorized to determine matters delegated to them by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Executive Officers are responsible for conducting all the business operations of Sony within the scope of authority delegated by the Board of Directors. As of July 31, 2006, there are 7 Corporate Executive Officers, some of whom are also Directors. Significant decision-making authority has been delegated to the CEO and also to each Corporate Executive Officer with regard to investments, strategic alliances and other actions related to the execution of business operations. Sony Corporation believes that this significant delegation enables Sony to be managed in a more dynamic and responsive manner. The terms of office of Corporate Executive Officers must expire at the conclusion of the first meeting of the Board of Directors held immediately after the conclusion of the General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. From among the Corporate Executive Officers who as a general rule are also Directors, the Board of Directors shall elect Representative Corporate Executive Officers. Each Representative Corporate Executive Officer has the statutory authority to represent Sony Corporation in the conduct of its affairs. (Reference) At a Board meeting held on April 26, 2006, the Board of Directors reaffirmed the existing internal control and governance framework and determined to continue to evaluate and improve such framework going forward, as appropriate.
