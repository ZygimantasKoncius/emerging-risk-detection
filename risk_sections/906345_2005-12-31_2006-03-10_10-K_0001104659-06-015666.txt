Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations. 4 Rising interest rates would increase our costs and could affect the market price of our common shares. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur debt in the future. Some of this debt has variable or floating interest rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, our interest costs will also increase. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common shares to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding common shares. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt service and pay distributions to shareholders and could adversely affect our ability to maintain our status as a REIT. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the cash flows generated by our properties:  the national and local economic climates;  local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes;  the perceptions by prospective residents of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located;  the need to periodically repair, renovate and relet space; and  our ability to pay for adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs, including real estate taxes. Some significant expenditures associated with each property, such as mortgage payments, if any, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when cash flows from operations from the property decrease. Unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could hurt occupancy or rental rates. The market and economic conditions may significantly affect apartment home occupancy or rental rates. Occupancy and rental rates in the markets in which we operate, in turn, may significantly affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and make distributions to security holders. The risks that may affect conditions in these markets include the following:  the economic climate, which may be adversely impacted by plant closings, industry slowdowns and other factors;  local conditions, such as oversupply of apartments or a reduction in demand for apartments in an area;  a future economic downturn that simultaneously affects more than one of our geographical markets;  the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay their current rent or rent increases;  the potential effect of rent control or rent stabilization laws, or other laws regulating housing, which could prevent us from raising rents; and  competition from other available apartments and changes in market rental rates. Difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility. Real estate investments can be hard to sell, especially if market conditions are poor. This may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, the Internal 5 Revenue Code limits our ability to sell properties that we have held for fewer than four years, which may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting our return. Development and construction risks could impact our profitability. We intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our own account. Our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks that may increase our construction costs. This factor could adversely impact our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and make distributions to security holders. These risks include the following:  we may be unable to obtain, or may face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs;  we may incur construction costs for a property that exceed our original estimates due to increased materials, labor or other costs, or due to errors and omissions that occur in the design or construction process, and we may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increases in these costs;  occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in the community not being profitable;  we may not be able to obtain financing with favorable terms for the development of a community, which may make us unable to proceed with its development;  we may not be able to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, which could result in increased costs;  we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore and, as a result, may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring these development opportunities; and  we rely on subcontractors to perform most of our construction activities and poor performance or defaults by a major subcontractor, or our inability to obtain adequate performance bonds for a major subcontractor, may lead to project delays and unanticipated additional costs. We also develop and construct properties for unrelated third parties pursuant to guaranteed maximum price contracts. The terms of these contracts require us to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and we assume the risk that the time and costs associated with our performance may be greater than is anticipated. As a result, our profitability on guaranteed maximum price contracts is dependent on our ability to predict these factors accurately. The time and costs may be affected by a variety of factors, including those listed above, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the terms of these contracts generally require a warranty period, which may be up to ten years long, during which we may be required to repair, replace or rebuild a project in the event of a material defect in the structure of the project. If we do not accurately predict the time and costs of guaranteed maximum price contracts for particular projects, or if the costs of the warranty work exceed the amounts reserved for these matters, we could suffer losses on those projects and our profitability could be less than anticipated. 6 Failure to implement our property acquisition strategy could impact our profitability. In the normal course of our business, we continually evaluate a number of potential acquisitions and may acquire additional operating properties. Our inability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy could result in our market penetration decreasing, which could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and make distributions to shareholders. Our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to a number of risks, including the following:  we may not be able to identify properties to acquire or effect the acquisition;  we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations;  our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate; and  the acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding debt of approximately $2.6 billion. This indebtedness could have important consequences. For example:  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the mortgage;  if cash flow from operations is less than the required principal and interest payments on our existing indebtedness, which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity, we might not be able to refinance the debt or the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness;  our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions could be increased; and  our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry could be limited. Issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties, dividend payment rates to our shareholders, development and capital expenditures, costs of operations and potential acquisitions. We cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements. If our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. Accordingly, we could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future. Losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage. We carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our properties, which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets. We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future. However, some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, may be subject to limitations. We exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. 7 Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we are liable for the costs to investigate and remove or remediate hazardous or toxic substances on or in our properties, often regardless of whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of these substances. These costs may be substantial. Also, if hazardous or toxic substances are present on a property, or if we fail to properly remediate such substances, our ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow using that property as collateral may be adversely affected. Additionally, we occasionally develop, manage, lease and/or operate various properties for third parties. Consequently, we may be considered to have been or to be an operator of these properties and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs that could relate to hazardous or toxic substances. Over the past several years, there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. Compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost. The Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, or FHAA, and other federal, state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. These laws may require us to modify our existing properties. These laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs. Legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons. Although we believe our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements, we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with the ADA, FHAA and other federal, state and local laws. Failure to qualify as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly lower funds available for distribution to shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will be taxed as a corporation. The Internal Revenue Service may challenge our qualification as a REIT for prior years, and new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the federal tax consequences of such qualification. For any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates, plus any applicable alternative minimum tax. In addition, unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost. This treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved. In addition, distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve REIT status. We might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a REIT. Share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders. For us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals. As defined for federal income tax purposes, the term individuals includes a number of specified entities. To minimize the possibility that we will fail to qualify as a 8 REIT under this test, our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits. The ownership limits, as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities, may delay, defer or prevent a change in control. These provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares that may be attractive to you, or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares that might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction. We make mezzanine loans that involve risk of loss. We have made and may continue to make mezzanine loans to various third parties, which are typically secured by multifamily residential real estate and are subordinate to senior mortgages. While these loans are outstanding, we are subject to risks of borrower defaults, bankruptcies, fraud and other losses. In the event of any default under mezzanine loans held by us, we will bear the risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the loan collateral and the principal amount of the loan. In addition, mezzanine loans involve a higher degree of risk that we may not recover some or all of our investment than senior mortgages due to a variety of factors, including the loan becoming unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. Increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rents. Our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent or sale. Competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartments and increase or maintain rents. Attractive investment opportunities may not be available, which could adversely affect our profitability. We expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. These competitors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, partnerships, investment companies and other apartment REITs, may have greater resources than we do. This competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue. As a result, we may not be able, or have the opportunity, to make suitable investments on favorable terms in the future. This could adversely affect our profitability. We depend on our key personnel. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us. Changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business. We are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate taxes, income taxes or other taxes. Consequently, any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and make distributions to security holders. Changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance could have the same impact. As a large publicly traded owner of multifamily properties, we may become involved in legal proceedings, including consumer, employment, tort or commercial litigation, that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability that is material to our financial condition or results of operations. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. 9 Item 2. Properties The Properties Our properties typically consist of mid-rise buildings and two- and three-story buildings in a landscaped setting and provide residents with a variety of amenities. Most of the properties have one or more swimming pools and a clubhouse and many have whirlpool spas, tennis courts and controlled-access gates. Many of the apartment homes offer additional features such as fireplaces, vaulted ceilings, microwave ovens, covered parking, icemakers, washers and dryers and ceiling fans. Operating Properties The 191 operating properties, which we owned interests in and operated at December 31, 2005, averaged 899 square feet of living area per apartment home. For the year ended December 31, 2005, no single operating property accounted for greater than 2.0% of our total revenues. The operating properties had a weighted average occupancy rate of 95.0% and 94.0% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Resident lease terms generally range from six to thirteen months and usually require security deposits. One hundred and sixty-four of our operating properties have over 200 apartment homes, with the largest having 894 apartment homes. Our operating properties have an average age of 10 years (calculated on the basis of investment dollars). Our operating properties were constructed and placed in service as follows: Year Placed in Service Number of Operating Properties 2000-2005 41 1995-1999 52 1990-1994 21 1985-1989 41 1980-1984 25 Prior to 1980 11 Property Table The following table sets forth information with respect to our operating properties at December 31, 2005. 10 OPERATING PROPERTIES December 2005 Average Monthly Rental Rates Property and Location Number of Apartments Year Placed In Service Average Apartment Size (Sq.

Development Property The total budgeted cost of the wholly-owned development properties is approximately $491.0 million, with a remaining cost to complete, as of December 31, 2005, of approximately $212.5 million. There can be no assurance that our budget, leasing or occupancy estimates will be attained for the development properties or their performance will be comparable to that of our existing portfolio. Development Property Table The development property table is incorporated herein by reference from page 55 of our Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2005, which is filed as Exhibit 13.1. Management believes that we possess the development capabilities and experience to provide a continuing source of portfolio growth. In making development decisions, management considers a number of factors, including the size of the property, projected market rents and expenses, projected local area job growth, cost of single family housing in the area and availability of land for competing development properties. In order to pursue a development opportunity, we currently require a minimum initial stabilized target return of 6% to 10%. This minimum target return is based on projected market rents and projected stabilized expenses, considering the market and the nature of the prospective development. Item 3.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2005. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005. There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as follows: A process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of trust managers, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 16  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management concluded our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2005. Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. Deloitte & Touche LLPs attestation report regarding the effectiveness of managements assessment of internal controls over financial reporting is included herein. 17 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Trust Managers and the Shareholders of Camden Property Trust We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Camden Property Trust and subsidiaries (the Trust) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Trusts management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 of the Trust and our reports dated March 8, 2006 expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements and financial statement schedules. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Houston, Texas March 8, 2006 18 Item 9B.

Historical results and trends which might appear should not be interpreted as being indicative of future operations. We have made statements in this report which are forward-looking in that they do not discuss historical fact, but instead note expectations, projections, intentions or other items relating to the future. Reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements as they are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other facts that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements. Many of these factors are noted in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in the text. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ include:  the results of our efforts to implement our property development and acquisition strategies;  the effects of economic conditions, including rising interest rates;  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows;  the failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust;  the costs of our capital and debt;  changes in our capital requirements;  the actions of our competitors and our ability to respond to those actions;  the actions of borrowers under our mezzanine loans;  changes in governmental regulations, tax rates and similar matters; and  environmental uncertainties and disasters. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. Business Camden Property Trust is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and, with our subsidiaries, reports as a single business segment with activities related to the ownership, development, construction and management of multifamily apartment communities. Our use of the term communities, multifamily communities, properties, or multifamily properties in the following discussion refers to our multifamily apartment communities. As of December 31, 2005, we owned interests in, operated or were developing 200 multifamily properties containing 68,791 apartment homes located in thirteen states. We had 3,211 apartment homes under development at nine of our multifamily properties, including 464 apartment homes at one multifamily property owned through a joint venture. We had seven properties containing 2,956 apartment homes which were designated as held for sale. Additionally, we had several sites that we intend to develop into multifamily apartment communities. At the end of 2004, we believed we were well positioned both geographically and financially to take advantage of opportunities as they became available. During the first quarter of 2005, we took advantage of one such opportunity by completing our merger with Summit Properties Inc. (Summit). One of our key operating strategies has always been market balance. Through our merger with Summit, which is discussed below, and development and disposition activities which occurred throughout 2005, we have increased our market presence in key markets, such as Southern California, Washington, D.C. Metro, Atlanta and Southeast Florida, decreased our relative concentration in Houston, Dallas and Las Vegas, and expanded our development pipeline. As a result of the transactions completed in 2005, we have a portfolio of newer, higher-quality communities in 22 markets, with no single market contributing more than 10% of our net operating income. During 2006, we intend to continue our strategy of selectively disposing of properties and redeploying capital if it is determined that a property cannot meet our long term growth requirements. We believe that recycling capital is an important aspect of maintaining the overall quality of our portfolio. Our 2005 operating results reflected a continuation of earnings growth fueled by solid job growth and shifts in rental demand and pricing that favored multifamily owners. We achieved increases in revenues in 19 of our 22 markets during 2005. During 2005, we completed the roll out of our web based property management and revenue management systems. These two systems should improve onsite efficiency and allow us to take full advantage of the economic recovery that appears to be underway by achieving market driven rental rates. Our fourth quarter 2005 weighted average occupancy was 96.1%, and while we expect that average to normalize at the 95% range, any decreases in occupancy should be offset by higher rental rates. As in prior years, expense growth continued to be a challenge, as increases in property expenses were driven by increases in property taxes, utility costs and normal increases in employee related expenses. We intend to continue to focus on controlling expenses during 2006. Merger with Summit Properties Inc. On February 28, 2005, Summit was merged with and into Camden Summit Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (Camden Summit), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 4, 2004 (the Merger Agreement), as amended. Prior to the effective time of the merger, Summit was the sole general partner of Summit Properties Partnership, L.P. (the Camden Summit Partnership). At the effective time, Camden Summit became the sole general partner of the Camden Summit Partnership and the name of such partnership was changed to Camden Summit Partnership, L.P. As of February 28, 2005, Summit owned or held an ownership interest in 48 operating communities comprised of 15,002 apartment homes with an additional 1,834 apartment homes under construction in five new communities. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Summit stockholders had the opportunity to elect to receive cash or Camden shares for their Summit stock. Each stockholders election was subject to proration, depending on the elections of all Summit stockholders, so that the aggregate amount of cash issued in the merger to Summits stockholders equaled approximately $436.3 million. As a result of this proration, Summit stockholders electing Camden shares received approximately .6383 of a Camden share and $1.4177 in cash for each of their shares of Summit common stock. The final conversion ratio of the common shares was determined based on the average market price of our common shares over a five day trading period preceding the effective time of the merger. Fractional shares were paid in cash. Summit stockholders electing cash or who made no effective election received $31.20 in cash for each of their Summit shares. In the merger, we issued approximately 11.8 million common shares to Summit stockholders. In conjunction with the merger, the limited partners in the Camden Summit Partnership were offered, on a unit-by-unit basis, the opportunity to redeem their partnership units for $31.20 in cash, without interest, or to remain in the Camden Summit Partnership following the merger at a unit valuation equal to .6687 of a Camden common share. The limited partner elections resulted in the redemption of 0.7 million partnership units for cash, for an aggregate of $21.7 million, and the issuance of 1.8 million partnership units. The value of the common shares and partnership units issued was determined based on the average market price of our common shares for the five day period commencing two days prior to the announcement of the merger on October 4, 2004. Subsequent to the merger, 0.1 million partnership units have been redeemed for $5.7 million. Property Update As of December 31, 2005, we had operating properties in 22 markets. No single market contributed more than 10% of our net operating income for 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Washington, D.C. Metro, Dallas and Tampa contributed 9.9%, 8.2% and 8.2%, respectively, to our net operating income. Net operating income represents total property revenues less total property expenses. We continually evaluate our portfolio to ensure appropriate geographic diversification in order to manage our risk of market concentration. We seek to selectively dispose of assets which management believes are highly capital intensive, have a lower projected growth rate than the overall portfolio, or no longer conform to our operating and investment strategies.

Each property is held in an individual joint venture in which we hold a 20% interest. The remaining interest is owned by an unaffiliated private investor. Stabilized Communities We consider a property stabilized once it reaches 90% occupancy, or generally one year from opening the leasing office, with some allowances for larger than average properties. During 2005, stabilization was achieved at three recently completed communities totaling 1,054 apartment homes as follows: Property and Location Number of Apartment Homes Date of Completion Date of Stabilization Summit Fallsgrove Rockville, MD 268 3Q04 2Q05 Summit Las Olas Ft.

In October 2005, we acquired Camden Gaines Ranch, a 390 apartment home community located in Austin, Texas, for $43.0 million. The intangible assets acquired at acquisition include in-place leases of $0.9 million and below market leases of $43,000. We used proceeds from our unsecured line of credit facility to fund these purchases. Discontinued Operations The results of operations for properties sold during the period or classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2005 are required to be classified as discontinued operations. The property-specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include net operating income, depreciation expense and property specific interest expense. The gain or loss on the eventual disposal of the held for sale properties is also required to be classified as discontinued operations. A summary of our 2005 dispositions and properties held for sale as of December 31, 2005 is as follows: ($ in millions) Property and Location Number of Apartment Homes Date of Disposition Year Built Net Book Value (1) Sold Camden Ybor City Tampa, FL 454 2Q05 2002 Camden Greens Las Vegas, NV 432 1Q05 1990 Summit Lenox Atlanta, GA 431 3Q05 1965 Held for Sale Camden Live Oaks Tampa, FL 770 n/a 1990 $ 38.8 Camden Wilshire Houston, TX 536 n/a 1982 11.0 Camden Pass Tucson, AZ 456 n/a 1984 8.5 Summit Brickell Miami, FL 405 n/a 2003 70.1 Camden View Tucson, AZ 365 n/a 1974 7.7 Camden Trails Dallas, TX 264 n/a 1984 5.0 Camden Highlands Plano, TX 160 n/a 1985 5.1 Total apartment homes sold and held for sale 4,273 (1) Net Book Value is land and buildings and improvements less the related accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had several undeveloped land parcels classified as held for sale as follows: ($ in millions) Location Acres Net Book Value Dallas 7.0 $ 8.2 Southeast Florida 3.1 8.1 Los Angeles/Orange County, CA 2.1 9.6 Total land held for sale $ 25.9 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows and costs to sell, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. During 2005, we sold a 2.0 acre parcel of undeveloped land to an unrelated third party. In connection with our decision to sell this undeveloped land, we recognized an impairment loss of $0.3 million. We also sold four parcels of undeveloped land totaling an aggregate of 17.8 acres to unrelated third parties. In connection with these sales, we received net proceeds of $7.8 million and recognized gains totaling $0.9 million. During 2004, in connection with our decision to dispose of a 2.4 acre parcel of undeveloped land located in Dallas, we incurred an impairment charge of $1.1 million to write-down the carrying value of the land to its fair value, less costs to sell. Development and Lease-Up Properties At December 31, 2005, we had one recently completed property in lease-up as follows: ($ in millions) Property and Location Number of Apartment Homes Cost to Date % Leased at 2/12/06 Date of Completion Estimated Date of Stabilization Camden Farmers Market II Dallas, TX 284 $ 29.4 71 % 3Q05 2Q06 At December 31, 2005, we had nine properties in various stages of construction as follows: ($ in millions) Property and Location Number of Apartment Homes Estimated Cost Cost Incurred Included in Properties Under Development Estimated Date of Completion Estimated Date of Stabilization In Lease-Up Camden Fairfax Corner Fairfax, VA 488 $ 82.0 $ 71.1 $ 54.0 4Q06 2Q07 Camden Manor Park Raleigh, NC 484 52.0 41.0 28.9 4Q06 3Q07 Under Construction Camden Dilworth Charlotte, NC 145 18.0 14.1 14.1 2Q06 4Q06 Camden Clearbrook Frederick, MD 297 45.0 23.9 23.9 4Q06 3Q07 Camden Royal Oaks Houston, TX 236 22.0 8.0 8.0 3Q06 3Q07 Camden Old Creek San Marcos, CA 350 98.0 57.9 57.9 2Q07 4Q07 Camden Monument Place Fairfax, VA 368 64.0 26.3 26.3 2Q07 1Q08 Camden Potomac Yards Arlington, VA 379 110.0 28.7 28.7 3Q07 2Q08 Total 2,747 $ 491.0 $ 271.00 $ 241.8 In Lease-Up  Joint Venture Camden Westwind Ashburn, VA 464 $ 69.1 $ 66.8 $ 29.7 2Q06 2Q07 Real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges. Carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development. Expenditures directly related to the development, acquisition and improvement of real estate assets, excluding internal costs relating to acquisitions of operating properties, are capitalized at cost as land, buildings and improvements. Indirect development costs, including salaries and benefits and other related costs which are clearly attributable to the development of properties, are also capitalized. All construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the balance sheet in properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed. Upon substantial completion of the apartment homes, the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land, respectively, and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation. Where possible, we stage our construction to allow leasing and occupancy during the construction period, which we believe minimizes the duration of the lease-up period following completion of construction. Our accounting policy related to properties in the development and leasing phase is that all operating expenses associated with completed apartment homes are expensed. Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 included $373.0 million related to wholly-owned properties under development. Of this amount, $241.8 million related to our eight projects currently under development. Additionally, at December 31, 2005, we had $131.2 million invested in land held for future development. Included in this amount is $96.2 million related to projects we expect to begin constructing in early to mid 2006. We also had $18.1 million invested in land tracts adjacent to development projects, which are being utilized in conjunction with those projects. Upon completion of these development projects, we expect to utilize this land to further develop apartment homes in these areas. We may also sell certain parcels of these undeveloped land tracts to third parties for commercial and retail development. Geographic Diversification At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our investments in various geographic areas, excluding investments in joint ventures, were as follows: (in thousands) 2005 2004 Washington, D.C. Metro $ 810,717 16.7 % $ 32,976 1.1 % Dallas, Texas 387,159 8.0 425,806 13.8 Southeast Florida 371,579 7.6   Los Angeles/Orange County, California 342,279 7.0 387,227 12.5 Charlotte, North Carolina 334,063 6.9 82,877 2.7 Houston, Texas 326,535 6.7 404,897 13.1 Atlanta, Georgia 309,639 6.4   Las Vegas, Nevada 277,503 5.7 357,049 11.6 Orlando, Florida 274,569 5.7 167,194 5.4 Tampa, Florida 257,963 5.3 303,157 9.8 Raleigh, North Carolina 222,019 4.6   Denver, Colorado 196,110 4.0 194,962 6.3 San Diego/Inland Empire, California 158,095 3.3 135,078 4.4 St. Louis, Missouri 123,022 2.5 120,020 3.9 Austin, Texas 117,855 2.4 73,782 2.4 Phoenix, Arizona 113,370 2.3 177,072 5.7 Louisville, Kentucky 79,659 1.6 78,758 2.6 Corpus Christi, Texas 56,067 1.2 54,781 1.8 Other 102,596 2.1 91,382 2.9 Total properties held for investment 4,860,799 100.0 % 3,087,018 100.0 % Properties held for sale 172,112 62,418 Total real estate assets, at cost $ 4,688,687 $ 3,024,600 Liquidity and Capital Resources We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility, which we believe enhances our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available. We intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by:  using what management believes is a prudent combination of debt and common and preferred equity;  extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where possible;  managing interest rate exposure using what management believes are prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt;  borrowing on an unsecured basis in order to maintain a substantial number of unencumbered assets; and  maintaining conservative coverage ratios. Our interest expense coverage ratio, net of capitalized interest, was 2.8, 3.0 and 2.9 times for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest expense coverage ratio is derived by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of income from continuing operations before gain on sale of properties, impairment loss on land held for sale, equity in income of joint ventures and minority interests, depreciation, amortization, interest expense and income from discontinued operations. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, 78.8%, 88.6% and 85.1%, respectively, of our properties (based on invested capital) were unencumbered. Our weighted average maturity of debt, excluding our line of credit, was 6.1 years at December 31, 2005 and 6.5 years at December 31, 2004 and 2003. As a result of the significant cash flow generated by our operations, the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other short-term borrowings, proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments and access to the capital markets by issuing securities under our shelf registration statement, we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs during 2006 including:  operating expenses;  current debt service requirements;  recurring capital expenditures;  initial funding of property developments, acquisitions and mezzanine financings; and  distributions on our common and preferred equity. We consider our long-term liquidity requirements to be the repayment of maturing debt, including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit used to fund development and acquisition activities. We intend to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through the use of common and preferred equity capital, senior unsecured debt and property dispositions. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $200.8 million in 2005 from $157.0 million in 2004, primarily due to additional net operating income from recently acquired properties, including properties acquired in connection with the Summit merger. This increase was partially offset by the loss of net operating income due to the sale of properties, including 12 properties contributed to joint ventures in March 2005, an increase in interest expense due to debt assumed in the Summit merger and other transactional expenses. See further discussion of our 2005 operations compared to 2004 in our Results of Operations discussion. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2005 totaled $207.6 million compared to $65.3 million in 2004. Investing activities in 2005 primarily consisted of transactions associated with the Summit merger and expenditures related to real estate assets. During 2005, we paid $509.8 million in connection with the Summit merger, either as consideration paid at acquisition or for merger liabilities assumed. These payments were ultimately funded using a portion of the proceeds received from the sales of properties and technology investments and distributions from joint ventures representing returns of investments, which totaled an aggregate of $555.7 million. The Company incurred $301.6 million in property development, acquisition and capital improvement costs in 2005 as compared to $109.3 million in 2004. Proceeds received from sales of properties and technology investments and joint venture distributions representing returns of investments totaled $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $6.0 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the issuance of $250.0 million senior unsecured notes in June 2005 and a net increase in our unsecured line of credit due to two property acquisitions during 2005 and the repayment of one medium-term note and six conventional mortgage loans, offset by the repayment of a secured credit facility assumed in our merger with Summit and distributions to shareholders and minority interest holders. Net cash used in financing activities in 2004 was $92.8 million, due to the repayment of notes payable, distributions paid to shareholders and minority interest holders and the redemption of preferred units totaling $451.9 million. These financing outflows were offset from proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable and an increase in our unsecured line of credit totaling $358.7 million. Financial Flexibility In January 2005, we entered into a new credit agreement which increased our credit facility to $600 million, with the ability to further increase it up to $750 million. This $600 million unsecured line of credit matures in January 2008. The scheduled interest rate is based on spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Prime Rate. The scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change. Advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. These bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of $300 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit. The line of credit provides us with additional liquidity to pursue development and acquisition opportunities, as well as lowers our overall cost of funds. The line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations, all of which we were in compliance with at December 31, 2005. Our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to $100 million in letters of credit. While our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line, it does reduce the amount available. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $29.4 million, and had $319.6 million available under our unsecured line of credit. As part of the Merger Agreement, we assumed Summits unsecured letter of credit facility, which matures in July 2008 and has a total commitment of $20.0 million. The letters of credit issued under this facility serve as collateral for performance on contracts and as credit guarantees to banks and insurers. As of December 31, 2005, there were $8.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility. As an alternative to our unsecured line of credit, we from time to time borrow using competitively bid unsecured short-term notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group. Such borrowings vary in term and pricing and are typically priced at interest rates below those available under the unsecured line of credit. At December 31, 2005, $285.5 million was available for future issuance in debt securities, preferred shares, common shares or warrants from our $1.1 billion shelf registration. We have significant unencumbered real estate assets which could be sold or used as collateral for financing purposes should other sources of capital not be available. The following table summarizes our unsecured notes payable issued during 2005 from our $1.1 billion shelf registration statement: Type and Amount Month of Issuance Terms Coupon Rate Maturity Date Interest Paid Proceeds, Net of Issuance Costs $250.0 million senior unsecured notes 6/05 Interest only 5.0 % 6/15/15 June 15 and December 15 $246.8 million We may redeem the notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount and accrued interest, plus a make-whole provision. The notes are direct, senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. We used the net proceeds to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured line of credit. During 2005, we repaid $25.0 million in maturing medium-term notes with an effective interest rate of 3.6%. These medium-term notes had previously been issued by Summit prior to the effective time of the merger. Additionally, we repaid six conventional mortgage notes totaling $40.8 million which had a weighted average interest rate of 7.3%. We repaid all notes payable using proceeds available under our unsecured line of credit to take advantage of lower borrowing rates. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the weighted average interest rate on our floating rate debt, which includes our unsecured line of credit, was 4.5% and 2.5%, respectively. Subsequent to year-end, we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement with respect to our $600 million unsecured credit facility. The amendment extended the maturity of the credit facility by two years to January 2010 and amended certain covenants in the credit agreement. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Debt maturities $ 2,633.1 $ 213.6 $ 232.9 $ 451.7 $ 198.2 $ 452.8 $ 1,083.9 Interest payments (1) 698.5 136.6 120.3 100.5 86.8 69.0 185.3 Non-cancelable operating lease payments 18.0 2.2 2.1 1.9 1.5 1.4 8.9 Construction contracts 212.5 194.4 18.1     $ 3,562.1 $ 546.8 $ 373.4 $ 554.1 $ 286.5 $ 523.2 $ 1,278.1 (1) Includes contractual interest payments for our line of credit, senior unsecured notes, medium-term notes and secured notes. The interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates and our line of credit were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2005. The joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded with secured, third-party debt. We are not committed to any additional funding on third-party debt in relation to our joint ventures. Market Risk We use fixed and floating rate debt to finance acquisitions, developments and maturing debt. These transactions expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Managements policy is to review our borrowings and attempt to mitigate interest rate exposure through the use of long-term debt maturities and derivative instruments, where appropriate. As of December 31, 2005, we had no derivative instruments outstanding. For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common shareholders or cash flows. Conversely, for floating rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common shareholders and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2005, we had fixed rate debt of $2,285.2 million and floating rate debt of $347.9 million. Holding other variables constant (such as debt levels), a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately $93.5 million. The net income available to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately $3.5 million, holding all other variables constant. Results of Operations Changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to acquisitions, dispositions, the performance of the stabilized properties in the portfolio, and the lease-up of newly constructed properties. Where appropriate, comparisons are made on a dollars-per-weighted-average-apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period. Selected weighted averages for the three years ended December 31, 2005 are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Average monthly property revenue per apartment home $ 842 $ 756 $ 736 Annualized total property expenses per apartment home $ 3,924 $ 3,701 $ 3,541 Weighted average number of operating apartment homes owned 100% 51,847 43,132 42,434 Weighted average occupancy of operating apartment homes owned 100% 95.0 % 94.0 % 92.9 % 2005 Compared to 2004 Income from continuing operations increased $129.3 million, or 480.6%, from $26.9 million to $156.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increase in income from continuing operations was due to many factors, which included, but were not limited to, gains recognized on property sales and technology investments and increases in property net operating income. These increases were partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and interest expense as a result of our merger with Summit. The primary financial focus for our apartment communities is net operating income. Net operating income represents total property revenues less total property expenses. Net operating income increased $88.7 million, or 38.3%, from $231.9 million to $320.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. See further discussion of net operating income in our discussion of Segment Reporting in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the components of net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: ($ in thousands) Apartment Homes Year Ended December 31, Change at 12/31/05 2005 2004 $ % Property revenues Camden same store communities 37,336 $ 338,483 $ 327,493 $ 10,990 3.4 % Summit same store communities 10,678 108,383  108,383 100.0 Camden non-same store communities 3,266 32,120 22,698 9,422 41.5 Summit non-same store communities 2,705 29,820  29,820 100.0 Development and lease-up communities 3,031 806  806 100.0 Dispositions/other  14,478 41,342 (26,864 ) (65.0 ) Total property revenues 57,016 524,090 391,533 132,557 33.9 Property expenses Camden same store communities 37,336 139,519 134,925 4,594 3.4 Summit same store communities 10,678 36,317  36,317 100.0 Camden non-same store communities 3,266 11,562 9,282 2,280 24.6 Summit non-same store communities 2,705 10,811  10,811 100.0 Development and lease-up communities 3,031 548  548 100.0 Dispositions/other  4,684 15,420 (10,736 ) (69.6 ) Total property expenses 57,016 203,441 159,627 43,814 27.4 Property net operating income Camden same store communities 37,336 198,964 192,568 6,396 3.3 Summit same store communities 10,678 72,066  72,066 100.0 Camden non-same store communities 3,266 20,558 13,416 7,142 53.2 Summit non-same store communities 2,705 19,009  19,009 100.0 Development and lease-up communities 3,031 258  258 100.0 Dispositions/other  9,794 25,922 (16,128 ) (62.2 ) Total net operating income 57,016 $ 320,649 $ 231,906 $ 88,743 38.3 % Same store communities are communities we (or Summit) owned and were stabilized as of January 1, 2004. Non-same store communities are stabilized communities we (or Summit) have acquired or developed after January 1, 2004. Development and lease-up communities are non-stabilized communities we (or Summit) have developed or acquired after January 1, 2004. Dispositions represent communities we have sold which are not included in discontinued operations. Dispositions/other revenues for 2005 also includes $2.8 million in amortization of above and below market leases acquired in our merger with Summit and our acquisitions of Camden World Gateway and Camden Gaines Ranch during 2005. Total property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $132.6 million over 2004, and increased from $756 to $842 on an annualized monthly per apartment home basis. Total property revenues from Camden same store properties increased 3.4%, from $327.5 million for 2004 to $338.5 million for 2005, which represents an increase of $25 on an annualized monthly per apartment home basis. For same store properties, rental rates on a monthly per apartment home basis increased $13 from 2004 to 2005 and vacancy loss decreased $12 per apartment home over the same period. Rental rate increases were achieved due to improved market conditions in many of our markets that are now favoring multifamily owners. Total property revenues from Summit same store properties were $108.4 million for the ten months ended December 31, 2005, or $1,015 on a monthly per apartment home basis. Property revenues from Camden non-same store, development and lease-up properties, including Summit non-same store properties, increased from $22.7 million for 2004 to $62.7 million for 2005 due to the acquisition of apartment homes in the Summit merger and the completion and lease-up of properties in our development pipeline. Total property revenues on a monthly per apartment home basis were $1,099 and $1,073 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Property revenues from disposition properties during 2005 decreased $26.9 million as compared to 2004. Disposition property revenues primarily relates to 12 properties contributed to joint ventures during March 2005. As we have continuing involvement in these communities, the results of operations from these communities are included in continuing operations. Total property expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $43.8 million, or 27.4%, as compared to 2004, and increased from $3,701 to $3,924 on an annualized per apartment home basis. Total property expenses from our same store properties increased 3.4%, from $134.9 million for 2004 to $139.5 million for 2005, which represents an increase of $123 on a per apartment home basis. The increase in same store property expenses per apartment home is primarily due to increases in salary and benefit expenses, real estate tax expense and utility expenses of $47, $37 and $35, respectively, on a per apartment home basis. Property expenses from Summits same store properties were $36.3 million for the ten months ended December 31, 2005, or $4,081 on an annualized per apartment home basis. Property expenses from our non-same store, development and lease-up properties, including Summit non-same store properties, increased from $9.3 million for 2004 to $22.9 million for 2005, due to the acquisition of apartment homes in the Summit merger and the completion and lease-up of properties in our development pipeline. Total property expenses on an annualized per apartment home basis were $4,819 and $5,268 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Expenses on a per apartment home basis are higher for development and lease-up communities due to certain costs, such as employee related costs, property taxes and utility costs, that are not driven by occupancy levels. Property expenses from disposition properties decreased $10.7 million, as compared to 2004. Fee and asset management income during the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $3.7 million over 2004. This increase was primarily due to fees earned on services provided to our joint ventures, as well as fees earned from our mezzanine financing program, offset by declines in construction and development fees earned on third-party construction projects. Income from the sale of technology investments totaled $24.2 million for 2005, compared to $0.9 million for 2004. Income from the sale of technology investments for 2005 primarily relates to a gain recognized on the sale of our investment in Rent.com, which was acquired by eBay Inc. during the first quarter of 2005. Interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $3.7 million from the same period in 2004. This decrease was primarily attributable to proceeds received in 2004 from an insurance settlement for lost rents of $1.7 million and $2.0 million of additional interest income received from our mezzanine financing program in 2004 as compared to 2005. The decrease in mezzanine financing interest income is due to the repayment of eight loans totaling $31.4 million during 2005. Property management expense, which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, increased from $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to salary and benefit expenses related to the addition of regional supervision personnel, as well as the expense associated with regional offices acquired in the Summit merger. Property management expenses were 3.1% and 3.0% of total property revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Fee and asset management expense, which represents expenses related to third-party construction projects and property management for third parties, increased from $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $6.9 for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to warranty expense and repair expense on third-party projects which totaled $3.4 and $1.0 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $6.3 million from $18.5 million in 2004 to $24.8 million in 2005, but decreased as a percent of total revenues from 4.5% to 4.4% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increases in expenses were primarily due to costs associated with pursuing potential transactions that were not consummated, increases in salary and benefit expenses, including the addition of internal audit, information technology and personnel associated with the Summit merger, and professional fees associated with compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and information technology projects. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we incurred transaction compensation and merger expenses of $14.1 million. Transaction compensation expenses represented bonuses paid in connection with the sale of the Rent.com investment and the successful completion of the merger with Summit. Merger expenses primarily related to training and transitional employee costs. Gross interest cost before interest capitalized to development properties increased $40.5 million, or 45.8%, from $88.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $129.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances due to $880.8 million in notes and mortgages payable acquired in the merger with Summit. Interest capitalized increased from $9.3 million to $17.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, due to higher average balances in our development pipeline primarily as a result of development properties acquired in our merger with Summit. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $98.0 million for 2004 to $164.1 million for 2005. This increase was due primarily to additional amortization of $32.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 related to in-place leases acquired in connection with the merger with Summit, as well as additional depreciation on assets acquired, new development and capital improvements placed in service during the past year, partially offset by the disposition of properties. Gain on sale of properties for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $132.9 million included a gain of $132.1 million from the contribution of 12 properties to joint ventures and $0.8 million related to the sale of undeveloped land. Gain on sale of properties for the year ended December 31, 2004 included a gain of $1.6 million from the sale of 12.5 acres of undeveloped land located in Houston. Equity in income of joint ventures increased $9.7 million from 2004, primarily from gains recognized on the sale of three properties held in joint ventures in 2005. Our portion of the gain recognized on these property sales totaled $11.2 million during 2005. This increase was partially offset by losses recognized in one joint venture due to debt retirement costs associated with the refinancing of debt during the third quarter of 2005. Our portion of the debt retirement costs was approximately $2.0 million for 2005. Distributions on units convertible into perpetual preferred shares decreased from $10.5 million for 2004 to $7.0 million for 2005, as a result of the redemption of $53 million Series C preferred units in September 2004 and January 2005. Original issuance costs of $0.4 million were expensed in connection with the redemption of $17.5 million of Series C preferred units in 2005 and original issuance costs of $0.7 million were expensed in 2004. The $1.1 million impairment loss on land held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2004 related to 2.4 acres of undeveloped land located in Dallas, which was classified as held for sale during 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, income from discontinued operations included the results of operations of seven operating properties classified as held for sale at December 31, 2005 and the results of operations of three operating properties sold in 2005 including the related gain on sale. One property sold during 2005 was acquired in the Summit merger and its results are from the effective date of the merger through its sale date. In addition to the properties included in discontinued operations for 2005, for the year ended December 31, 2004, income from discontinued operations included the results of operations of one operating property sold during 2004. 2004 Compared to 2003 Income from continuing operations increased $4.6 million, or 20.8%, from $22.3 million to $26.9 million, for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The increase in income from continuing operations was due to many factors, which included, but were not limited to, increases in property net operating income and other non-property related revenues. These increases were partially offset by increases in corporate expenses, primarily increases in property management expenses and general and administrative expenses, interest expense and decreases in income from joint ventures. Net operating income increased $7.2 million, or 3.2%, from $224.7 million to $231.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The following table presents the components of net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: ($ in thousands) Apartment Homes Year Ended December 31, Change at 12/31/04 2004 2003 $ % Property revenues Same store communities 40,946 $ 360,872 $ 357,327 $ 3,545 1.0 % Non-same store communities 1,988 22,600 15,459 7,141 46.2 Development and lease-up communities 1,188 7,528 1,530 5,998 392.0 Dispositions/other  533 629 (96 ) (15.3 ) Total property revenues 44,122 391,533 374,945 16,588 4.4 Property expenses Same store communities 40,946 147,429 143,004 4,425 3.1 Non-same store communities 1,988 8,688 6,502 2,186 33.6 Development and lease-up communities 1,188 3,269 498 2,771 556.4 Dispositions/other  241 258 (17 ) (6.6 ) Total property expenses 44,122 159,627 150,262 9,365 6.2 Property net operating income Same store communities 40,946 213,443 214,323 (880 ) (0.4 ) Non-same store communities 1,988 13,912 8,957 4,955 55.3 Development and lease-up communities 1,188 4,259 1,032 3,227 312.7 Dispositions/other  292 371 (79 ) (21.3 ) Total net operating income 44,122 $ 231,906 $ 224,683 $ 7,223 3.2 % Same store communities are stabilized communities we have owned since January 1, 2003. Non-same store communities are stabilized communities we have acquired or developed since January 1, 2003. Development and lease-up communities are non-stabilized communities we have developed or acquired after January 1, 2003. Dispositions represent communities we have sold since January 1, 2003, which are not included in discontinued operations. Total property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 4.4% as compared to 2003, and increased from $736 to $756 on a monthly per apartment home basis. Total property revenues from our same store properties increased 1.0%, from $357.3 million for 2003 to $360.9 million for 2004, which represents an increase of $7 on a monthly per apartment home basis. For same store properties, vacancy loss decreased $9 per apartment home from 2004 to 2005, offset by rental rates which decreased $3 over the same period. Property revenues from our non-same store, development and lease-up properties increased from $17.0 million for 2003 to $30.1 million for 2004 due to the completion and lease-up of properties in our development pipeline. Total property expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $9.4 million, or 6.2%, as compared to 2003, and increased from $3,541 to $3,701 on an annualized per apartment home basis. Total property expenses from our same store properties increased 3.1%, from $143.0 million for 2003 to $147.4 million for 2004, which represents an increase of $108 on an annualized per apartment home basis. The increase in same store property expenses per apartment home was primarily due to increases in salary and benefit expenses, property insurance expense and utility expenses of $50, $30 and $17 on a per apartment home basis. Property expenses from our non-same store, development and lease-up properties increased from $7.0 million for 2003 to $12.0 million for 2004, which was consistent with the growth in revenues during the same period. Fee and asset management revenues during the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $1.9 million over 2003. This increase was primarily due to construction and development fees earned on third-party projects and fees earned on our mezzanine financing program. Interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $5.4 million from 2003. Interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2004 included interest income of $9.3 million from our mezzanine financing program and $1.7 million related to an insurance settlement for lost rents related to a fire at one of our communities in 2000. Interest and other income for 2003 included interest income of $3.9 million from our mezzanine financing program and $1.2 million in revenues from townhome sales. Property management expense, which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, increased from $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to increases in salary and benefit expenses related to the addition of regional supervision personnel, and increases in incentive compensation expense. Fee and asset management expense, which represents expenses related to third-party construction projects and property management for third parties, remained constant at $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. General and administrative expenses increased $2.3 million from $16.2 million in 2003 to $18.5 million in 2004, and increased as a percent of total revenues from 4.2% to 4.5%. The increase in expense was primarily due to increases in salary and benefit expenses including expenses associated with share-based compensation, and costs associated with compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Gross interest cost before interest capitalized to development properties decreased $1.9 million, or 2.1%, from $90.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $88.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The overall decrease in interest expense was due to declines in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt, declines in variable interest rates, and savings from the refinancing of maturing debt at lower rates. This decrease was partially offset by higher average debt balances that were incurred to fund our increase in real estate assets. Interest capitalized decreased from $15.1 million to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, due to lower average balances in our development pipeline. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $96.6 million for 2003 to $98.0 million for 2004. This increase was primarily due to new development and capital improvements placed in service and issuance of new debt during 2004. Gain on sale of properties for the year ended December 31, 2004 included a gain of $1.6 million from the sale of 12.5 acres of undeveloped land located in Houston. Gain on sale of land of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 was from the sale of 61.1 acres of undeveloped land located in Houston. Equity in income of joint ventures decreased $2.8 million from 2003, primarily from gains recognized on sale of properties held in joint ventures in 2003. Our portion of the gain recognized on these property sales totaled $1.4 million during 2003. Distributions on units convertible into perpetual preferred shares decreased from $12.7 million for 2003 to $10.5 million for 2004, as a result of an amendment to the terms of the Series B preferred units which was effective beginning December 1, 2003, as well as the redemption of $35.5 million in Series C preferred units in September 2004. Original issuance costs of $0.7 million were expensed in connection with the redemption of the Series C preferred units in 2004. The $1.1 million impairment loss on land held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2004 related to 2.4 acres of undeveloped land located in Dallas, which was classified as held for sale during 2004. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, income from discontinued operations included the results of operations of seven operating properties classified as held for sale at December 31, 2005 and the results of operations of three operating properties sold in 2005. In addition to the properties included in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, income from discontinued operations included the results of operations of one operating property sold during 2004. Funds from Operations (FFO) Management considers FFO to be an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) currently defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from depreciable operating property sales, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Diluted FFO also assumes conversion of all dilutive convertible securities, including convertible minority interests, which are convertible into common shares. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and data included elsewhere in this report. FFO is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance. Furthermore, FFO as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation. Reconciliations of net income to diluted FFO for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: (in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Funds from operations Net income $ 199,086 $ 41,341 $ 29,430 Real estate depreciation, including discontinued operations 168,777 104,339 103,354 Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures (6,867 ) 2,097 678 Gain on sale of properties, including discontinued operations (168,221 ) (8,368 )  Income allocated to common units, including discontinued operations 2,515 4,260 2,237 Funds from operations  diluted $ 195,290 $ 143,669 $ 135,699 Weighted average shares - basic 52,000 41,430 39,355 Incremental shares issuable from assumed conversion of: Common share options and awards granted 483 434 1,433 Common units 3,830 2,438 2,446 Weighted average shares  diluted 56,313 44,302 43,234 Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures included in FFO for 2005 include gains totaling $11.2 million from the sale of properties held in joint ventures. Included in the $11.2 million in gains recognized is $0.3 million in prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of mortgages associated with the sold properties. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2003 previously included a reduction of $2.6 million from gains recognized on sales of undepreciated property. We have adjusted FFO to include these types of gains as they do not meet NAREITs definition of gains that should be adjusted from net income in calculating FFO. Inflation We lease apartments under lease terms generally ranging from 6 to 13 months. Management believes that such short-term lease contracts lessen the impact of inflation due to the ability to adjust rental rates to market levels as leases expire. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of a companys financial condition and results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The more significant of these policies relate to cost capitalization and asset impairment, which are discussed in the Business section under Property Update, and income recognition, capital expenditures and notes receivable, which are discussed below. Income recognition. Our rental and other property income is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned. Other property income consists primarily of utility rebillings, and administrative, application and other transactional fees charged to our residents. Retail lease income is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any construction period if we are determined not to be the owner of the tenant improvements. Interest, fee and asset management and all other sources of income are recognized as earned. Capital expenditures. We capitalize renovation and improvement costs that we believe extend the economic lives and enhance the earnings of the related assets. Capital expenditures, including carpet, appliances and HVAC unit replacements, subsequent to initial construction are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20 years. Notes receivabl e. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our notes receivable. If we identify that the borrower is unable to perform its duties under the notes receivable or that the operations of the property do not support the continued recognition of interest income or the carrying value of the loan, we then cease income recognition and record an impairment charge against the loan. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures. Our more significant estimates relate to determining the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisitions, estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying value of our real estate assets, estimates of the useful lives of our assets, reserves related to co-insurance requirements under our property, general liability and employee benefit insurance programs and estimates of expected losses of variable interest entities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized over their vesting periods in the income statement based on their estimated fair values. In April 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Shared-Based Payment providing for a phased-in implementation process for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R is effective for all public entities in the first annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, which for us is calendar year 2006. Based upon our preliminary assessments surrounding the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we have determined there will not be a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, which addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. It also specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 was effective beginning July 1, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FASB Interpretation (FIN) 46R-5, Implicit Variable Interest under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This FSP requires a reporting entity to consider whether it holds an implicit variable interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) or potential VIE. FSP FIN 46R-5 was effective with reporting periods beginning after March 3, 2005. The adoption of FSP FIN 46R-5 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. A conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity when the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be in the control of the entity. This legal obligation is absolute, despite the uncertainty regarding the timing and/or method of settlement. In addition, the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred; generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and/or through normal operation of the asset. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 was effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. This Statement also provides that (1) a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long-lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate (prospectively) that was effected by a change in accounting principle, and (2) corrections of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement. The new standard was effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-05, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. EITF Issue No. 04-05 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls, and should consolidate, a limited partnership or a similar entity. EITF Issue No. 04-05 was effective after June 29, 2005, for all newly formed limited partnerships and for any pre-existing limited partnerships that modify their partnership agreements after that date. General partners of all other limited partnerships are required to apply the consensus no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-05 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued FSP 78-9-1, Interaction of AICPA Statement of Position 78-9 and EITF Issue No. 04-05. The EITF acknowledged that the consensus in EITF Issue No. 04-05 conflicts with certain aspects of Statement of Position (SOP) 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. The EITF agreed that the assessment of whether a general partner, or the general partners as a group, controls a limited partnership should be consistent for all limited partnerships, irrespective of the industry within which the limited partnership operates. Accordingly, the guidance in SOP 78-9 was amended in FSP 78-9-1 to be consistent with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 04-05. The effective dates for this FSP are the same as those mentioned above in EITF Issue No. 04-05. The adoption of FSP 78-9-1 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Matters We submitted an unqualified Section 12 (a) CEO certification to the NYSE during 2005. We filed with the SEC the CEO and CFO certifications required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Trust Managers and the Shareholders of Camden Property Trust We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Camden Property Trust and subsidiaries (the Trust) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Business Camden Property Trust is a self-administered and self-managed Texas real estate investment trust (REIT) organized on May 25, 1993. We, with our subsidiaries, report as a single business segment with activities related to the ownership, development, construction and management of multifamily apartment communities. Our use of the term communities, multifamily communities, properties, or multifamily properties in the following discussion refers to our multifamily apartment communities. As of December 31, 2005, we owned interests in, operated or were developing 200 multifamily properties containing 68,791 apartment homes located in thirteen states. We had 3,211 apartment homes under development at nine of our multifamily properties, including 464 apartment homes at one multifamily property owned through a joint venture. We had seven properties containing 2,956 apartment homes which were designated as held for sale. Additionally, we had several sites that we intend to develop into multifamily apartment communities. As of December 31, 2005, we had operating properties in 22 markets. No single market contributed more than 10% of our net operating income (as defined in reportable segments at Note 2) for the year then ended. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Washington, D.C. Metro, Dallas and Tampa contributed 9.9%, 8.2% and 8.2%, respectively, to our net operating income. Merger with Summit Properties Inc. On February 28, 2005, Summit Properties Inc. (Summit) was merged with and into Camden Summit Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (Camden Summit), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 4, 2004 (the Merger Agreement), as amended. We determined the merger would allow us to lower our concentrations in Las Vegas, Houston and Dallas and increase our presence on the East coast, and accomplish this diversification strategy in a matter of months rather than what would have otherwise taken years. We acquired a significant portfolio of high-quality apartment properties, most of which were located in new, East coast markets such as Southeast Florida, Washington, D.C. Metro and Atlanta. These properties complemented our existing footprint in Florida and North Carolina while further diversifying our portfolio with the addition of new markets. Prior to the effective time of the merger, Summit was the sole general partner of Summit Properties Partnership, L.P. (the Camden Summit Partnership). At the effective time, Camden Summit became the sole general partner of the Camden Summit Partnership and the name of such partnership was changed to Camden Summit Partnership, L.P. As of February 28, 2005, Summit owned or held an ownership interest in 48 operating communities comprised of 15,002 apartment homes with an additional 1,834 apartment homes under construction in five new communities. The aggregate consideration paid for the merger was as follows: (in thousands) Fair value of Camden common shares issued $ 544,065 Fair value of Camden Summit Partnership units issued 81,564 Cash consideration paid for Summit common shares and partnership units exchanged 458,050 Total consideration 1,083,679 Fair value of liabilities assumed, including debt 982,966 Total purchase price $ 2,066,645 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Summit stockholders had the opportunity to elect to receive cash or Camden shares for their Summit stock. Each stockholders election was subject to proration, depending on the elections of all Summit stockholders, so that the aggregate amount of cash issued in the merger to Summits stockholders equaled approximately $436.3 million. As a result of this proration, Summit stockholders electing Camden shares received approximately .6383 of a Camden share and $1.4177 in cash for each of their shares of Summit common stock. The final conversion ratio of the common shares was determined based on the average market price of our common shares over a five day trading period preceding the effective time of the merger. Fractional shares were paid in cash. Summit stockholders electing cash or who made no effective election, received $31.20 in cash for each of their Summit shares. In the merger, we issued approximately 11.8 million common shares to Summit stockholders. In conjunction with the merger, the limited partners in the Camden Summit Partnership were offered, on a unit-by-unit basis, the opportunity to redeem their partnership units for $31.20 in cash, without interest, or to remain in the Camden Summit Partnership following the merger at a unit valuation equal to ..6687 of a Camden common share. The limited partner elections resulted in the redemption of 0.7 million partnership units for cash, for an aggregate of $21.7 million, and the issuance of 1.8 million partnership units. The value of the common shares and partnership units issued was determined based on the average market price of our common shares for the five day period commencing two days prior to the announcement of the merger on October 4, 2004. Subsequent to the merger, 0.1 million partnership units have been redeemed for $5.7 million. We allocated the purchase price between tangible and intangible assets. When allocating the purchase price to acquired properties, we allocated costs to the estimated intangible value of in-place leases and above or below market leases and to the estimated fair value of furniture and fixtures, land and buildings on a value determined by assuming the property was vacant by applying methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of income-producing property. Depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. Buildings and furniture and fixtures have an estimated useful life of 35 years and 5 years, respectively. The value of in-place leases and above or below market leases is being amortized over the estimated average remaining life of leases in-place at the time of the merger. In-place lease terms generally range from 6 to 13 months. We used an estimated remaining average lease life of 10 months to amortize the value of in-place leases recorded in conjunction with the merger. Amortization expense for in-place leases recorded at the time of merger totaled $31.7 million in 2005. In-place leases recorded at the time of merger were fully amortized as of December 31, 2005. The allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, these allocations are subject to revision when we receive final information, including appraisals and other analyses. Revisions to the fair value estimates, which may be significant, will be recorded as further adjustments to the purchase price allocations. Revisions to the purchase price allocations during 2005 included reductions of $3.4 million due to the write-down of a property classified as held for sale which was sold in July 2005 and adjustments to retail lease commission balances, offset by increases of $3.9 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and $0.4 million to other minority interests. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of merger, net of cash acquired: (in thousands) Land $ 298,022 Buildings and improvements 1,528,101 Properties under development, including land 152,470 Investments in joint ventures 2,65
