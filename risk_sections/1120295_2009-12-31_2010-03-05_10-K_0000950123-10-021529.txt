Item 1A. Risk Factors The statements that are not historical facts contained in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect the current belief, expectations or intent of our management and are subject to and involve certain risks and uncertainties. Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside of our control and are difficult for us to forecast or mitigate. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in certain of our other Securities and Exchange Act Commission filings, the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by us in any forward-looking statements contained herein or made elsewhere by or on behalf of us. Our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and market conditions Our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the United States and globally and, in particular, market conditions in the communications and networking industries. In the past, our operating results were adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced or deferred capital spending in the United States, Europe and Asia. The current global financial crisis has included, among other things, significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other credit providers, substantial reductions and/or fluctuations in equity and currency values worldwide, and concerns that the worldwide economy may be in a prolonged recessionary period. Unfavorable changes in economic and market conditions such as these would likely result in lower capital spending by our customers on test and measurement solutions, and therefore demand for our products would decline, adversely impacting our revenue. Challenging economic and market conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for the products and services they have purchased. As a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, prolonged unfavorable economic conditions and market turbulence may also negatively impact our contract manufacturers and suppliers capability to timely supply and manufacture our products, thereby impairing our ability to meet our contractual obligations to our customers. These potential effects, as well as any other currently unforeseeable effects, of the current global financial crisis are difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a result, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition. Acquisitions undertaken and any that we may undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and significantly harm our operating results Acquisitions are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We expect to continue to review opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies that would add to our existing product line, complement and enhance our current products, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. While we are not currently a party to any pending acquisition agreements, we may acquire additional businesses, products or technologies in the future. If we make any further acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing shareholders percentage ownership, and we could incur substantial debt or assume liabilities. We have limited experience in acquiring and integrating other businesses and technologies, and as a result, we may not fully realize the expected benefits of an acquisition. During 2009, we completed the acquisition of Catapult Communications Corporation (Catapult) and the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of N2X Data Network Testing Product Line (N2X Business) from Agilent Technologies, Inc. (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:  problems or delays in assimilating or transitioning (from a larger organization) the acquired operations, systems, processes, controls, technologies, products, or personnel;  loss of acquired customer accounts; 17 Table of Contents  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;  multiple and overlapping product lines as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays;  higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products;  diversion of managements attention from our core business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions;  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, licensors, contract manufacturers, customers and industry experts;  we may incur significant impairment, exit and/or restructuring charges if the products or technologies acquired in an acquisition do not meet our sales expectations or are unsuccessful;  insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and  potential loss of the acquired organizations or our own key employees. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and we cannot be certain that we would be successful in overcoming problems in connection with our past or future acquisitions, and our inability to do so could significantly harm our assets acquired in such acquisitions, revenues and results of operations. Because we depend on a limited number of customers for a majority of our revenues, any cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by one of these customers could significantly harm our revenues and results of operations Historically, a small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues. Specifically, sales to our largest customer, Cisco Systems, accounted for 15.6% of our total revenues in 2009, 21.0% of our total revenues in 2008 and 23.9% of our total revenues in 2007. We expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future and that our operating results will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of customers. Our dependence on large orders from a limited number of customers makes our relationships with these customers critical to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our largest customers, that we will be able to increase our sales to our other existing customers or that we will be able to attract additional customers. From time to time, we have experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. In addition, our customers have sought price reductions or other concessions from us and will likely continue to do so. We typically do not have long-term or volume purchase contracts with our customers, and our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty and are free to purchase products from our competitors. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or delay in sales to one of these customers, our inability to successfully develop and maintain relationships with existing and new customers, or requirements that we make price reductions or other concessions could significantly harm our revenues and results of operations. 18 Table of Contents Competition in our market could significantly harm our results of operations The market for our products is highly competitive. We face competition primarily from wireline and wireless test equipment manufacturers such as Spirent Communications, JDS Uniphase Corporation, NetHawk Oyj and Anritsu. We also compete with a number of other small companies which are focused on network performance analysis and measurement, and converged monitoring test. Additionally, some of our significant customers have developed, or may develop, in-house performance analysis products for their own use or for sale to others. For example, Cisco Systems, our largest customer, has used internally developed test products for a number of years. Although Cisco Systems has in the past accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, we cannot be certain that it will continue to do so. As we broaden our product offerings, we may move into new markets and face additional competition. Moreover, our competitors may have more experience operating in these new markets and be better established with the customers in these new markets. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities than we do. Moreover, our competitors may consolidate with each other, or with other companies, giving them even greater capabilities with which to compete against us. Increased competition in the IP-based wired and wireless network performance analysis and measurement markets could result in increased pressure on us to reduce prices and could result in a reduction in our revenues and/or a decrease in our margins, each of which could significantly harm our results of operations. In addition, increased competition could prevent us from increasing our market share, or cause us to lose our existing market share, either of which would harm our revenues and profitability. We cannot predict whether our current or future competitors will develop or market technologies and products that offer higher performance or more features, or that are more cost-effective than our current or future products. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop cost-effective products and product enhancements which offer higher performance and more functionality. Our failure to do so will harm our revenues and results of operations. If we are unable to successfully introduce new products to keep pace with the rapid technological changes that characterize our market, our results of operations will be significantly harmed The market for our products is characterized by:  rapid technological change such as the recent advancements of IP-based networks and wireless technologies (e.g., LTE);  frequent new product introductions such as higher speed and more complex routers;  evolving industry standards such as new Internet protocols;  changing customer needs such as the increase in advanced IP services agreed to between network service providers and their customers; and  short product life cycles as a result of rapid changes in our customers products. Our performance will depend on our successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced performance analysis products that address new technologies and changes in customer requirements. If we experience any delay in the development or introduction of new products or enhancements to our existing products, our operating results may suffer. For instance, undetected software or hardware errors, which frequently occur when new products are first introduced, could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and the loss of credibility with our customers. In addition, if we are not able to develop, or license or acquire from 19 Table of Contents third parties, the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements, our existing products are likely to become technologically obsolete over time and our operating results will suffer. If the rate of development of new technologies and transmission protocols by our customers is delayed, the growth of the market for our products and therefore our sales and operating results may be harmed. Our ability to successfully introduce new products in a timely fashion will depend on multiple factors, including our ability to:  anticipate technological changes and industry trends;  properly identify customer needs;  innovate and develop and license or acquire new technologies and applications;  hire and retain necessary technical personnel;  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;  timely obtain key components for the manufacture of new products;  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;  price our products competitively; and  differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings. The development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market trends. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely or cost-effective basis. Further, we cannot be certain that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes, emerging industry standards or product announcements by our competitors. If we fail to respond to technological change and the needs of our markets, we will lose revenues and our competitive position will suffer. We depend on sales of a narrow range of products and if customers do not purchase our products, our revenues and results of operations would be significantly harmed Our business and products are concentrated in the market for systems that analyze and measure the performance of wired and wireless IP-based network equipment and systems. This market is an evolving market and there is uncertainty regarding its size and scope. Our performance will depend on increased sales of our existing systems and the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing these sales or in developing and introducing new products. Our failure to do so would significantly harm our revenues and results of operations. Our large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business Large network equipment manufacturers and service providers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. These customers may require us to develop additional features, reduce our prices or grant other concessions. As we seek to sell more products to these large network equipment 20 Table of Contents manufacturers, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions. These terms may affect the amounts and timing of revenue recognition and our margins, which may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition in the affected periods. If we do not diversify our customer base, we may not be able to grow our business or increase our profitability To date, the majority of our total revenues have been generated from sales to network equipment manufacturers. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to diversify our customer base by increasing sales to enterprises, government departments and agencies, network operators and service providers, and communications chip manufacturers. To effectively compete for the business of these customers, we must develop new products and enhancements to existing products and expand our sales, marketing and customer service capabilities, which will result in increases in operating costs. If we cannot offset these increases in costs with an increase in our revenues, our operating results may be adversely affected. Some of our existing and potential competitors have existing relationships with many enterprises, government departments and agencies, network operators and service providers, and communications chip manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing our sales presence in these markets. Any failure by us to increase sales in these markets would adversely affect our growth. Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of new product introductions and other factors, which fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline significantly Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated and may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, most of which are outside of our control. Some of the factors that could cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate include the other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section. We may experience a shortfall or delay in generating or recognizing revenues for a number of reasons. Orders on hand at the beginning of a quarter and orders generated in a quarter do not always result in the shipment of products and the recognition of revenues for that quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of the quarter in which they are ordered or our inability to recognize revenue for products shipped in a quarter may adversely affect our operating results for that quarter. Our agreements with customers typically provide that the customer may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders prior to shipment without penalty. Because we incur operating expenses based on anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term, any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our results of operations. Our operating results may also vary as a result of the timing of our release of new products. The introduction of a new product in any quarter may cause an increase in revenues in that quarter that may not be sustainable in subsequent quarters. Conversely, a delay in introducing a new product in a quarter may result in a decrease in revenues in that quarter and lost sales. In addition, actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements could significantly harm our results of operations. The factors described above are difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a consequence, operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict, and therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price. 21 Table of Contents The loss of any of our key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key management, technical, marketing and sales employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our key employees or that we can attract or retain additional skilled personnel as required. Competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense, and the cost to recruit and train new technical personnel is significant. Moreover, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may be subject to such claims as we seek to retain or hire qualified personnel, some of whom may currently be working for our competitors. Some of these claims may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims, regardless of their merits. Such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us. In addition, volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees who may look to stock-based awards as a key component of their compensation. Many of the stock options held by our employees have an exercise price that is higher (in some cases significantly higher) than the current trading price of our common stock, and these underwater options do not serve their purpose as incentives for our employees to remain with Ixia. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could hinder the development and introduction of new and enhanced products and harm our ability to sell our products. As a result, failure to retain or attract key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position. Continued growth will strain our operations and require us to incur costs to maintain and upgrade our management and operational resources We have experienced growth in our operations, including number of employees, products, facility locations and customers. Unless we manage our growth effectively, we may have difficulty in operating our business. As a result, we may inaccurately forecast sales and materials requirements, fail to integrate new personnel or fail to maintain adequate internal controls or systems, which may result in fluctuations in our operating results and cause the price of our stock to decline. We may continue to expand our operations to enhance our product development efforts and broaden our sales reach, which may place a significant strain on our management and operational resources. In order to manage our growth effectively, we must implement and improve our operational systems, procedures and controls on a timely basis. If we cannot manage growth effectively, our profitability could be significantly harmed. If we are unable to expand our sales and distribution channels or are unable to successfully manage our expanded sales organization, our revenues and results of operations will be harmed Historically, we have relied primarily on a direct sales organization, supported by distributors, to sell our products. Our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and expanding our direct sales organization and our network of distributors and other resellers. We may not be able to successfully expand our sales and distribution channels, and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenues that we generate as a result of the expansion. To the extent that we are successful in expanding our sales and distribution channels, we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against the significantly larger and better-funded sales and marketing operations of many of our current or potential competitors. In some cases, we have granted exclusive rights to our distributors to market our products in their specified territories. Our distributors may not market our products effectively or devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing and technical support. Our inability to effectively manage the expansion of our sales and support staff, or to maintain existing or establish new relationships with successful distributors, would harm our revenues and results of operations. 22 Table of Contents If we are unable to expand our international sales and distribution channels or manage them effectively, our results of operations would be harmed Historically, the majority of our sales have been made to customers in the United States. Our sales based on product shipments and services to the United States accounted for 57.1% of our total revenues in 2009, 64.2% of our total revenues in 2008 and 65.0% of our total revenues in 2007. Historically, distributors have generated a significant portion of our international sales. In the past, we have had distributors who entered bankruptcy and were therefore terminated as distributors of our products. Moreover, if we terminate a distribution relationship for performance-related or other reasons, we may be subject to wrongful termination claims which may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims, regardless of their merits, which could adversely impact our profitability. Losses of one or more of our international distributors or their failure to sell our products would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenues in international markets. We intend to expand into additional international markets in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions by adding distributors and international sales and support personnel. Our failure in these efforts could significantly harm our results of operations and decrease the value of our stock. Changes in industry and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products and asset impairments In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources by restructuring our operations and/or our product offerings. Any decision to limit investment in or dispose of a product offering may result in the recording of special charges to earnings, such as inventory, fixed asset and technology-related write-offs and charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position. Our workforce restructurings can be disruptive We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to the economic environment, performance issues, recent acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. During 2009, we substantially completed two restructurings, and in January 2010, we announced another restructuring primarily related to the acquisition of the N2X Business (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Restructurings, among other things, can result in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected. Some key components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products We and our contract manufacturers currently purchase a number of key components used to manufacture our products from sole or limited sources of supply for which alternative sources may not be available. From time to time, we have experienced shortages of key components, including chips, oscillators and optical modules. We and our contract manufacturers have no guaranteed or long-term supply arrangements for these or other components, including field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, which are integrated circuits that can be repeatedly reprogrammed to perform different sets of functions as required. Financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in market demand for necessary components could limit the availability to us and our contract manufacturers of these components. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. In addition, the purchase of these components on a sole or limited source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems. Consolidation involving suppliers could further reduce the 23 Table of Contents number of alternatives available to us and affect the availability and cost of components. An increase in the cost of components could make our products less competitive and result in lower gross margins. There are limited substitute supplies available for many of these components, including field programmable gate arrays. All of these components are critical to the production of our products, and competition exists with other manufacturers for these key components. In the event that we can no longer obtain materials from a sole source supplier, we might not be able to qualify or identify alternative suppliers in a timely fashion, or at all. Our reported financial results could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill We are required to test annually, and review when circumstances warrant, our goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any future acquisitions, to determine if impairment has occurred. If such assets are deemed impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill would be recognized. This would result in an incremental charge for that quarter which would adversely impact our earnings for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred. For example, such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below the carrying value of our net assets for a sustained period. Recently, the turmoil in credit markets and the broader economy has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks, including ours. Further declines in our stock price or the failure of our stock price to recover from previous declines, as well as any marked decline in our level of revenues or margins, increase the risk that goodwill may become impaired in future periods. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. International activity may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our business We plan to continue to maintain or expand our international operations and sales activities. Operating internationally involves inherent risks that we may not be able to control, including:  difficulties in recruiting, hiring, training and retaining international personnel;  increased complexity and costs of managing international operations;  growing demand for and cost of technical personnel;  increased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;  commercial laws and business practices that favor local competition;  differing labor and employment laws;  changing governmental laws and regulations, including those related to income taxes;  supporting multiple languages;  reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights;  more complicated logistical and distribution arrangements;  political and economic instability; and  difficulties in collecting receivables. 24 Table of Contents The above risks associated with our international operations and sales activities can restrict or adversely affect our ability to sell in international markets, disrupt our business and subject us to additional costs of doing business. Adverse Resolution of Litigation May Harm Our Results of Operations or Financial Condition We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. We cannot provide assurance that we will not be a party to additional lawsuits in the future or that we will be able to favorably resolve our current lawsuits. To the extent lawsuits extend for lengthy time periods or are adversely resolved, our results of operations and financial position could be significantly harmed. For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, contained in Part I of this report. Claims that we infringe third-party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products From time to time, other parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. We cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights or that we do not in fact infringe those intellectual property rights. We have not conducted a search to determine whether the technology we have in our products infringes or misappropriates intellectual property held by third parties. Any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, if determined adversely to us, could significantly harm our results of operations. Any claims, with or without merit, could:  be time-consuming;  result in costly litigation;  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel;  require us to modify the infringing products or to develop alternative technology, thereby causing product shipment delays and the loss or deferral of revenues;  require us to cease selling the products containing the intellectual property at issue;  require us to pay substantial damage awards;  expose us to indemnity claims from our customers;  damage our reputation; or  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement, our revenues, 25 Table of Contents results of operations and competitive position could be harmed. See Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K for additional information. If we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs and experience manufacturing delays We provide our contract manufacturers with rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our manufacturing requirements. Some of the components used in our products have significant lead times or lead times which may unexpectedly increase depending on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and the demand for components at a given time. Because of these long lead times, we are often required to forecast and order products before we know what our specific manufacturing requirements will be. If we overestimate our product orders, our contract manufacturers may have excess inventory of completed products which we would be obligated to purchase. This will lead to increased costs and the risk of obsolescence. If we underestimate our product orders, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory, which could result in delays in shipments, the loss or deferral of revenues and higher costs of sales. Costs are also added to our products when we are required to expedite delivery of our products to customers or of components with long lead times to our contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we will be able to accurately forecast our product orders and may in the future carry excess or obsolete inventory, be unable to fulfill customer demand, or both, thereby harming our revenues, results of operations and customer relationships. Failure by our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products could harm our revenues, results of operations, competitive position and reputation We currently rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to manufacture and assemble our products. We may experience delays in receiving product shipments from contract manufacturers or other problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product. We cannot be certain that we will be able to effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity. We intend to introduce new products and product enhancements, which will require that we rapidly achieve adequate production volumes by effectively coordinating with our suppliers and contract manufacturers. The inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products or the loss of any of our contract manufacturers would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill customer orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would harm our revenues, results of operations, competitive position and reputation. We may not be able to expand our contract manufacturing capacity or our internal testing or quality assurance functions as required to keep up with demand for our products. Any such failure would in turn hinder our growth. If we do not expand these capacities and functions effectively or in a timely manner, we may experience disruptions in product flow which could limit our revenues, adversely affect our competitive position and reputation and result in additional cost, cancellation of orders or both. To the extent that our customers consolidate, they may reduce purchases of our products and demand more favorable terms and conditions from us, which would harm our revenues and profitability Consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold. These merged customers could obtain products from a source other than us or demand more favorable terms and conditions from us, which would harm our revenues and profitability. In addition, our significant customers may merge with or acquire our competitors and discontinue their relationships with us. 26 Table of Contents Our products may contain defects which may cause us to incur significant costs, divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers Our existing products and any new or enhanced products we introduce may contain undetected software or hardware defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. These problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relation problems or loss of customers and reputation, all of which would harm our results of operations. A successful claim against us for an amount exceeding the limit on our product liability insurance policy would force us to use our own resources, to the extent available, to pay the claim, which could result in an increase in our expenses and a reduction of our working capital available for other uses, thereby harming our profitability and capital resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm our results of operations and reputation Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our ability to protect and maintain our proprietary rights to our intellectual property. We currently rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. To date, we have relied primarily on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary processes and know-how. We have patent applications and existing patents in the United States and other jurisdictions. We cannot be certain that any of these applications will be approved or that any such patents, if issued, or our existing patents, will be upheld. We also cannot be certain that our existing patents and any such additional patents, if issued, will be effective in protecting our proprietary technology. We generally enter into assignment of rights and confidentiality agreements with our officers, employees and consultants. We also generally limit access to and distribution of our source code and further limit the disclosure and use of our other proprietary information. However, these measures provide only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may not have signed agreements containing adequate protective provisions in every case, and the contractual provisions that are in place may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances. Any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of one or more competitive advantages, loss of market share and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws afford us only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to deter others from developing similar technologies. Others may attempt to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Further, monitoring the unauthorized use of our products and our proprietary rights is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation. The inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities or the adoption of new tax legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial position We conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those jurisdictions. Due to the complexity of tax laws in those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from tax authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, legislative bodies in the various countries in which we do business may from time to time adopt new tax legislation that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 27 Table of Contents Our investment portfolio may become impaired by further deterioration of the financial markets We follow an established investment policy and set of objectives designed to preserve principal and liquidity, to generate a market return given the policys guidelines and to avoid certain investment concentrations. The policy also sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one non-government issuer. Our cash equivalent and short- and long-term investment portfolio as of December 31, 2009 consisted of money market funds, U.S. government and government agency debt securities, corporate debt securities and auction rate securities. Due to the adverse global economic conditions that continue to impact the financial markets and the specific impacts on our underlying investments, in 2008, we recorded an other-than-tempory impairment charge to earnings of $20.2 million related to our investments in illiquid auction rate securities (ARS) and our investment in bonds issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an additional other-than-temporary impairment charge to earnings of $2.8 million (pre-tax) related to our illiquid ARS. As of December 31, 2009, the estimated fair values of our illiquid ARS approximated $5.7 million. Although the remainder of our investment portfolios carrying value approximated fair value as of December 31, 2009, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, or the future value of our investments. As a result, we can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be further impaired in the future and that any such impairment will not materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in laws, regulations and financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations Changes in accounting regulations and standards, such as increased use of fair value measures and the potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), can have a significant effect on our results. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future as a result of recent Congressional and regulatory actions. New laws, regulations and accounting standards, as well as the questioning of, or changes to, currently accepted accounting practices in the technology industry may adversely affect our financial results, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. Our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has resulted in increased costs and may continue to result in additional costs in the future We are subject to rules and regulations of federal and state regulatory authorities, including The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) and financial market entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. During the past few years, these entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and Nasdaq, have issued new requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements partly in response to laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of substantial management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of SOX and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, has required, and continues to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. 28 Table of Contents If we fail to maintain our relationships with industry experts, our products may lose industry and market recognition and sales could decline Our relationships with industry experts in the field of performance analysis and measurement of networks and network equipment are critical for maintaining our industry credibility and for developing new products and testing methodologies in a timely fashion. These experts have established standard testing methodologies that evaluate new network equipment products and technologies. We provide these experts and their testing labs with our products and engineering assistance to perform tests on these new network equipment products and technologies. These industry experts refer to our products in their publications which has given our products industry recognition. In addition, these labs offer us the opportunity to test our products on the newest network equipment and technologies, thereby assisting us in developing new products that are designed to meet evolving technological needs. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our relationships with industry experts or that our competitors will not maintain similar or superior relationships with industry experts. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with industry experts or if competitors have superior relationships with them, our products may lose industry and market recognition which could harm our reputation and competitive position and cause our sales to decline. Our headquarters, many of our customers and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are located in California where natural disasters have occurred and may occur in the future Currently, our corporate headquarters, many of our customers and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are located in California. California historically has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires and floods, which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property. We and some of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers may not have adequate redundant, multiple site capacity. In the event of a natural disaster, our ability to conduct business could be significantly disrupted, thereby harming our results of operations. Man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results Despite our implementation of network security measures, our network may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruption to the economy and create further uncertainties in the economy. Energy shortages, such as gas or electricity shortages, could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, despite the possible benefits to our shareholders Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Furthermore, some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. 29 Table of Contents These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control despite possible benefits to our shareholders, may discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may harm the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our shareholders.
