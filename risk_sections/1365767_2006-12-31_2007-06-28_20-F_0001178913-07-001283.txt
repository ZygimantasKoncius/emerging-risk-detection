D. Risk Factors Investing in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this annual report, before deciding to invest in our ordinary shares. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. In this case, the trading price of our ordinary shares would likely decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. 2 Risks Relating to Our Business We have a history of losses, may incur future losses and may not achieve profitability. We have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since we commenced operations in 1997 and through 2005. We had net income of $0.6 million in 2006 compared to net losses of $2.4 million in 2005 and $3.3 million in 2004. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain profitability and we may incur losses in the next several years as we expand our sales and marketing activities and continue to invest in research and development. We may incur losses in the future and may not generate sufficient revenues in the future to maintain profitability. We are dependent on our NetEnforcer traffic management system and NetXplorer network management application suite for all of our revenue. Our revenues are currently derived solely from sales of our NetEnforcer traffic management system and NetXplorer network management application suite, and from maintenance and support contracts related to these products. We currently expect that our revenues from these products will continue to account for all or substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, any factor adversely affecting our ability to sell, or the pricing of or demand for, these products would severely harm our ability to generate revenues. We are pursuing a new line of products, which we refer to as our Service Gateway platform. In some cases, the technology for the Service Gateway is untested. There can be no assurance of our ability to introduce commercially the Service Gateway on a timely basis or our ability to derive significant revenues from it. On June 18, 2007, we announced the launch of a Service Gateway platform that will enable broadband providers to build efficient, secure, manageable and profitable intelligent networks that are optimized to deliver Internet-based content and services. The Service Gateway approach combines a powerful DPI engine and array of services into a fully integrated, carrier-class platform. Within the Service Gateway, value added services leverage the Service GatewayÂ’s DPI and subscriber awareness capabilities, and become more cost-effective by being hosted on an integrated platform. The power of the Service Gateway rests in its ability to identify the traffic flows of individual subscribers and direct them to the value added services to which they have subscribed. We expect initial customer trials of the Service Gateway to begin in the third or the forth quarter 2007. Our ability to deploy the Service Gateway platform may be hampered by technical and operational issues which could delay our ability to derive profitable revenue from this product offering. Additionally, our ability to market this product may prove more difficult than anticipated, including factors such as our ability to competitively price such product. There can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce the Service Gateway on the planned schedule. We cannot ensure that the Service Gateway will perform as expected. 3 We may be unable to compete effectively with other companies in our market who offer, or may in the future offer, competing technologies. We compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive sector of the networking technology market. Our principal competitors are Cisco Systems, Inc. (through its acquisition of P-Cube, Inc.), Sandvine Inc. and Ellacoya Networks, Inc. in the service provider market, including the segment of the largest service providers, referred to as Tier 1 carriers, and Packeteer Inc. in the enterprise market. Our competitors have also identified the potential market opportunity of Tier 1 carriers and we therefore expect intensive competition in this segment in the future. We also compete in particular geographic areas with a number of smaller local competitors and we compete indirectly with router and switch infrastructure companies with features that address some of the problems that our products address. We also face competition from companies that offer partial solutions addressing only one aspect of the challenges facing broadband providers, such as network monitoring or security. Our competitors may announce new products, services or enhancements that better meet the needs of customers or changing industry requirements, or may offer alternative methods to achieve customer objectives. One of our direct competitors, Cisco Systems, is substantially larger than we are and has significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, technical, manufacturing and other resources. The entry of new competitors into our market and acquisitions of our existing competitors by companies with significant resources and established relationships with our potential customers could result in increased competition and harm our business. Increased competition may cause price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations. The market for our products in the service provider market is still emerging and our growth may be harmed if carriers do not adopt DPI solutions. The market for DPI technology is still emerging and the majority of our sales to date have been to small and midsize service providers and enterprises. We believe that the Tier 1 carriers, as well as cable and mobile operators, present a significant market opportunity and are an important element of our long term strategy, but they are still in the early stages of evaluating the benefits and applications of DPI technology. Carriers may decide that full visibility into their networks or highly granular control over content based applications is not critical to their business. They may also determine that certain applications, such as VoIP or video, can be adequately prioritized in their networks by using router and switch infrastructure products without the use of DPI technology. They may also, in some instances, face regulatory constraints that could change the characteristics of the markets. Carriers may also seek an embedded DPI solution in capital equipment devices such as routers rather than the stand-alone solution offered by us. Furthermore, widespread adoption of our products by carriers will require that they migrate to a new business model based on offering subscriber and application-based tiered services and market these new services successfully to consumers. If carriers decide not to adopt DPI technology, our market opportunity would be reduced and our growth rate may be harmed. 4 Demand for our products depends in part on the rate of adoption of bandwidth-intensive broadband applications, such as peer-to-peer (P2P), and latency-sensitive applications, such as voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP), Internet video and online video gaming applications. Our products are used by service providers and enterprises to monitor and manage bandwidth-intensive applications that cause congestion in broadband networks and impact the quality of experience of users. In addition to the general increase in applications delivered over broadband networks that require large amounts of bandwidth, such as P2P applications, demand for our products is driven particularly by the growth in applications which are highly sensitive to network delays and therefore require efficient network management. These applications include VoIP, Internet video and online video gaming applications. If the rapid growth in adoption of VoIP and in the popularity of Internet video and online video gaming applications does not continue, the demand for our products may not grow as anticipated. We depend on third parties to market, sell, install, and provide initial technical support for our products. We market and sell our products to end-customers through third party channel partners, such as distributors, resellers, OEMs and system integrators. Our channel partners are also responsible for installing our products and providing initial customer support for them. As a result, we depend on the ability of our channel partners to market and sell our products successfully to end-customers. If any significant channel partners fail, individually or in the aggregate, to perform as we expect, our sales may suffer. For example, our revenues in the first quarter 2007 were lower than anticipated as a result of certain of our channel partners failing to perform as we had expected with respect to sales in education, enterprise and smaller internet service provider segments. We also depend on our ability to maintain our relationships with existing channel partners and develop relationships in key markets with new channel partners. We cannot assure you that our channel partners will market our products effectively, receive and fulfill customer orders of our products on a timely basis or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing and technical support. In addition, any failure by our channel partners to provide adequate initial support to end-customers could result in customer dissatisfaction with us or our products, which could result in a loss of customers, harm our reputation and delay or limit market acceptance of our products. Our products are complex and it takes time for a new channel partner to gain experience in their operation and installation. Therefore, it may take a period of time before a new channel partner can successfully market, sell and support our products if an existing channel partner ceases to sell our products. Our agreements with channel partners are generally not exclusive and our channel partners may market and sell products that compete with our products. Our agreements with our distributors and resellers are usually for an initial one year term and following the expiration of this term, they can be terminated by either party. We can give no assurance that these agreements will not be terminated upon proper notice and any such termination may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. Demand for our products may be impacted by government regulation of the telecommunications industry. Carriers are subject to government regulation in jurisdictions in which we sell our products. For example, there has been a series of draft bills introduced to the U.S. Congress in the first half of 2006 that would prohibit service providers from prioritizing applications from content providers who are prepared to pay for such service. To date, none of these bills has been adopted; however, some of these bills may still be raised for consideration and other jurisdictions in which we operate may adopt similar legislation. Advocates for the legislation claim that collecting premium fees from certain Â“preferredÂ” customers would distort the market for Internet applications in favor of larger and better-funded content providers and would impact end users who purchased broadband access only to experience differing response times in interacting with various content providers. Opponents of the legislation believe that content providers who support bandwidth-intensive applications should be required to pay service providers a premium in order to support further network investments. Demand from carriers for the traffic management and subscriber management features of our products could be adversely affected if regulations prohibit, or limit, service providers from managing traffic on their networks. A decrease in demand for these features could adversely impact sales of our products. 5 Sales of our products to large service providers can involve a lengthy sales cycle, which may impact the timing of our revenues and result in us expending significant resources without making any sales. The length of our sales cycles to large service providers, including carriers and cable and mobile operators, is generally lengthy, as these end-customers undertake significant testing to assess the performance of our products within their networks. As a result, we may invest significant time from initial contact with a large service provider until that end-customer decides to incorporate our products in its network. We may also expend significant resources attempting to persuade large service providers to incorporate our products into their networks without success. Even after deciding to purchase our products, initial network deployment of our products by a large service provider may last up to three years. Carriers, especially in North America, often require that products they purchase meet Network Equipment Building System (NEBS) certification requirements, which relate the reliability of telecommunications equipment. Our NetEnforcer AC-1000, AC-2500 and next generation products are designed to meet NEBS certification requirements, but carriers may not choose to use our systems until we receive the certification. If a competitor succeeds in convincing a large service provider to adopt that competitorÂ’s product, it may be difficult for us to displace the competitor because of the cost, time, effort and perceived risk to network stability involved in changing solutions. As a result we may incur significant expense without generating any sales. Our revenues and business will be harmed if we do not keep pace with changes in broadband applications and with advances in technology. We will need to invest heavily in developing our DPI technology in order to keep pace with rapid changes in applications, increased broadband network speeds and with our competitorsÂ’ efforts to advance their technology. Designers of broadband applications that our products are designed to identify and manage are using increasingly sophisticated methods to avoid detection and management by network operators. Even if our products successfully identify a particular application, it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between different types of traffic belonging to a single application. Accordingly, we face significant challenges in ensuring that we identify new applications as they are introduced without impacting network performance, especially as networks become faster. This challenge is increased as we seek to expand sales of our products in new geographic territories because the applications vary from country to country and region to region. If we fail to address the needs of customers in particular geographic markets and if we fail to develop enhancements to our products in order to keep pace with advances in technology, our business and revenues will be adversely affected. 6 We currently depend on a single subcontractor, R.H. Electronics Ltd., to manufacture and provide hardware warranty support for our NetEnforcer traffic management system and if it experiences delays, disruptions, quality control problems or a loss in capacity, it could materially adversely affect our operating results. We currently depend on a single subcontractor, R.H. Electronics Ltd., to manufacture, assemble, test, package and provide hardware warranty support for all of our NetEnforcer traffic management systems, although we are negotiating with candidates for an additional third-party manufacturer. In addition, our agreement with R.H. Electronics requires it to procure and store key components for the NetEnforcer at its facilities. If R.H. Electronics experiences delays, disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing our products, or if we fail to effectively manage the relationship with R.H. Electronics, shipments of products to our customers may be delayed and our ability to deliver products to customers could be materially adversely affected. Our agreement with R.H. Electronics is automatically renewed annually for additional one-year terms, unless R.H. Electronics elects not to renew by giving us at least ninety days prior notice to the expiration of any such term. Furthermore, R.H. Electronics may terminate our agreement at any time during the term upon one hundred and twenty days prior notice. We expect that it would take approximately six months to transition manufacturing of our products to an alternate manufacturer and our inventory of completed products may not be sufficient for us to continue delivering products to our customers on a timely basis during any such transition. Therefore, the loss of R.H. Electronics would adversely affect our sales and operating results, and harm our reputation. R.H. ElectronicsÂ’ facilities are located in northern Israel and are in range of rockets that were fired during 2006 from Lebanon into Israel. In the event that the facilities of R.H. Electronics are damaged as a result of hostile action, our ability to deliver products to customers could be materially adversely affected. See also Â“Â–Conditions in Israel could adversely affect our business, and Â–Our operations may be disrupted by the obligations of personnel to perform military service.Â” Certain components for our NetEnforcer traffic management systems come from single or limited sources, and we could lose sales if these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements. Certain components used in our NetEnforcer systems are obtained from single or limited sources. Since our NetEnforcer systems have been designed to incorporate these specific components, any change in these components due to an interruption in supply or our inability to obtain such components on a timely basis would require engineering changes to our products before we could incorporate substitute components. Such changes could be costly and result in lost sales. In particular, the central processing unit for our NetEnforcer AC-400 and our NetEnforcer AC-800 is from Intel Corporation and the network processor for our NetEnforcer AC-1000 and our NetEnforcer AC-2500 is from Hifn Inc. If we or our contract manufacturer fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required, our business could be harmed. Our suppliers also sell products to our competitors. Our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of single-source or limited-sourced components, or to develop alternative sources for components or products would harm our ability to maintain and expand our business. 7 The slowdown in capital expenditures by telecommunications service providers in prior years had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Another down turn in technology spending could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A deterioration of economies around the world and economic uncertainty in the telecommunications market began in 2000 and continued through 2003. There was a curtailment of capital investment by telecommunications carriers and service providers as well as by businesses that use our products, referred to as the enterprise market. Recent increased expenditures in the telecommunications industry in general or in the broadband portion of the market in particular may not continue. Since a substantial portion of our operating expenses consist of salaries, we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses in line with any reduction in revenues or may elect not to do so for business reasons. We will need to continue to generate increased revenues and manage our costs to maintain profitability. Any future industry downturn may increase our inventories, decrease our revenues, result in additional pressure on the price of our products and prolong the time until we are paid, all of which would have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and on our cash flow from operations. We use certain Â“open-sourceÂ” software tools that carry the risk of being subject to intellectual property infringement claims, the assertion of which could impair our product development plans, interfere with our ability to support our customers or require us to pay licensing fees. Our NetEnforcer traffic management systems and NetXplorer management application suite contain software from open source code sources. Open source code is software that is accessible, usable and modifiable by anyone, provided that users and modifiers abide by certain licensing requirements. The original developers of the open source code provide no warranties on such code. Our products include, for example, open source code such as the Linux kernel and the GNU/Linux operating system. The Linux kernel and the GNU/Linux operating system have been developed under a license (known as a General Public License, or GPL), which permits them to be liberally copied, modified and distributed. Under certain conditions, the use of some open source code to create derivative code may obligate us to make the resulting derivative code available to others at no cost. The circumstances under which our use of open source code would compel us to offer derivative code at no cost are subject to different interpretations. While we have periodically undertaken reviews of our use of open source code in an effort to avoid situations that would require us to make parts of our core proprietary technology freely available as open source code, we cannot guarantee that such circumstances will not occur or that a court would not conclude that, under a different interpretation of an open source license, certain of our core technology must be made available as open source code. The use of such open source code may also ultimately require us to take remedial action, such as replacing certain code used in our products, paying a royalty to use some open source code, making certain proprietary source code available to others or discontinuing certain products, that may divert resources away from our development efforts. 8 The license under which we licensed the Linux kernel and GNU/Linux operating system, is currently the subject of litigation in the case of The SCO Group, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., pending in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. SCO filed its complaint in 2003. According to the current trial schedule, the parties are briefing certain issues for summary judgment and other issues are already being argued. The trial date was postponed indefinitely. SCO has alleged that certain versions of the Linux kernel and GNU/Linux operating system contributed by IBM contain unauthorized UNIX code or derivative works of UNIX code, which SCO claims it owns. If the court were to rule in SCOÂ’s favor and find, for example, that GNU/Linux-based products, or significant portions of them, may not be liberally copied, modified or distributed, we may have to modify our products and/or seek a license to use the code in question, which may or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the merit of SCOÂ’s allegations, uncertainty concerning SCOÂ’s allegations could adversely affect our products and customer relationships. If we are unable to successfully protect the intellectual property embodied in our technology, our business could be harmed significantly. Know-how relating to networking protocols, building carrier-grade systems and identifying applications is an important aspect of our intellectual property. To protect our know-how, we customarily require our employees, distributors, resellers, software testers and contractors to execute confidentiality agreements or agree to confidentiality undertakings when their relationship with us begins. Typically, our employment contracts also include the following clauses: assignment of intellectual property rights for all inventions developed by employees, non-disclosure of all confidential information, and non-compete clauses for six months following termination of employment. The enforceability of non-compete clauses in Israel is limited. We cannot provide any assurance that the terms of these agreements are being observed and will be observed in the future. Because our product designs and software are stored electronically and thus are highly portable, we attempt to reduce the portability of our designs and software by physically protecting our servers through the use of closed networks, which prevent external access to our servers. We cannot be certain, however, that such protection will adequately deter individuals or groups from wrongful access to our technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult, and some foreign laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the law of the United States. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary information will be sufficient. In addition, to protect our intellectual property, we may become involved in litigation, which could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays, materially disrupt the conduct of our business or adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2006, we had a limited patent portfolio. We had two issued U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent applications. We also have one pending counterpart application outside of the United States, filed pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty. While we plan to protect our intellectual property with, among other things, patent protection, there can be no assurance that: Â— current or future U.S. or foreign patents applications will be approved; Â— our issued patents will protect our intellectual property and not be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged by third parties; Â— we will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key jurisdictions in which we or our competitors operate; Â— the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business; or 9 Â— others will not independently develop similar or competing products or methods or design around any patents that may be issued to us. The failure to obtain patents, inability to obtain patents with claims of a scope necessary to cover our technology, or the invalidation of our patents, may weaken our competitive position and may adversely affect our revenues. We may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties that, regardless of merit, could result in litigation and our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will not receive communications from third parties asserting that our products and other intellectual property infringe, or may infringe their proprietary rights. We are not currently subject to any proceedings for infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights and are not aware of any parties that intend to pursue such claims against us. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could result in litigation, which could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays and materially disrupt the conduct of our business. As a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty-bearing licensing agreements, stop selling our products or re-brand our products. If it appears necessary, we may seek to license intellectual property that we are alleged to infringe. Such licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Litigation is inherently uncertain and any adverse decision could result in a loss of our proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses from others and otherwise negatively affect our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology, our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our products are highly technical, and any undetected software or hardware errors in our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our products are complex and are incorporated into broadband networks which are a major source of revenue for service providers and which support critical applications for subscribers and enterprises. Due to the complexity of our products and variations among customersÂ’ network environments, we may not detect product defects until full deployment in our customersÂ’ networks. Regardless of whether warranty coverage exists for a product, we may be required to dedicate significant technical resources to resolve any defects. If we encounter significant product problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of major customers, cancellation of product orders, increased costs, delay in recognizing revenue, and damage to our reputation. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert managementÂ’s attention. In addition, if our business liability insurance is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition could be harmed. 10 We need to increase the functionality of our products and offer additional features in order to maintain or increase our profitability. The market in which we operate is highly competitive and unless we continue to enhance the functionality of our products and add additional features, our competitiveness may be harmed and the average selling prices for our products may decrease over time. Such a decrease would generally result from the introduction by competitors of competing products and from the standardization of DPI technology. To counter this trend, we endeavor to enhance our products by offering higher system speeds, and additional features, such as additional security functions, supporting additional applications and enhanced reporting tools. We may also need to reduce our per unit manufacturing costs at a rate equal to or faster than the rate at which selling prices decline. If we are unable to reduce these costs or to offer increased functionally and features, our profitability may be adversely affected. If we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, we may not be able to timely develop, sell or support our products. Our success depends in large part on the continued contribution of our research and development, sales and marketing and managerial personnel. If our business continues to grow, we will need to hire additional qualified research and development, sales and marketing and managerial personnel to succeed. The process of hiring, training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operation is a lengthy and expensive one. The market for qualified personnel is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills, sales skills and understanding of our products and technology. This is particularly true in Israel, where competition for qualified personnel is intense. Our failure to hire and retain qualified personnel could cause our revenues to decline and impair our ability to meet our research and development and sales objectives. The European Union and China have issued statutes relating to the sale of electrical and electronic equipment, including products sold by us. If our products fail to comply with these statues, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions that could materially adversely affect our business. A directive issued by the European Union, or EU, on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, referred to as the EU RoHS, came into effect on July 1, 2006. The EU RoHS directive, lists a number of substances, including lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium, which must either be removed, or reduced to maximum permitted concentrations, in any products containing electrical or electronic components that are sold within the EU. Our products fall within the scope of the EU RoHS directive. In addition, the PeoplesÂ’ Republic of China has enacted a law on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products, referred to as the China RoHS, that is equivalent of the bans implemented in the EU, but the marking and product certification requirements exceed the requirement of the EU RoHS directive. Furthermore, the scope of this legislation is broader than the EU RoHS, covering even medical devices and measurement instruments. We believe that our products are currently compliant with the EU RoHS directive and the China RoHS requirements. There can, however, be no assurance that we will continue to comply with the EU RoHS directive, the China RoHS or any similar directives in other jurisdictions in the future. 11 In 2003, the EU approved a directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, or WEEE, which promotes waste recovery with a view to reducing the quantity of waste for disposal and saving natural resources, in particular by reuse, recycling, composting and recovering energy from waste. The WEEE directive covers all electrical and electronic equipment used by consumers and electronic equipment intended for professional use. The directive, which went into effect in August 2005, requires that all new electrical and electronic equipment placed for sale in the EU be appropriately labeled regarding waste disposal and contains other obligations regarding the collection and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment. Our products fall within the scope of the WEEE directive, with which we believe we are compliant and are taking all requisite steps to ensure continued compliance. The countries of the EU and the PeoplesÂ’ Republic of China form the large markets for our products. If our products fail to comply with WEEE, RoHS directive or the China RoHS, we could be subject to heavy penalties and other sanctions that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our international operations expose us to the risk of fluctuation in currency exchange rates. In 2006, we derived our revenues principally in U.S. dollars and to a lesser extent in euros and shekels. Although a majority of our expenses were denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our expenses were denominated in shekels and to a lesser extent in euros and yen. Our shekel-denominated expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses. We anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in shekels. If the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against the shekel, there will be a negative impact on our profit margins. We currently do not hedge our currency exposure through financial instruments. In addition, if we wish to maintain the dollar-denominated value of our products in non-U.S. markets, devaluation in the local currencies of our customers relative to the U.S. dollar could cause our customers to cancel or decrease orders or default on payment. See Â“ITEM 11: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.Â” We may expand our business or enhance our technology through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses. This could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition. Part of our strategy is to selectively pursue partnerships and acquisitions that provide us access to complementary technologies and accelerate our penetration into new markets. For example, in 2002 we acquired the assets of NetReality, an Israeli manufacturer of traffic management solutions, which increased our customers base and enhanced our engineering capabilities and technology. The negotiation of acquisitions, investments or joint ventures, as well as the integration of acquired or jointly developed businesses or technologies, could divert our managementÂ’s time and resources. Acquired businesses, technologies or joint ventures may not be successfully integrated with our products and operations. We may not realize the intended benefits of any acquisition, investment or joint venture and we may incur future losses from any acquisition, investment or joint venture. In addition, acquisitions could result in: Â— substantial cash expenditures; Â— potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities; 12 Â— the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; Â— a decrease in our profit margins; Â— amortization of intangibles and potential impairment of goodwill; and Â— write-offs of in-process research and development. If acquisitions disrupt our operations, our business may suffer. Under current U.S. and Israeli law, we may not be able to enforce employeesÂ’ covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our former employees. It is our practice to have our employees sign appropriate non-compete agreements. These agreements prohibit our employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. Under current U.S. and Israeli law, we may be unable to enforce these agreements and it may be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from gaining the expertise our former employees gained while working for us. We have not yet evaluated our internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are required to comply with the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by no later than the end of our 2007 fiscal year. We are in the process of determining whether our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems are compliant with Section 404. This process may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. If it is determined that we are not in compliance with Section 404, we may be required to implement new internal control procedures and reevaluate our financial reporting. We may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses as well as higher independent auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. Further, we may need to hire additional qualified personnel in order for us to comply with Section 404. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in our being unable to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our independent auditors. Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares The share price of our ordinary shares has been and may continue to be volatile. Our quarterly financial performance is likely to vary in the future, and may not meet our guidance or the expectations of analysts or investors, which may lead to additional volatility in our share price. The market price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including: Â— announcements or introductions of technological innovations or new products, or product enhancements or pricing policies by us or our competitors; 13 Â— disputes or other developments with respect to our or our competitors' intellectual property rights; Â— announcements of strategic partnerships, joint ventures or other agreements by us or our competitors; Â— recruitment or departure of key personnel; Â— regulatory developments in the markets in which we sell our product; Â— our sale of ordinary shares or other securities in the future; Â— changes in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets; and Â— market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole. Share price fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our ordinary shares is too low. The lack of a trading market may result in the loss of research coverage by securities analysts. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any securities analysts will initiate or maintain research coverage of our company and our ordinary shares. If our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our ordinary shares would likely decline. Securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility. In April 2007, we announced that our revenue and earnings estimates for the first quarter of 2007 and the 2007 fiscal year would be lower than previously projected. The closing price of our ordinary shares on the date following the announcement was $2.04, or 22%, lower than the closing price on the previous day. Subsequently, in May and June 2007, we and certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in a number of purported securities class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuits allege that we failed to disclose in the registration statement for our initial public offering that at the time of the initial public offering we were experiencing declining sales Â“in our indirect distribution channels, such as enterprise, education and smaller ISP customers, in North America,Â” and on that basis the complaints assert violations of U.S. federal securities laws. We believe that the allegations made in the complaints are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. Defending securities class action litigation requires extensive management attention and resources, and an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Defending the purported securities class action lawsuits to which we are subject could be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, and could require extensive management attention and resources, regardless of the merit of these lawsuits. Moreover, we cannot predict the results of legal proceedings, and an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits as a result of a settlement, or a court decision, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 14 A small number of significant beneficial owners of our shares acting together will have a controlling influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, which could delay or prevent a change of control. The largest beneficial owners of our shares, entities and individuals affiliated with Tamir Fishman Ventures, the Gemini Group, Genesis Partners, the Brookside Capital Fund, the Partech International Group and Odem Rotem Holdings Ltd., a company owned and controlled by our Chairman, Yigal Jacoby, each of which beneficially owns as of June 1, 2007 more than 5.0% of our outstanding shares, beneficially own in the aggregate 58.6% of our ordinary shares. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, could exercise a controlling influence over our operations and business strategy and will have sufficient voting power to control the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval. These matters may include: Â— the composition of our board of directors which has the authority to direct our business and to appoint and remove our officers; Â— approving or rejecting a merger, consolidation or other business combination; Â— raising future capital; and Â— amending our articles of association which govern the rights attached to our ordinary shares. This concentration of ownership of our ordinary shares could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open-market purchase programs or other purchases of our ordinary shares that might otherwise give you the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our ordinary shares. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our share price. Future sales of our ordinary shares in the public market and low trading volume could adversely affect our share price. As of December 31, 2006, we had 20,985,811 ordinary shares outstanding. Approximately 65% of these shares are Â“restricted securitiesÂ” available for resale on the Nasdaq Global Market subject, however, to volume limitations under Rule 144. Most of these restricted securities are held by the largest beneficial owners of our shares. Future sales of these restricted shares, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. We have experienced a low trading volume of our ordinary shares since our initial public offering and if one or a small number of parties buys or sells a large number of our ordinary shares, we may experience volatility in our share price and the price and liquidity of our shares may be adversely affected. 15 Our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a Passive Foreign Investment Company. Generally, if for any taxable year 75% or more of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of our assets are held for the production of, or produce, passive income, we would be characterized as a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To determine if at least 50% of our assets are held for the production of, or produce, passive income we may use the market capitalization method for certain periods. Under the market capitalization method, the total asset value of the Company would be considered to equal the fair market value of its outstanding shares plus outstanding indebtedness on a relevant testing date. Because the market price of our ordinary shares is likely to fluctuate and the market price of the shares of technology companies has historically been especially volatile, and because the market price may affect the determination of whether we will be considered a passive foreign investment company, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year. See Â“ITEM 10: Additional InformationÂ–TaxationÂ–Taxation of our Shareholders.Â” Risks Relating to our Location in Israel Conditions in Israel could adversely affect our business. We are incorporated under Israeli law and our principal offices, and research and development facilities are located in Israel. In addition, the subcontractor for our products is located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our business. Since the State of Israel was established in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, there has been an increase in unrest and terrorist activity, which began in September 2000 and has continued with varying levels of severity ever since. In July and August 2006, a war was fought between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, including rockets being fired from Lebanon up to 50 miles into Israel. Furthermore, several countries, principally in the Middle East, still restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies if hostilities in Israel continue or increase. These restrictions may limit materially our ability to sell our solutions to companies in these countries. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, could adversely affect our operations and product development, cause our revenues to decrease and adversely affect the share price of publicly traded companies having operations in Israel, such as us. Additionally, any hostilities involving Israel may have a material adverse effect on R.H. Electronics and its facilities in which event, all or a portion of our inventory may be damaged, and our ability to deliver products to customers may be materially adversely affected. Our operations may be disrupted by the obligations of personnel to perform military service. As of June 1, 2007, we had 246 employees of whom 179 were based in Israel. Our employees in Israel, including some officers, may be called upon to perform up to one month (in some cases more) of annual military reserve duty until they reach age 45 and, in emergency circumstances, could be called to active duty. In response to increased tension and hostilities, there have been since September 2000 occasional call-ups of military reservists, including in connection with the recent war in Lebanon, and it is possible that there will be additional call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of our employees related to military service or the absence for extended periods of one or more of our key employees for military service. Such disruption could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the absence of a significant number of the employees of R.H. Electronics related to military service or the absence for extended periods of one or more of R.H. ElectronicsÂ’ key employees for military service may disrupt its operations in which event our ability to deliver products to customers may be materially adversely affected. 16 The tax benefits that are available to us require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs and taxes. Our investment program in equipment at our facility in Hod-Hasharon, Israel has been granted approved enterprise status and we are therefore eligible for tax benefits under the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, referred to as the Investment Law. We expect to utilize these tax benefits after we utilize our net operating loss carry forwards. As of December 31, 2006, our net operating loss carry forwards for Israeli tax purposes amounted to approximately $20 million. To remain eligible for these tax benefits, we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations and the criteria set forth in the specific certificate of approval, including, among other conditions, that the approved enterprise be operated over a seven-year period and that at least 30% of our investment in fixed assets of the approved enterprise be funded by additional paid-up ordinary share capital. If we do not meet the conditions stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations and the criteria set forth in the specific certificate of approval in the future, the tax benefits would be canceled and we could be required to refund any tax benefits that we have received. These tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level. Effective April 1, 2005, the Investment Law was amended. As a result, the criteria for new investments qualified to receive tax benefits were revised. No assurance can be given that we will, in the future, be eligible to receive additional tax benefits under this law. The termination or reduction of these tax benefits would increase our tax liability in the future, which would reduce our profits or increase our losses. Additionally, if we increase our activities outside of Israel, for example, by future acquisitions, our increased activities might not be eligible for inclusion in Israeli tax benefit programs. See Â“ITEM 10: Additional InformationÂ–TaxationÂ–Israeli Tax Considerations and Government ProgramsÂ–Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959.Â” The government grants we have received for research and development expenditures restrict our ability to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel and require us to satisfy specified conditions. If we fail to comply with such restrictions or these conditions, we may be required to refund grants previously received together with interest and penalties, and may be subject to criminal charges. We have received royalty-bearing grants from the government of Israel through the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor, for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures in Israel, pursuant to the provisions of The Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development Law, 1984, referred to as the Research and Development Law. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, we received and accrued grants totaling $894, $727 and $1,811 million from the Office of the Chief Scientist, representing 18.4%, 10.9% and 19.4%, respectively, of our gross research and development expenditures in these periods. We may not receive future grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist and our failure to receive additional grants in the future could adversely affect our profitability. 17 The terms of the grants prohibit us from manufacturing products outside of Israel or transferring intellectual property rights in technologies developed using these grants inside or outside of Israel without special approvals. Even if we receive approval to manufacture our products outside of Israel, we may be required to pay an increased total amount of royalties, which may be up to 300% of the grant amount plus interest, depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside of Israel. This restriction may impair our ability to outsource manufacturing or engage in similar arrangements for those products or technologies. Know-how developed under an approved research and development program may not be transferred to any third parties, except in certain circumstances and subject to prior approval. In addition, if we fail to comply with any of the conditions and restrictions imposed by the Research and Development Law or by the specific terms of under which we received the grants, we may be required to refund any grants previously received together with interest and penalties, and may be subject to criminal charges. In recent years, the government of Israel has accelerated the rate of repayment of the Office of Chief Scientist grants and may further accelerate them in the future. It may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us, our officers and directors in Israel or the United States, or to assert U.S. securities laws claims in Israel or serve process on our officers and directors. We are incorporated in Israel. The majority of our executive officers and directors are not residents of the United States, and the majority of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to enforce a U.S. court judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us or any of these persons in a U.S. or Israeli court, or to effect service of process upon these persons in the United States. Additionally, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws on the grounds that Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. Even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel addressing the matters described above. Provisions of Israeli law and our articles of association may delay, prevent or make undesirable an acquisition of all or a significant portion of our shares or assets. Our articles of association contain certain provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control, including a classified board of directors. In addition, Israeli corporate law regulates acquisitions of shares through tender offers and mergers, requires special approvals for transactions involving significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions. These provisions of Israeli law could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders, and may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for our ordinary shares. Furthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions undesirable to us or to some of our shareholders.
