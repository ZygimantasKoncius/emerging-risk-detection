Risk Factors We generally hedge our foreign exchange exposure, but do not cover translation risk relating to our foreign subsidiaries. Movements in exchange rates of the Euro relative to other currencies (in particular the Brazilian Real and Argentine Peso) may adversely affect our consolidated results. In particular, with respect to Argentina, we currently utilize for all purposes the official exchange rate of the Argentine Peso because it is the exchange rate that Telecom Argentina accesses for making payment to foreign creditors and for collections from foreign operators. The increasing restrictions in the exchange rates market increased the gap between the official Peso exchange rate and the implicit exchange rate, reached through the valuation of securities trading in the local market in pesos and the same ones trading in an external market in another currency. Given the economic and political conditions in Argentina, we cannot predict whether, and to what extent, the value of the peso may depreciate against the U.S. dollar, the Euro or other foreign currencies, in such a form that it will capture partially or totally the current gap between the official exchange rate and the implicit exchange rate. A rise in the value of the Euro relative to other currencies in certain countries in which we operate or have made investments will reduce the relative value of the revenues or assets of our operations in those countries and, therefore, may adversely affect our operating results or financial position. In addition, we have raised, and may raise in an increasing proportion in the future, financing in currencies other than the Euro, principally the U.S. dollar and British pound. In accordance with our risk management policies, we generally hedge the foreign currency risk exposure related to non-Euro denominated liabilities, through cross-currency and interest rate swaps. Furthermore, we enter into derivative transactions hedging our interest rate exposure to change interest rates in order to manage the volatility of our income statement, while remaining within predefined target levels. However, no assurance can be given that fluctuations in interest rates will not adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, an increase of sovereign spreads, and of the default risk it reflects, in the countries where we operate, may affect the value of our assets in such countries. 18 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Exchange Rates 3.2 EXCHANGE RATES We publish our consolidated financial statements in euros. References to , euro and Euro are to the euro, the single unified currency that was introduced in Italy and 10 other member states of the EU on January 1, 1999. References to U.S. dollars, dollars, U.S.$ or $ are to U.S. dollars, the currency of the United States of America.

The Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares of Telecom Italia trade on Mercato Telematico Azionario (Telematico), managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (Borsa Italiana) in euro. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar will affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of the euro price of the Ordinary Shares and the Savings Shares and the price of the Ordinary Share American Depositary Shares (Ordinary Share ADSs) and the Savings Share American Depositary Shares (Savings Share ADSs), on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Cash dividends are paid in euro. Exchange rate fluctuations will affect the U.S. dollar amounts received by owners of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs upon conversion by the Depositary of cash dividends paid in euro on the underlying Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares.

Key Information Selected Financial And Statistical Information 3.3 SELECTED FINANCIAL AND STATISTICAL INFORMATION The selected financial data set forth below is consolidated financial data of the Telecom Italia Group as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008, which have been extracted or derived, with the exception of amounts presented in U.S. dollars, financial ratios and statistical data, from the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Telecom Italia Group prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by IASB and which have been audited, with respect to 2012, 2011 and 2010, by the independent auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A., which replaced Reconta Ernst & Young S.p.A., as part of the normal required rotation of auditors. 2009 and 2008 were audited by the independent auditor Reconta Ernst & Young S.p.A. In 2012, the Group applied the accounting policies on a basis consistent with those of the previous years, except for: · the early adoption, starting from the first half of 2012, of the revised version of IAS 19 (Employee Benefits), whose effects are described in NoteAccounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The early adoption of such amendments resulted in the restatement of the 2011 and 2010 separate consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of comprehensive income; · the new standards and interpretations adopted by the Group since January 1, 2012 (IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IFRS 7 (DisclosuresTransfers of Financial Assets)), that did not have any effect on the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2012. 20 Table of Contents Item 3.

The adoption of IAS 19 does not have any effect on the Groups statement of financial position other than certain reclassifications under Equity. Further details and the effects on the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are provided in the NoteAccounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 2009 and 2008 data has not been restated for the adoption of IAS 19 as the company considered the impact immaterial. (1) For the convenience of the reader, Euro amounts for 2012 have been converted into U.S. dollars using the Euro/Dollar Exchange Rate in effect on December 31, 2012, of 1.00 =1.3186 U.S.$. 22 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Selected Financial And Statistical Information (2) For the purposes of IFRS, Parent, as used in this Annual Report, means Telecom Italia S.p.A. (3) Due to the loss in 2012 and in 2011, the ratio coverage was less than 1:1. The company would have needed to generate additional earnings of 38 million euros in 2012 and 2,704 million euros in 2011 to achieve a coverage of 1:1. For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges: · Earnings is calculated by adding:  profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations;  fixed charges (as defined below);  amortization of capitalized interest and debt issue discounts or premiums;  dividends from associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method; and  share of losses of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method and then subtracting:  capitalized interest for the applicable period; and  share of earnings of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. · Fixed charges is calculated by adding:  interest expenses (both expensed and capitalized);  issue costs and any original debt issue discounts or premiums; and  an estimate of the interest within rental expense for operating leases. (4) In accordance with IAS 33 (Earnings per share), basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the Groups profit (loss) available to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury shares. Since Telecom Italia has both Ordinary and Savings Shares outstanding, the calculations also take into account the requirement that holders of Savings Shares are entitled to an additional dividend equal to 2% of the par value of shares above dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares. For the purpose of these calculations, the weighted average number of:  Ordinary Shares was 13,277,621,082 for the year ended December 31, 2012, was 13,264,375,078 for the year ended December 31, 2011, 13,239,883,276 for the year ended December 31, 2010, 13,220,792,908 for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 13,246,643,947 for the year ended December 31, 2008;  Savings Shares was 6,026,120,661 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008. For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted assuming conversion of all dilutive potential shares. Potential shares are those securities that, if converted into shares, would increase the total number of shares outstanding and reduce the earnings attributable to each share. Potential shares include options, warrants and convertible securities. The Groups profit (loss) is also adjusted to reflect the impact of the conversion of potential shares net of the related tax effects. (5) Subject to approval, at the Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on April 17, 2013, Telecom Italias dividend coupons for the year ended December 31, 2012, will be clipped on April 22, 2013, and will be payable from April 25, 2013. (6) Share capital represents share capital issued net of the par value of treasury shares. (7) Net Financial Debt is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act. For further details please see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects5.2 Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 20125.2.3 Non-GAAP Financial Measures. (8) Physical accesses include Broadband accesses. 23 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends 3.4 DIVIDENDS The determination of our future dividend policy, and the amounts thereof, will depend upon a number of factors, including but not limited to our earnings, financial condition and cash requirements, prospects and such other factors as may be deemed relevant at the time. As part of our 2013-2015 Plan, we announced our intention to reduce our annual dividend beginning in 2012 in order to bring it into line with our strategic priority of continuing to deleverage and reduce our net financial debt. See Item 4Information on the Telecom Italia Group4.1.7 Updated Strategy. The following table sets forth the dividends per Ordinary Share and per Savings Share declared by Telecom Italia with respect to each of the last five fiscal years and the aggregate dividends paid in such years. Actual dividends paid are rounded to the nearest whole cent.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, Euro amounts have been translated into U.S. dollars using the Noon Buying Rate in effect on April 5, 2013. (2) Subject to approval at the Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on April 17, 2013. Pursuant to Italian Stock Exchange rules, dividends on the Ordinary Shares and the Savings Shares are payable from the fourth trading day after the third Friday of each month, and in any case, at least four business days after the Shareholders Annual Meeting approving the dividends. Telecom Italias dividend coupons for the year ended December 31, 2012, will be clipped on April 22, 2013, and will be payable from April 25, 2013. Payment of annual dividends is subject to approval by the holders of Ordinary Shares at the annual general shareholders meeting, which must be held within 180 days after the end of the financial year to which it relates (pursuant to article 18, second paragraph, of the Companys Bylaws). In addition, Article 21 of the Companys Bylaws gives the Board of Directors the power to approve the distribution of interim dividends. Pursuant to Italian law, the distribution may be approved after the final approval of the preceding years financial statements, and the interim dividends may not exceed the lower of (i) the difference between profits from the preceding fiscal year and amounts required to be attributed to legal and statutory reserves and (ii) available reserves. Once paid in compliance with applicable laws, shareholders cannot be required to repay interim dividends to the Company if the shareholders collected such dividends in good faith. Dividends not collected within five years from the date they become payable will be forfeited in favor of the Company. If profits are not fully distributed, additional reserves are created. According to the Italian Civil Code, before dividends may be paid with respect to any year, an amount equal to 5% of the profit of the Company for such year must be set aside to the legal reserve until the legal reserve, including amounts set aside during prior years, is at least equal to one-fifth of the par value of the Companys issued share capital. This legal reserve is not available for payment of dividends. Such restriction on the payment of dividends applies, on a non-consolidated basis, to each Italian subsidiary of the Telecom Italia Group. The Company may also pay dividends out of available retained earnings from prior years or other reserves. Dividends in respect of Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares held with Monte Titoli S.p.A. (Monte Titoli) are automatically credited to the accounts of the beneficial owners with the relevant participant of Monte Titoli, without the need for presentation by such beneficial owners of any documentation. See Item 10. Additional Information10.4 Description of Capital Stock. Arrangements between Euroclear or Clearstream and Monte Titoli permit the shareholders to collect the dividends through Euroclear or Clearstream. Holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are entitled to receive payments in respect of dividends on the underlying Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, in accordance with the relevant Deposit Agreement. 24 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends Dividends payable on the Companys Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares may be subject to deduction of Italian withholding tax. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. Italian regulations do not contain any specific restrictions on the payment of dividends to non-residents of Italy. See Item 10. Additional Information10.2 Exchange Controls and Other Limitations Affecting Security Holders. Pursuant to Italian law, in connection with the payment of dividends, participants of Monte Titoli are required to supply to the Italian tax authorities certain information concerning the identity of non-resident shareholders holding Ordinary Shares or Savings Shares. Shareholders are required to provide their Italian tax identification number, if any, or alternatively, in the case of legal entities, their name, country of establishment and address, or in the case of individuals, their name, address and place and date of birth, or in the case of partnerships, the information required for legal entities and the information required for individuals with respect to one of their representatives. In the case of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs owned by non-residents in Italy, Telecom Italia understands that the provision of information concerning the Depositary, in its capacity as holder of record of the Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, will satisfy these requirements. The Depositary, in accordance with instructions from Telecom Italia, will provide information to beneficial owners of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs, that are considered U.S. residents for purposes of applicable law. To the extent such owners wish to benefit from reduced withholding tax rates on dividends under an income tax treaty, claims for such benefits must be accompanied by the required information. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. 25 Table of Contents
