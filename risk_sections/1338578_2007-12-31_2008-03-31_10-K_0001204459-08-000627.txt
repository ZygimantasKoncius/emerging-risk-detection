ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below, which constitute the material risks facing us. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. You should also refer to the other information about us contained in this Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Approximately 51.96% of our sales revenues were derived from our ten largest customers, and any reduction in revenues from any of these customers would reduce our revenues and net income. While we have over 165 active customers, approximately 51.96% of our sales revenue came from our top ten customers in fiscal year 2007, with Rizhao Steel Co., Ltd. alone accounting for approximately 16.1% of our sales revenue. If we cease to do business at or above current levels with Rizhao Steel Co., Ltd. or any one of our other largest customers which contribute significantly to our sales revenues, and we are unable to generate additional sales revenues with new and existing customers that purchase a similar amount of our products, then our revenues and net income would decline considerably. Our inability to overcome fierce competition in the highly fragmented and highly competitive Chinese refractory market could reduce our revenue and net income. The refractory market in China is highly fragmented with over 1,500 producers of refractory products, according to the Chairman of the Association of China Refractory Industry. Our competitors manufacture products that are similar to and directly compete with the products that we manufacture and market. We compete with many other refractory manufacturers in China, on a region-by-region basis, and with international competitors on a world wide basis. Our main competitors are located in China and include Puyang Refractories Co., Ltd., Wuhan Ruisheng Specialty Refractory Materials Co., Ltd., and Beijing Lier Refractories Co., Ltd. and others. Currently, our primary international competitor is Mineral Technologies, Inc. in the United States. As a market leader in the monolithic refractory marketplace, we can buy raw materials in large quantities allowing us to negotiate volume pricing resulting in lower than our smaller competitors pay for their raw materials. As our smaller competitors consolidate and grow larger, they may able to negotiate similar volume pricing from raw material suppliers. Under that scenario, any cost advantage that we currently enjoy may be reduced or eliminated altogether. Although our smaller competitors may pay higher materials costs relative to our material costs, their operating and administrative costs may be lower than ours, which may allow our competitors to quote very competitive prices for their products and services. Their competitive prices may force us to lower our prices and to sell products and services at a loss in order to maintain our market share. Currently, we have a policy for setting a pricing floor so that we do not sell products at a loss; however, we cannot assure you that we can maintain this policy indefinitely. Thus, increased competition in our industry could reduce our revenue and net income. A downturn or negative changes in the highly volatile steel and iron industry will harm our business and profitability. According to industry association statistics published by the Luoyang Institute in 2002, the iron and steel industries accounted for approximately 60% of consumption in the Chinese refractory industry. Because our largest customers are in the steel industry, our business performance is closely tied to the performance of the steel industry. The sector as a whole is cyclical and its profitability can be volatile as a result of general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rates. These macroeconomic factors have historically resulted in wide fluctuations in the Chinese and the global economies in which steel companies sell their products. In our case, future economic downturns, stagnant economies or currency fluctuations in China or globally could decrease the demand for steel produc ts and, could in turn, negatively impact our sales, margins and profitability. 14 Industry growth rate for refractory products may decelerate and may affect our future revenue growth. In China, the production of refractory materials has experienced fast growth in recent years driven largely by growth in Chinas steel production. According to data provided by the Association of China Refractories Industry, total output of refractory products over the past five years grew from 9.81 million tons in 2000 to 22.76 million tons in 2005, representing an annualized growth rate of 18.3%. Total sales grew from RMB 19,300 million to RMB 64,000 million, representing an annualized growth rate of 27.1%. Our industrys growth has been driven by the growth in the Chinese steel industry. According to figures provided by the National Statistics Bureau of China, the Chinese steel output grew from an annual output of 157 million tons in 2001 to 419 million tons in 2006, representing a CAGR of 21.7%. Going forward, how ever, the forecast provided by the China International Capital Corporation suggests that the annual output of steel in China is expected to grow to 651 million tons by 2010, representing a CAGR of 11.6 % over the next four years. If the steel industry experiences such a slowdown, our growth prospects will likewise be curtailed. Additionally, the market for monolithic refractories in China is still in the developmental stage, and successful market penetration of the monolithic refractories depends heavily on two factors. First, successful market penetration depends on technological progress that results in better performance by our customers, new varieties of products that meet our customers future requirements, and more efficient and effective installation and maintenance methods. Second, successful market penetration also depends on our marketing strategy and our ability to execute that strategy while maintaining a high quality of service to our customers. Our future reve nue growthwithout acquisitionsmay maintain growth, but nevertheless, we may not match our past growth rate. Improvements in the quality and lifespan of refractory products may decrease product turnover and our sales revenues. Technological and manufacturing improvements have made refractory products more durable and more efficient. While making products more durable and more efficient is generally a positive development, the increased quality and durability of refractory products could lead to declining consumption and turnover of refractory products, which is usually measured in kilograms consumed per ton of steel produced. According to the Association of China Refractories Industry, in the developed nations, the average refractory consumption per ton of steel produced dropped from 60 kilograms consumed per ton of steel produced in the 1950s to 13 kilograms consumed per ton of steel produced in 2005. In China, the current average consumption rate is approximately 28 kilograms consumed per ton of steel produced. With the growth rate in the steel industry decele rating and with the consumption rate of refractory products per ton of steel produced decreasing, the refractory industrys future growth rate may decelerate. We can increase our prices to offset a decrease in product consumption, but we cannot assure you that price increases will be acceptable to our customers. Our new products are complex and may contain defects that are detected only after their release to our customers, which may cause us to incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales. Our products are highly complex and must operate at high temperatures for a long period of time. Although our new products are tested prior to release, they can only be fully tested when they are used by our customers. Consequently, our customers may discover defects after new products have been released. Although we have test procedures and quality control standards in place designed to minimize the number of defects in our products, we cannot guarantee that our new products will be completely free of defects when released. If we are unable to quickly and successfully correct the defects identified after their release, we could experience significant costs associated with compensating our customers for damages cause by our products, costs associated with correcting the defects, costs associated with design modifications, and costs a ssociated with service or warranty claims or both. Additionally, we could lose customers, lose market share, and suffer damage to our reputation. The principal raw materials used in our refractory products are several forms of the minerals SiO2, Al203, and MgO, including bauxite, mullite, corundum, processed Al203, Spinel, magnesia, calcium aluminate cement, and silica. We primarily use bauxite in the production of refractory materials, fracture proppants and some industrial ceramic products. The availability of these raw materials and energy resources may decrease and their prices can become volatile as a result of, among other things, changes in overall supply and demand levels and new laws or regulations. Our ability to achieve our sales target depends on our ability to maintain what we believe to be adequate inventories of raw materials to meet reasonably anticipated orders from our customers. In 2007, raw material cos ts accounted for 81.8% of the production cost for refractory products and 75.05% for industrial ceramics products. Our production facilities are located in Gongyi, Henan Province, where there is currently an abundant reserve of bauxite and corundum for refractory manufacturing. Although our proximity to bauxite allows us to benefit from a relatively short delivery time and lower shipping costs to our production facilities, we may experience supply shortages or price increases or both due to sharp increases in overall industry demand for bauxite. Besides purchasing bauxite from local suppliers, we also purchase bauxite, mullite, magnesia, calcium aluminate cement and other raw materials from suppliers in Shanxi Province, Shandong Province, Liaoning Province and Gansu Province. All these locations are outside of Henan Province. Higher shipping costs will increase our cost of raw materials from these sources and will have a negative impact on our re venues and profitability. 15 Further, if our existing suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver our raw materials requirements in time to meet our production schedules, we may be unable to produce certain products, which could result in a decrease in revenues and profitability and a loss of good will with our customers, and could tarnish our reputation as a reliable supplier in our industry. In the event that our raw material and energy costs increase, we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers in full or at all due to contractual agreements or pricing pressures in the refractory market. Any increase in the prices for raw materials or energy resources could materially increase our costs and therefore lower our earnings and profitability. Actions by the Chinese government could drive up our material costs and could have a negative impact on our profitability. In the past five years, the Chinese government has shut down some outdated mineral mines in China. These shutdowns have decreased the overall supply of raw materials needed to produce refractory products. As a result, the materials costs for our products have increased. If the Chinese government shuts down more mineral mines, we could experience further supply shortages and prices increases that could have a negative impact on our profitability. We may not be able to implement our business plan because we may be unable to both fund the substantial ongoing capital and maintenance expenditures that our operations require and invest in new projects at the same time. Our operations are capital intensive and the nature of our business and our business strategy will require additional substantial working capital investment. We require capital for building new production lines, acquiring new equipment, maintaining the condition of our existing equipment and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and to pursue new market opportunities. We may not be able to fund our capital expenditures from operating cash flow and from the proceeds of borrowings available for capital expenditures under our credit facilities, and we may require additional debt or equity financing. We cannot assure you, however, that this type of financing will be available or, if available, it may result in increased interests expense, increased leverage and decreased income available to fund further expansio n. In addition, future debt financings may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and render us more vulnerable to economic downtowns. If we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be unable to implement our business plan, and our financial performance may be adversely impacted. A significant interruption or casualty loss at any of our facilities could increase our production costs and reduce our sales and earnings. Our manufacturing process requires large industrial facilities for crushing, smashing, batching, molding and baking raw materials. After the refractory products come off the production line, we need additional facilities to inspect, package, and store the finished goods. Our facilities may experience interruptions or major accidents and may be subject to unplanned events such as explosions, fires, inclement weather, acts of God, terrorism, accidents and transportation interruptions. Any shutdown or interruption of any facility would reduce the output from that facility, which could substantially impair our ability to meet sales targets. Interruptions in production capabilities will inevitably increase production costs and reduce our sales and earnings. In addition to the revenue losses, longer-term business disruption could res ult in the loss of goodwill with our customers. To the extent these events are not covered by insurance, our revenues, margins and cash flows may be adversely impacted by events of this type. Environmental regulations impose substantial costs and limitations on our operations. Our products are not considered environmentally hazardous materials, however, the dust produced during our production process is considered hazardous to the environment. We have environmental liability risks and limitations on operations brought about by the requirements of environmental laws and regulations. We are subject to various national and local environmental laws and regulations concerning issues such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid and hazardous waste management and disposal. These laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. While we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, the risks of substantial unanticipated costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business . It is possible that future conditions may develop, arise or be discovered that create new environmental compliance or remediation liabilities and costs. While we believe that we can comply with environmental legislation and regulatory requirements and that the costs of compliance have been included within budgeted cost estimates, compliance may prove to be more limiting and costly than anticipated. If our customers and/or the ultimate consumers of products which use our products successfully assert product liability claims against us due to defects in our products, our operating results may suffer and our reputation may be harmed. Our products are widely used as protective linings in industrial furnaces operating in highly hazardous environments because those furnaces must operate under extremely high temperatures in order to produce iron, steel and other industrial products. Significant property damage, personal injuries and even death can result from the malfunctioning of high temperature furnaces as a result of defects in our refractory products. The costs and resources needed to defend product liability claims could be substantial. If found liable, we could be responsible for paying some or all of the damages. We do not have product liability insurance. The publicity surrounding these sorts of claims is also likely damage our reputation, regardless of whether such claims are successful. Any of these consequences resulting from defects in our pr oducts would hurt our operating results and stockholder value. 16 If we are not able to adequately secure and protect our patent, trademark and other proprietary rights our business may be materially affected. We hold patents for (a) integral casting technology for mixer furnaces (which expires on December 29, 2020), (b) a ceramic pressurizing double flashboard and brake valve (which expires on January 24, 2015), (c) a straight burning gas regeneration kiln (which expires on May 23, 2015) and (d) a pump-used ceramic post stopper (which expires on March 8, 2016). We also rely on non-disclosure agreements and other confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights in various jurisdictions. Although we do not consider any single patent to be of such material importance that its absence would harm or cause a material disruption of our business, when taken together, these technologies are very important to our business and it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer our products, or otherwise obtain an d use information that we regard as proprietary. Furthermore, third parties could challenge the scope or enforceability of our patents. In certain foreign countries, including China where we operate, the laws do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Decided court cases in Chinas civil law system do not have binding legal effect on future decisions and even where adequate law exists in China, enforcement based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic and it may be difficult to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. In addition, the relative inexperience of Chinas judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Any misappropriation of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we cannot assure you that the measures we take to protect our proprietary rights are adequate. Expansion of our business may strain our management and operational infrastructure and impede our ability to meet any increased demand for our products. Our business plan is to significantly grow our operations by meeting the anticipated growth in demand for existing products and by introducing new product offerings. Growth in our business may place a significant strain on our personnel, management, financial systems and other resources. Our business growth also presents numerous risks and challenges, including: • our ability to successfully and rapidly expand sales to potential customers in response to potentially increasing demand; • the costs associated with such growth, which are difficult to quantify, but could be significant; and • the costs associated with developing new products to keep pace with rapid technological changes. To accommodate this growth and compete effectively, we may need to obtain additional funding to improve information systems, procedures and controls and expand, train, motivate and manage existing and additional employees. Funding may not be available in a sufficient amount or on favorable terms, if at all. If we are not able to manage these activities and implement these strategies successfully to expand to meet any increased demand, our operating results could suffer. We depend heavily on key personnel, and turnover of key employees and senior management could harm our business. Our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key technical and senior management personnel. These key personnel include Shunqing Zhang, our President and CEO; Bo Hu, President of ZhengZhou Duesail Fracture Proppant Co. Ltd.; Zhenyong Bi, Manager of Henan Gengsheng; and Hongfeng Jin, our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Interim Corporate Secretary. We have employment contracts with all of these individuals. Although none of our key people are planning to retire or nearing retirement age, if we lose any one of them due to any unforeseeable event or if any one of them should fail to perform in his current position, and if we are not able to find another person with similar skills and experience as a replacement in a timely fashion, our business could suffer. &n bsp;Significant turnover in our senior management also could significantly deplete the institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the manufacturing, technical, marketing and sales aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future. 17 We do not have any independent directors and there is no assurance that any independent directors will be appointed or what their qualifications may be if they are appointed. Currently, we have a single director and no independent directors. In the future, we may appoint a number of independent directors which will constitute a majority of our board of directors before our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, but we may not be able to identify independent directors qualified to be on our board. We may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have those controls attested to by our independent auditors. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the companys internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports, including Form 10-K. We are subject to this requirement commencing with our fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and a report of our management is included under Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, SOX 404 requires the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a companys financial statements to also attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of such companys internal controls over financial reporting, as well as the operating effectiveness of such companys internal controls. However, this annual report does not inclu de an attestation report because under current law, we will not be subject to these requirements until our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. We can provide no assurance that we will comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby. There can be no assurance that we will receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. Our holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends. We have no direct business operations, other than our ownership of our subsidiaries. While we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars. Chinese regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their after tax profits according to Chinese accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds. Currently, our subsidiaries in China are the only sources of revenues or investment holdings for the payment of dividends. If they do not accumulate sufficient profits under Chinese accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by Chinese accounting standards, we will be unable to pay any dividends. We have not earned significant revenues on our new fracture proppant products and we cannot guarantee that we will earn additional revenues on this product line in the future or that it will ultimately be profitable. We first produced fracture proppant products in December 2006. As December 31, 2007, we had earned $0.45 million in revenues from sales of our fracture proppant products. We are expecting to see an increase in our total revenues for the initial sales of fracture proppant products in 2008, but the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the marketing of new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to market additional fracture proppant products in the future, that future revenues from such sales will be significant, that any sales will be profitable or that we will have sufficient funds available to continue the manufacturing and marketing of these products. However, we do not expect our other opera tions to be materially affected by our failure to successfully market our new fracture proppant products. RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA Changes in Chinas political or economic situation could harm us and our operating results. Economic reforms adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of the country, but the government could change these economic reforms or any of the legal systems at any time. This could either benefit or damage our operations and profitability. Some of the things that could have this effect are: 18 • Level of government involvement in the economy; • Control of foreign exchange; • Methods of allocating resources; • Balance of payments position; • International trade restrictions; and • International conflict. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, in many ways. For example, state-owned enterprises still constitute a large portion of the Chinese economy and weak corporate governance and a lack of flexible currency exchange policy still prevail in China. As a result of these differences, we may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy was similar to those of the OECD member countries. Our business is largely subject to the uncertain legal environment in China and your legal protection could be limited. The Chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which precedents set in earlier legal cases are not generally used. The overall effect of legislation enacted over the past 20 years has been to enhance the legal protections afforded to foreign invested enterprises in China. However, these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent and are evolving rapidly, and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to foreign investors, such as the right of foreign invested enterprises to hold licenses and permits such as requisite business licenses. In addition, all of our executive officers and our sole director are residents of China and not of the U.S., and substantial ly all the assets of these persons are located outside the U.S. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process in the U.S., or to enforce a judgment obtained in the U.S. against our Chinese operations and subsidiaries. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. China only recently has permitted provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures. Future inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past ten years, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 20.7% and as low as -2.2%. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products and our company. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues effectively. The majority of our revenues will be settled in Renminbi and U.S. dollars, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in Renminbi to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the Renminbi for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval in China, and compani es are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. We cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi. 19 Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us. In October 2005, the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China, generally referred to as Circular 75, which required PRC residents to register with the competent local SAFE branch before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose company, or SPV, for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of China on the strength of domestic PRC assets originally held by those residents. Internal implementing guidelines issued by SAFE, which became public in June 2007 (known as Notice 106), expanded the reach of Circular 75 by purporting to cover the establishment or acquisition of control by PRC residents of offshore entities which merely acquire  ;control over domestic companies or assets, even in the absence of legal ownership; adding requirements relating to the source of the PRC residents funds used to establish or acquire the offshore entity; covering the use of existing offshore entities for offshore financings; purporting to cover situations in which an offshore SPV establishes a new subsidiary in China or acquires an unrelated company or unrelated assets in China; and making the domestic affiliate of the SPV responsible for the accuracy of certain documents which must be filed in connection with any such registration, notably, the business plan which describes the overseas financing and the use of proceeds. Amendments to registrations made under Circular 75 are required in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, mergers and acquisitions, equity investment or creation of any security interest in any assets located in China to guarantee offshore obligations, and Notice 106 make s the offshore SPV jointly responsible for these filings. In the case of an SPV which was established, and which acquired a related domestic company or assets, before the implementation date of Circular 75, a retroactive SAFE registration was required to have been completed before March 31, 2006; this date was subsequently extended indefinitely by Notice 106, which also required that the Registrant establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the SPV and its affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the requirements of Circular 75, as applied by SAFE in accordance with Notice 106, may result in fines and other penalties under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Any such failure could also result in the SPVs affiliates being impeded or prevented from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, or from engaging in other transfers of fund s into or out of China. We believe our stockholders who are PRC residents as defined in Circular 75 have registered with the relevant branch of SAFE, as currently required, in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries. However, we cannot provide any assurances that their existing registrations have fully complied with, and they have made all necessary amendments to their registration to fully comply with, all applicable registrations or approvals required by Circular 75. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how Circular 75 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such a s the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 75 by our PRC resident beneficial holders. In addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 75. We also have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect stockholders or the outcome of such registration procedures. A failure by our PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident stockholders to comply with Circular 75, if SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. The value of our securities will be affected by the currency exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB. The value of our common stock will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB, and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. For example, if we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for our operational needs and the RMB appreciates against the U.S. dollar at that time, our financial position, our business, and the price of our common stock may be harmed. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of declaring dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB, the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings from our subsidiaries in China would be reduced. Our procurement strategy is to diversify our suppliers both in the PRC and overseas. And some of our raw materials and major equipments are currently imported. These transactions are often settled in U.S. dollars or other foreign currency. In the event that the U.S. dollars or other foreign currency appreciate against RMB, our costs will increase. If we cannot pass the resulted cost increase to our customers, our profitability and operating results will suffer. In addition, because our sales to international customers are growing, we are subject to the risk of foreign currency depreciation. 20 RISKS RELATED TO THE MARKET FOR OUR STOCK Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ system. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. We are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called penny stocks to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our common stock becomes a penny stock, we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and h ave received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock. There can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest. Our President and CEO holds a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities. Shunqing Zhang, our CEO and President is the beneficial owner of approximately 70.25 % of our outstanding voting securities. As a result, he possess significant influence, giving him the ability to elect a majority of our board of directors and to authorize or prevent significant corporate transactions. His ownership and control may impede or delay any future change in control through merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combinations; and may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer. Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation may make it more difficult for a third party to effect a change-in-control. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include voting rights including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights and redemption rights provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of such common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of the board of d irectors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change-in-control, which in turn could prevent the stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 21
