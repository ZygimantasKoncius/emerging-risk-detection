Risk Factors-We have customers that are significant to us and the loss of all or a portion of their business would have an adverse effect on us". The increase in the price of certain of our raw materials, in particular natural gas, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Natural gas prices have increased from an average price of $3.22 during 2002 to an average price of $8.61 during 2005, representing a cumulative increase of 167%. Furthermore, as the price of natural gas has significantly increased in recent years, we have not been able to raise our products' prices to fully reflect those increases, which have adversely affected our results of operations and liquidity. Economic developments in Mexico and the United States affect our business A substantial portion of our operations are in Mexico and a substantial majority of our consolidated net sales are made in Mexico and the United States. Therefore, economic conditions in Mexico and the United States have a significant effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 2005 was a year of moderate global economic growth. The economies of Mexico and the United States-our two biggest markets-recorded actual GDP growth in 2005 of 3.0% and 3.5%, respectively, compared with growth of 4.4% and 4.2%, respectively, in 2004. Mexico's economic growth was mainly driven by the increase in oil prices. Analysts, however, continue to view the pace of growth as weak, largely due to Mexico's lack of progress on structural reforms. Over the past few years, Mexico's rate of inflation has remained low, amounting to 3.3% in 2005. The majority of our manufacturing facilities are located in Mexico. For each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, approximately 43%, 44% and 42%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales resulted from sales to parties located within Mexico. While helping the country to maintain low levels of inflation and a manageable deficit, the Mexican government's continued fiscal and monetary policy does not provide the flexibility necessary to support Mexico's economic improvement. As a result, new investment and growth in aggregate purchasing power have been marginal. Several factors could affect the growth of Mexico's economy and its industrial sector. These factors include the extent of the U.S. economic recovery and the participation of Mexico's industrial sector in that recovery; the Mexican government's approval and implementation of fiscal and other structural reforms such as the evolution of energy prices, particularly natural gas; and the political environment surrounding the presidential elections in July 2006. In spite of these political and economic dynamics, we will continue to focus on the factors within our control and position ourselves to take full advantage of arising market opportunities. Inflation and Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain information relating to inflation and foreign currency exchange rates.

Effects of Inflation and Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations on Operating Margins Changes in the relative value of the peso to the U.S. dollar have an effect on our results of operations. In general, as described more fully in the following paragraphs, a real devaluation of the peso will likely result in an increase of our operating margins and a real appreciation of the peso will likely result in a decrease in our operating margins, in each case, when measured in pesos. This is because the aggregate amount of our consolidated net sales denominated in or affected by U.S. dollars exceeds the aggregate amount of our costs of goods sold and our general, administrative and selling expenses denominated in or affected by U.S. dollars. A substantial portion of the sales generated by our Mexican and U.S. subsidiaries are either denominated in or affected by the value of the U.S. dollar. The prices of a significant number of the products we sell in Mexico, in particular those of flat glass for automotive uses and capital goods are linked to the U.S. dollar. In addition, substantially all of our export sales are invoiced in U.S. dollars and subsequently translated into pesos using the exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. The translated U.S. dollar sales of our Mexican subsidiaries are then restated into constant pesos using INPC, as of the date of the most recent balance sheet included in those financial statements. As a result, when the peso devalues in real terms against the U.S. dollar, as was the case in 2002 and 2003, the same level of U.S. dollar sales as in a prior period will result in higher constant peso revenues in the more recent period. Conversely, when the peso appreciates in real terms against the U.S. dollar, as was the case in 2004 and 2005, the same level of U.S. dollar sales as in a prior period will result in lower constant peso revenues in the more recent period. Moreover, because a material portion of our cost of goods sold, including labor costs, and general, administrative and selling expenses are invoiced in pesos and are not directly affected by the relative value of the peso to the U.S. dollar, the real appreciation or devaluation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar has a significant effect on our operating margins at least in the short term. Further, a strong peso relative to the U.S. dollar makes the Mexican market more attractive for importers and competitors that might not otherwise sell in the Mexican market. A strong peso relative to the U.S. dollar also makes those of our products whose prices are denominated in or are affected by the value of the U.S. dollar less competitive or profitable. When the peso appreciates in real terms, with respect to such products, we must either increase our prices in U.S. dollars, which make our products less price-competitive, or bear reduced operating margins when measured in pesos. Given the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate, in the past we have chosen to reduce our operating margins for such products in response to appreciation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the appreciation of the peso in real terms had an adverse effect on our operating margins and may continue to do so in the future. Sales of products manufactured, processed or sold by us outside Mexico (principally, by Vitro America, Vitro Packaging, Comegua, and Vitro Cristalglass), as well as such subsidiaries' expenses, are restated during a financial reporting period by adjusting such amount for the inflation observed in the country in which the subsidiary operates and then translated into pesos at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Since such subsidiaries' revenues and expenses are generally both earned and incurred in the same currency the devaluation or appreciation of the peso has a much more limited effect on the operating margins of such subsidiaries. However, profits, as reported in real peso terms, are substantially impacted by the devaluation or appreciation of the peso relative to the appropriate currency. Effect of Inflation and Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations on Total Financing Cost Our total financing cost includes (i) net interest expense, (ii) the net effect of inflation on our monetary assets and liabilities, (iii) the net effect of changes in nominal foreign currency exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and (iv) since 2005 due to the implementation of Bulletin C-10, "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities," gains or losses related to hedging transactions. Net interest expense is calculated as the nominal amount of interest expense incurred by us with respect to our short and long-term debt and off-balance sheet financings minus the nominal amount of interest income generated by us with respect to our monetary assets. Inflation affects our total financing cost. During periods of inflation, the principal amount of our monetary debt will generally be reduced in real terms by the rate of inflation. The amount of such reduction will result in a gain from monetary position. This gain is offset by the reduction in real terms in the value of the monetary assets we held during such period. Historically, our monetary liabilities have exceeded our monetary assets and, thus, we have tended to experience monetary gains during periods of inflation. Declining levels of inflation in recent years have resulted in lower monetary gains. Our total financing cost is also impacted by changes in the nominal value of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange gains or losses included in total financing cost result primarily from the impact of nominal changes in the U.S. dollar-peso exchange rate on our and our Mexican subsidiaries' U.S. dollar-denominated monetary liabilities (such as dollar-denominated debt and accounts payable arising from imports of raw materials and equipment) and assets (such as dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable from exports). Because our U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities have historically been significantly in excess of our dollar-denominated monetary assets, the devaluation or appreciation of the peso resulted in exchange losses and gains, respectively. Accordingly, in 2002 and 2003, the nominal devaluation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar resulted in foreign currency exchange losses. The nominal appreciation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar resulted in a foreign currency exchange gain in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, with the unwinding of certain currency exchange swaps in May 2004, we recorded a net exchange loss. Results of Operations On April 3, 2006, the Company announced that it reached an agreement to sell its 51% ownership in Vitrocrisa to the 49% owner Libbey. Vitrocrisa, which was previously presented as one of our reportable segments, under Mexican GAAP is a discontinued operation as of December 31, 2005 as its disposition represents the exit of a significant activity of the Company. Accordingly, all financial and operating information relating to Vitrocrisa in this annual report are presented as a discontinued operation. In addition, the discussion of our indebtedness in this annual report does not include the indebtedness of Vitrocrisa, which is presented under Mexican GAAP on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 as a part of "current liabilities of discontinued operations" and "long-term liabilities of discontinued operations". The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, selected items of our consolidated statement of operations calculated as a percentage of our consolidated net sales.

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Sales Our consolidated net sales increased 0.5% to Ps. 24,150 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from Ps. 24,018 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) significant sales growth in our Glass Containers business unit as a result of greater economic activity in Mexico and overseas, as well as greater acceptance of our new products in the markets we serve, (ii) strong growth in the domestic beer and returnable soft-drink market segments, (iii) an increase in construction-related volumes at Vitro America and (iv) new monumental construction contracts won by Vitro Cristalglass. These increases were partially offset by the decline in sales prices in the construction business line of our Mexican flat glass business due to new competitors in Mexico and the divestitures of Vitro OCF and Vancan, which in 2004 had sales of Ps. 208 million and Ps. 322 million, respectively. Additionally, the appreciation of the peso against the dollar affected our sales, see "Item 5. Operating and financial Review and Prospects-Operating Results-Inflation and Currency exchange fluctuations." For the year ended December 31, 2005, our consolidated export sales were $588 million, an increase of 5% when compared to approximately $562 million for the same period of 2004. The increase in exports mainly came from our wine and liquor bottles, as well as our cosmetic containers. Our export sales represented approximately 27% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. More than 58% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were either denominated in or sensitive to the value of the U.S. dollar. This is due to the fact that, in addition to exports and foreign subsidiaries' sales, the prices of a significant portion of our products in Mexico are generally determined with reference to U.S. dollar-based prices. Flat Glass Business Unit Net sales of our Flat Glass business unit were approximately Ps. 12,276 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 2.7% from Ps. 12,613 million for the same period in 2004. This decrease was mainly driven by our construction glass business line in Mexico which experienced a decline in net sales due to pricing pressures from our competitors and the divestiture of Vitro OCF, which in 2004 had sales of Ps. 201 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our sales of automotive glass due to the launch of successful new OEM platforms during 2005. Export sales of the Flat Glass business unit were approximately $298 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 1.4% when compared to approximately $294 million for the same period in 2004. This increase was largely due to an increased sales volume of automotive business line, especially as it obtained new OEM contracts. Glass Containers Business Unit Net sales of our Glass Containers business unit increased 6.0% to approximately Ps. 11,526 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from approximately Ps. 10,869 million for the same period in 2004. This increase was driven by a 6.9 percent increase in domestic sales, with strong results in the beer and soft drink business lines. Our domestic volumes increased 11.6% in 2005. These increases were partially offset by the divestiture of Vancan, which during 2004 had sales of Ps. 322 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, export sales of the Glass Containers business unit amounted to approximately $290 million, an increase of 9.0% from approximately $266 million for the same period in 2004. Our export volumes increased 4.8% due to an important rise in sales volume from our cosmetics and wine & liquor product lines in the United States. Operating Income Our consolidated operating income increased 11.8% to Ps. 1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from Ps. 1,487 million for the same period in 2004. The increase in operating income was mainly due to our glass containers business' record annual sales. In 2005 we continued to make progress on reducing our corporate overhead and expenses, maintaining strict cost management across all of our businesses. In fact, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales fell by one percentage point year over year. The increase in operating income was partially offset by higher energy costs and the divestitures of Vitro OCF and Vancan which during 2004 had operating income of Ps. 48 million and Ps. 33 million, respectively. Additionally, the appreciation of the peso against the dollar affects our operating income levels. See "Item 5. Operating and financial Review and Prospects-Operating Results-Inflation and Currency exchange fluctuations." Flat Glass Business Unit Operating income of the Flat Glass business unit amounted to Ps. 439 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of 48.7% from Ps. 856 million for the same period in 2004. This decrease was due mainly to the decrease in sales in our construction business, lower sales volumes to the auto glass replacement market as well as higher energy costs and the divestiture of Vitro OCF which during 2004 had operating income of Ps. 48 million. The decrease was partially offset by strong sales to OEM's and increased operating income from our foreign subsidiaries Vitro America, Vitro Cristalglass and Vitro Colombia. Glass Containers Business Unit The operating income of our Glass Containers business unit increased 52% to approximately Ps. 1,227 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from approximately Ps. 807 million for the same period in 2004. This significant increase was driven by higher sales volume, better product mix and improved production efficiency which allowed for favorable fixed-cost absorption. The increase in operating income was partially offset by the divestiture of Vancan which during 2004 had operating income of Ps. 33 million. Total Financing Cost Our total financing cost decreased by Ps. 19 million from approximately Ps. 1,401 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to approximately Ps. 1,382 million for the same period in 2005. This decrease in total financing cost was primarily due to an exchange gain of Ps. 387 million in 2005 compared with an exchange loss in 2004 of Ps. 82 million. In 2005 the Mexican peso experienced a nominal appreciation against the U.S. dollar of 4.6% compared with 0.8% in 2004. The nominal appreciation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a foreign currency exchange gain in 2004, but with the unwinding of certain currency exchange swaps in May 2004, we recorded a net exchange loss. This appreciation mostly impacted our sales prices and income levels. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense which increased from Ps. 1,627 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to Ps. 1,842 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to the increased cost of debt. Income Tax, Tax on Assets and Workers' Profit Sharing Income tax, tax on assets and workers' profit sharing for the year ended December 31, 2005 represented a benefit of Ps. 436 million compared with an expense of Ps. 110 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The primary difference was due to the recognition of a deferred tax benefit of approximately Ps. 585 million resulting from the recognition of the tax basis of intangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries subject to repatriation. Other Expenses, Net Other expenses, net, increased approximately Ps. 262 million to Ps. 400 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from Ps. 138 million for the same period in 2004. During 2005 we continued the downsizing and streamlining of our corporate functions and organization at some of our business units resulting in a charge of Ps. 307 million, and write-off and loss from sale of assets resulting in a non-cash expense of Ps. 351 million. We also recorded a gain of Ps. 424 million, resulting from the designation of Vitro as the sole beneficiary of the Vitro Club assets held in trust. Net Income We recorded net income of Ps. 205 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to a net loss of Ps. 72 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our lower taxes contributed to our improved results while the cumulative effects of the changes in accounting principles for Ps. 114 million decreased our net income. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Sales Our consolidated net sales decreased 0.4% to Ps. 24,018 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from Ps. 24,112 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to our divestiture of our 60% interest in Vitro OCF, which we sold on April 2, 2004, our divestiture of our 50% interest in Vancan, which we sold on September 27, 2004 and our divestiture of our 100% interest in ECSA, which we sold on September 10, 2003 (see "
