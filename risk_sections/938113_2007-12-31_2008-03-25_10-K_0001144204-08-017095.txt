Risk Factors.” Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific factors that may affect us. We may note additional factors elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements. GLOSSARY OF TERMS We report our reserves on two separate standards to meet the requirements for reporting in both Canada and the United States (“U.S.”). Canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”). The definitions given in NI 43-101 are adopted from those given by the Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum. U.S. reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governing by SEC Industry Guide 7. These reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported, but embody differing approaches and definitions. -4- We estimate and report our resources and reserves according to the definitions set forth in NI 43-101 and modify and reconcile them as appropriate to conform to SEC Industry Guide 7 for reporting in the U.S. The definitions for each reporting standard are presented below with supplementary explanation and descriptions of the parallels and differences. NI 43-101 Definitions indicated mineral resource The term “indicated mineral resource” refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be established with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. inferred mineral resource The term “inferred mineral resource” refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. measured mineral resource The term “measured mineral resource” refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. mineral reserve The term “mineral reserve” refers to the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. The study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined. -5- mineral resource The term “mineral resource” refers to a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic material in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. probable mineral reserve The term “probable mineral reserve” refers to the economically mineable part of an indicated, and in some circumstances a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. This study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. proven mineral reserve1 The term “proven mineral reserve” refers to the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. qualified person2 The term “qualified person” refers to an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration, mine development, production activities and project assessment, or any combination thereof, including experience relevant to the subject matter of the project or report and is a member in good standing of a self-regulating organization. SEC Industry Guide 7 Definitions exploration stage An “exploration stage” prospect is one which is not in either the development or production stage. development stage A “development stage” project is one which is undergoing preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for its extraction but which is not yet in production. This stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study. mineralized material3 The term “mineralized material” refers to material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction. probable reserve The term “probable reserve” refers to reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. production stage A “production stage” project is actively engaged in the process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product. -6- proven reserve The term “proven reserve” refers to reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established. reserve The term “reserve” refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction. (“Bankable standards” implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing.) A reserve includes adjustments to the in-situ tonnes and grade to include diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined. 1 For Industry Guide 7 purposes this study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified. 2 Industry Guide 7 does not require designation of a qualified person. 3 This category is substantially equivalent to the combined categories of measured and indicated mineral resources specified in NI 43-101.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW OF APOLLO GOLD The earliest predecessor to Apollo Gold Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario in 1936. In May 2003, it reincorporated under the laws of the Yukon Territory. Apollo Gold Corporation maintains its registered office at 204 Black Street, Suite 300, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada Y1A 2M9, and the telephone number at that office is (867) 668-5252. Apollo Gold Corporation maintains its principal executive office at 5655 S. Yosemite Street, Suite 200, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111-3220, and the telephone number at that office is (720) 886-9656. Our internet address is http://www.apollogold.com. Information contained on our website is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Apollo is engaged in gold mining including extraction, processing, refining and the production of by-product metals, as well as related activities including exploration and development. The Company is the operator of the Montana Tunnels mine (“Mine”), which is a 50% joint venture with Elkhorn Tunnels, LLC (“Elkhorn”). The Mine is an open pit mine and mill producing gold doré and lead-gold and zinc-gold concentrates. See Item 2 “Description of Properties” for further information. Apollo has a development project, the Black Fox Project, which is located near the Township of Matheson in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Apollo also owns Mexican subsidiaries which own concessions at the Huizopa exploration project, located in the Sierra Madres in Chihuahua, Mexico. The Huizopa project is subject to an 80% Apollo/20% Mineras Coronado joint venture agreement. -12- BACKGROUND Apollo Gold Corporation The following chart illustrates Apollo’s operations and principal operating subsidiaries and their jurisdictions of incorporation.

Products The Montana Tunnels mine produces gold, zinc, silver, and lead in gold doré and lead-gold and zinc-gold concentrates. The metals produced are sold to custom smelters, refiners and metals traders. The percentage of sales contributed by each class of product is reflected in the following table. Year Ended December 31, Product Category 2007 2006 2005 Gold 32 % 32 % 46 % Zinc 40 % 47 % 34 % Silver and Lead 28 % 21 % 20 % The table below summarizes Montana Tunnels’ metals production and average metals prices for the periods indicated.

(2) The Mine recommenced milling operations on March 1, 2007; therefore, production in 2007 is for a ten month period. (3) The Montana Tunnels mine ceased milling operations on May 12, 2006; therefore, no metal products were produced after that date for the remainder of 2006. Gold Montana Tunnels produced 16,632, 4,959, and 44,099 ounces of gold during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The majority of our gold revenue is derived from the sale of gold contained within the lead-gold and zinc-gold concentrates. See Item 2 “Description of Properties - Montana Tunnels Mine” for further information. The balance of the gold revenue is derived from the sale of refined gold in the form of doré bars. Because doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals, bars are sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.99% pure gold. Under the terms of our refining contracts, the bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the separately recovered silver is paid to us. -14- Gold Uses Gold has two primary uses: product fabrication and bullion investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors purchase gold bullion, official coins and high-carat jewelry. Gold Supply The worldwide supply of gold consists of a combination of new production from mining and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. Gold Price History The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the value of the US dollar and foreign currencies, global and regional demand, and the political and economic conditions of major gold-producing countries throughout the world. The following table presents the high, low and average afternoon fixing prices for gold per ounce on the London Bullion Market over the past ten years: Year High Low Average 1998 313 273 294 1999 326 253 279 2000 313 264 279 2001 293 256 271 2002 349 278 310 2003 416 320 364 2004 454 375 409 2005 537 411 445 2006 725 525 604 2007 841 608 696 2008* 971 847 906 * Through February 29, 2008 Zinc Production from the Montana Tunnels mine also includes the extraction, processing and sale of zinc contained in sulfide concentrates. The mine produced approximately 11,900,000, 3,000,000, and 22,400,000 pounds of payable zinc in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Due to its corrosion resisting property, zinc is used primarily as the coating in galvanized steel. Galvanized steel is widely used in construction of infrastructure, housing and office buildings. In the automotive industry, zinc is used for galvanizing and die-casting and in the vulcanization of tires. Smaller quantities of various forms of zinc are used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, including fertilizers, food supplements and cosmetics, and in specialty electronic applications such as satellite receivers. -15- Annual Global Supply/ Demand Balance for Zinc, 2002-2007 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 (000 tonnes) Refined Consumption 11,667 11,107 10,629 10,651 9,848 Refined Production 11,609 10,704 10,255 10,357 9,870 Release of Inventoried Stocks 10 28 29 12 7 Increase (Decrease) World Stock (48 ) (375 ) (345 ) (282 ) 29 LME Stocks - Total 89 90 394 629 740 - Weeks’ consumption 0.4 0.4 1.9 3.1 3.9 Reported Stocks - Total 466 514 808 1,039 1,159 - Weeks’ consumption 2.1 2.3 4.0 5.1 6.1 LME Cash Price - $/tonne 3,250 3,273 1,380 1,048 828 - cents/lb 147.4 148.5 62.6 47.5 37.6 Data Source: Standard Bank Metals Report.

The silver production is derived from the gold doré as well as the lead and zinc concentrates. Silver has traditionally served as a medium of exchange, much like gold. While silver continues to be used for currency, the current principal uses of silver are for industrial uses, primarily for electrical and electronic components, photography, jewelry and silverware. Silver’s strength, malleability, ductility, thermal and electrical conductivity, sensitivity to light and ability to endure extreme changes in temperature combine to make silver a widely used industrial metal. Specifically, it is used in photography, batteries, computer chips, electrical contacts, and high technology printing. Silver’s anti-bacterial properties also make it valuable for use in medicine and in water purification. Silver Price History The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the London Metals Exchange high, low and average settlement prices of silver in U.S. dollars per ounce.

Montana Tunnels produced approximately 5,600,000, 1,200,000, and 10,400,000 pounds of payable lead in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The primary use of lead is in motor vehicle batteries, but it is also used in cable sheathing, solder in printed wiring circuits, shot for ammunition and alloying. Lead in chemical form is used in alloys, glass and plastics.

Our contract with Teck Cominco covers all concentrates produced from the Mine - L Pit. See Item 2 “Description of Properties - Montana Tunnels Mine” for further information. We have an agreement with Johnson Matthey to refine gold doré to a final finished product. Johnson Matthey receives $0.75 for each ounce of gold doré it refines, in addition to receiving a fee of 0.5% of the payable metal for silver and 0.1% of the payable metal for gold, with a minimum charge of $750 per delivery. Mineral Reserves Our proven and probable mineral reserves are estimated in conformance with definitions set out in NI 43-101 and on a basis consistent with the definition of proven and probable mineral reserves set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7. See our “Glossary of Terms.” The estimates of our mineral reserves are prepared by Apollo based on information compiled and/or validated by Mr. Richard F. Nanna, our employee and Senior Vice President of Exploration. Mr. Nanna is a professional geologist with 35 years of experience and a registered Professional Geologist in the State of Washington. Mr. Nanna is considered a qualified person under NI 43-101. Since we report our mineral reserves to both NI 43-101 and SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, it is possible for our reserve figure to vary between the two. Where such a variance occurs it will arise from the differing requirements for reporting mineral reserves. For example, the NI 43-101 has a minimum requirement that reserves be supported by a pre-feasibility study, whereas SEC Industry Guide 7 requires support from a full feasibility study done to bankable standards. The Black Fox Project thus reports reserves under NI 43-101, but reports no reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7 as a final bankable feasibility study has not been completed. No reconciliation between NI 43-101 and SEC Industry Guide 7 is included for Montana Tunnels as there are no material differences. The following table sets forth the estimated mineral reserves attributable to the interest held by Apollo.

Montana Tunnels Reserves - Apollo’s Interest Apollo’s interest in the end-of-year 2007 reserves is 21.0 million tons containing 283,700 ounces of gold, 434,000 ounces of silver, 211 million pounds of zinc, and 73 million pounds of lead. The grade model was modified in 2007 with a new indicator cut off to reflect higher metal prices. Further, the M Pit was redesigned and incorporates new geological information and better access to the north end of the pit. This combination has resulted in an increase of reserves. -18- Montana Tunnels Mine Reserve Statement at December 31, 2007 (1) (Apollo’s 50% interest) Pit (Imperial Summary) Classification Tons 000’s Grade oz Au/T Ag oz Ag/T Pb % Zn % Ounces Au 000’s L Pit Proven 3,266.0 0.0149 0.172 0.216 0.611 48.5 Mill Stockpile Proven 333.4 0.0085 0.304 0.182 0.413 2.8 Subtotal Proven 3,599.4 0.0143 0.184 0.213 0.592 51.3 L Pit Probable 12.8 0.0128 0.166 0.220 0.499 0.2 M Pit Probable 17,365.6 0.0134 0.212 0.165 0.485 232.2 Subtotal Probable 17,378.4 0.0130 0.212 0.165 0.485 232.4 Total Proven + Probable 20,977.8 0.0135 0.207 0.173 0.504 283.7 (1) Recovery rates are expected to be 77% for gold, 72% for silver, 85% for lead, and 82% for zinc.

Black Fox Reserves at February 29, 2008 On February 29, 2008, we announced a new reserve of 1,330,000 ounces of gold, an increase of 328,000 ounces, based on a gold price of $650 per ounce. We expect to file a NI 43-101 report within 45 days of February 29, 2008. We expect the NI 43-101 to be a full feasibility study done to a bankable standard (“bankable feasibility study”). A bankable feasibility study is a comprehensive analysis of a project’s economics (+/- 15% precision) used by the banking industry for financing purposes. -19- Black Fox Probable Reserve Statement As of February 29, 2008 Mining Method Cutoff Grade Au g/t Tonnes (000) Grade Au g/t Contained Au Ounces Open Pit 1.0 4,350 5.2 730,000 Underground (1) 3.0 2,110 8.8 600,000 Total Reserves 1,330,000 (1) Underground reserves assume 95% mining recovery 17% planned dilution and 5% unplanned dilution both at 0 grams per tonne grade. Employee Relations As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 230 employees, including 6 employees at our principal executive office in Greenwood Village, Colorado. Competition We compete with major mining companies and other natural mineral resource companies in the acquisition, exploration, financing and development of new prospects. Many of these companies are larger and better capitalized than we are. There is significant competition for the limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities. Our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically explore, acquire and develop new and existing mineral prospects. Factors that allow producers to remain competitive in the market over the long term include the quality and size of their ore bodies, costs of operation, and the acquisition and retention of qualified employees. We also compete with other mining companies for skilled mining engineers, mine and processing plant operators and mechanics, geologists, geophysicists and other technical personnel. This could result in higher turnover and greater labor costs.

RISK FACTORS In addition to historic information, the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward looking” statements about our future business and performance. Our actual operating results and financial performance may be very different from what we expect as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks below address some of the factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance. We have a history of losses. With the exception of the most recent fiscal year during which we had a net income of $2,416,000, we have incurred significant losses. Our net losses were $15,587,000 and $22,208,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future. -20- We have experienced operational problems at our Montana Tunnels mine. Since the sale of our Florida Canyon and Standard mines in November 2005, all of our revenues have been derived from our milling operations at the Montana Tunnels mine, which is a low grade mine. Historically, the Montana Tunnels mine has been unprofitable. During 2004, we experienced problems related to the milling of low-grade ore at the Montana Tunnels mine, which negatively affected our revenues and earnings. Throughout 2005, we experienced operational problems, particularly in the open pit, leading to the suspension of mining on October 21, 2005 for safety reasons due to increased wall activity in the open pit. After the suspension of mining and until May 12, 2006, we were able to continue to produce gold doré, lead-gold and zinc-gold concentrates from milling low grade stockpiled ore. However, on May 12, 2006, all operations ceased at the mine and it was placed on care and maintenance. On July 28, 2006, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Elkhorn Tunnels, LLC, in respect of the Montana Tunnels mine pursuant to which Elkhorn Tunnels made financial contributions in exchange for a fifty percent interest in the mine. Mill operations recommenced in March 2007, however there can be no assurances that we will not encounter additional operational problems at our Montana Tunnels mine. Our earnings may be affected by metals price volatility, specifically the volatility of gold and zinc prices. We historically have derived all of our revenues from the sale of gold, silver, lead and zinc, and our development and exploration activities are focused on gold. As a result, our future earnings are directly related to the price of gold. Changes in the price of gold significantly affect our profitability. Gold prices historically have fluctuated widely, based on numerous industry factors including: · industrial and jewelry demand; · central bank lending, sales and purchases of gold; · forward sales of gold by producers and speculators; · production and cost levels in major gold-producing regions; and · rapid short-term changes in supply and demand because of speculative or hedging activities. Gold prices are also affected by macroeconomic factors, including: · confidence in the global monetary system; · expectations of the future rate of inflation (if any); · the strength of, and confidence in, the U.S. dollar (the currency in which the price of gold is generally quoted) and other currencies; · interest rates; and · global or regional political or economic events, including but not limited to acts of terrorism. The current demand for, and supply of, gold also affects gold prices. The supply of gold consists of a combination of new production from mining and existing stock of bullion held by government central banks, public and private financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. As the amounts produced by all producers in any single year constitute a small portion of the total potential supply of gold, normal variations in current production do not usually have a significant impact on the supply of gold or on its price. Mobilization of gold held by central banks through lending and official sales may have a significant adverse impact on the price of gold. -21- All of the above factors are beyond our control and are impossible for us to predict. If the market prices for gold, silver, zinc or lead fall below our costs to produce them for a sustained period of time, we will experience additional losses and we could also be required by our reduced revenue to discontinue exploration, development and/or mining at one or more of our properties. Increased costs could affect our financial condition. We anticipate that costs at our properties including the Montana Tunnels mine, Black Fox and Huizopa as well as other properties that we may explore or develop, will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel, steel and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable or increase costs of construction. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on a project’s economic viability or on our profitability. We do not currently have and may not be able to raise the funds necessary to explore and develop our Black Fox and Huizopa properties. We do not currently have sufficient funds to complete all of our planned development activities at Black Fox and our planned exploration activities at Huizopa or to develop a mine at Black Fox. The development of Black Fox and exploration of Huizopa will require significant capital expenditures. Sources of external financing may include bank and non-bank borrowings and future debt and equity offerings. There can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The failure to obtain financing would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our results of operations and financial condition. Substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Substantially all of the Montana Tunnels assets and our Black Fox property are pledged to secure indebtedness outstanding under the Facility Agreement, dated October 12, 2007, by and among Montana Tunnels Mining, Inc., Apollo, Apollo Gold, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Apollo, RMB Australia Holdings Limited and RMB Resources Inc. Since these assets represent substantially all of our assets, we will not have access to additional secured lending until this indebtedness is repaid, which may require us to raise additional funds through unsecured debt and equity offerings. Default under our debt obligations would entitle our lenders to foreclose on our assets. The inability to raise additional working capital or the foreclosure of our assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our Huizopa exploration project is subject to political and regulatory uncertainty. Our Huizopa exploration project is located in the northern part of the Sierra Madres in the State of Chihuahua, Mexico. There are numerous risks inherent in conducting business in Mexico, including political and economic instability, exposure to currency fluctuations, greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection, difficulties in staffing and managing operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, our ability to explore and develop our Huizopa exploration project is subject to maintaining satisfactory relations with the Ejido Huizopa, which is a group of local inhabitants who under Mexican law are granted rights to conduct agricultural activities and control surface access on the property. In 2006, we entered into an agreement with the Ejido Huizopa pursuant to which we agreed to make annual payments to the Ejido Huizopa in exchange for the right to use the land covering our mining concessions for all activities necessary for the exploration, development and production of potential ore deposits. There can be no assurances that the Ejido Huizopa will continue to honor the agreement. If we are unable to successfully manage our operations in Mexico or maintain satisfactory relations with the Ejido Huizopa, our development of the Huizopa property could be hindered or terminated and, as a result, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. -22- Our reserve estimates are potentially inaccurate. We estimate our reserves on our properties as either “proven reserves” or “probable reserves.” Our ore reserve figures and costs are primarily estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of these metals. We estimate proven reserve quantities based on sampling and testing of sites conducted by us and by independent companies hired by us. Probable reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are less extensive, and the degree of certainty is less. Reserve estimation is an interpretive process based upon available geological data and statistical inferences and is inherently imprecise and may prove to be unreliable. Our reserves are reduced as existing reserves are depleted through production. Reserves may be reduced due to lower than anticipated volume and grade of reserves mined and processed and recovery rates. Reserve estimates are calculated using assumptions regarding metals prices. These prices have fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market price of metals, as well as increased production costs, capital costs and reduced recovery rates, may render reserves uneconomic to exploit, and lead to a reduction in reserves. Any material reduction in our reserves may lead to increased net losses, reduced cash flow, asset write-downs and other adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition, including difficulty in obtaining financing and a decrease in our stock price. Reserves should not be interpreted as assurances of mine life or of the profitability of current or future operations. No assurance can be given that the amount of metal estimated will be produced or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized. We may not achieve our production estimates. We prepare estimates of future production for our operations. We develop our estimates based on, among other things, mining experience, reserve estimates, assumptions regarding ground conditions and physical characteristics of ores (such as hardness and presence or absence of certain metallurgical characteristics) and estimated rates and costs of mining and processing. In the past, our actual production from time to time has been lower than our production estimates and this may be the case in the future. Each of these factors also applies to future development properties not yet in production and to the Montana Tunnels mine expansion. In the case of mines we may develop in the future, we do not have the benefit of actual experience in our estimates, and there is a greater likelihood that the actual results will vary from the estimates. In addition, development and expansion projects are subject to unexpected construction and start-up problems and delays. Our future profitability depends in part, on actual economic returns and actual costs of developing mines, which may differ significantly from our estimates and involve unexpected problems, costs and delays. We are engaged in the development of new ore bodies. Our ability to sustain or increase our present level of production is dependent in part on the successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and/or expansion of existing mining operations. Decisions about the development of Black Fox and other future projects are subject to the successful completion of feasibility studies, issuance of necessary governmental permits and receipt of adequate financing. -23- Development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. Our estimates of proven and probable ore reserves and cash operating costs are, to a large extent, based upon detailed geologic and engineering analysis. We also conduct feasibility studies that derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon many factors. It is possible that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our best estimates. It is not unusual in the mining industry for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the start-up phase and to require more capital than anticipated. There can be no assurance that the Black Fox property that we are developing will be profitable. Mineral exploration is speculative and is frequently unsuccessful. Mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature, capital intensive, involves many risks and frequently is nonproductive. There can be no assurance that our mineral exploration efforts will be successful. If we discover a site with gold or other mineralization, it will take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves through drilling, to determine metallurgical processes to extract the metals from the ore and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. As a result of these uncertainties, no assurance can be given that our exploration programs will result in the expansion or replacement of existing ore reserves that are being depleted by current production. We have a limited operating history on which to evaluate our potential for future success. We were formed as a result of a merger in June 2002 and have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. During this period, we have not generated sufficient revenues to cover our expenses and costs. The market price of our common shares could experience volatility and could decline significantly. Our common shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. Our share price has declined significantly since 2004, and in 2007 the price of our common shares fluctuated from a low of $0.36 per share to a high of $0.78 per share. Securities of small-cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. Our share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short-term changes in gold and zinc prices or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports. As a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common shares at any given point in time might not accurately reflect our long-term value. Securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management’s attention and resources. The existence of outstanding rights to purchase common shares may impair our share price and our ability to raise capital. As of March 18, 2008, approximately 34.3 million of our common shares are issuable on exercise of warrants, options or other rights to purchase common shares at prices ranging from $0.20 to $2.24. In addition, there are approximately 15.3 million common shares issuable upon the conversion of the $7.7 outstanding principal amount of convertible debentures issued February 23, 2007 at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. During the term of the warrants, options and other rights, the holders are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common shares with a resulting dilution in the interest of the other shareholders. Our ability to obtain additional equity financing during the period such rights are outstanding may be adversely affected, and the existence of the rights may have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares. The holders of the warrants, options and other rights can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the outstanding rights. -24- If we complete additional equity financings, then our existing shareholders may experience dilution. Any additional equity financing that we obtain would involve the sale of our common shares and/or sales of securities that are convertible or exercisable into our common shares, such as share purchase warrants or convertible notes. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete equity financings that are not dilutive to our existing shareholders. The titles to some of our properties may be uncertain or defective. Certain of our United States mineral rights consist of “unpatented” mining claims created and maintained in accordance with the U.S. General Mining Law of 1872. Unpatented mining claims are unique U.S. property interests, and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations that supplement the General Mining Law. Also, unpatented mining claims and related rights, including rights to use the surface, are subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government. The validity of an unpatented mining claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of federal and state statutory and decisional law. In addition, there are few public records that definitively control the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining claims. In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered a number of proposed amendments to the General Mining Law. Although no such legislation has been adopted to date, there can be no assurance that such legislation will not be adopted in the future. If ever adopted, such legislation could, among other things, impose royalties on gold production from unpatented mining claims located on federal lands or impose fees on production from patented mining claims. If such legislation is ever adopted, it could have an adverse impact on earnings from our operations, could reduce estimates of our reserves and could curtail our future exploration and development activity on federal lands or patented claims. While we have no reason to believe that our rights to mine on any of our properties are in doubt, title to mining properties are subject to potential claims by third parties. In September 2006, five of our claims associated with our Black Fox Project were listed as reopened for staking on the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) website. These claims totaling 185 acres were immediately staked by local prospectors. None of our reserves are located on these claims. Four of these overstaked claims have since been returned to us. We are negotiating with the overstaker with respect to the remaining claim; however, no guarantee can be made that such negotiations will be successful. It is our opinion that these claims were erroneously listed as open. We are working diligently to resolve this matter. We may lose rights to properties if we fail to meet payment requirements or development or production schedules. We derive the rights to most of our mineral properties from unpatented mining claims, leaseholds, joint ventures or purchase option agreements which require the payment of maintenance fees, rents, purchase price installments, exploration expenditures, or other fees. If we fail to make these payments when they are due, our rights to the property may lapse. There can be no assurance that we will always make payments by the requisite payment dates. In addition, some contracts with respect to our mineral properties require development or production schedules. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet any or all of the development or production schedules. Our ability to transfer or sell our rights to some of our mineral properties requires government approvals or third party consents, which may not be granted. -25- We face substantial governmental regulation. Safety. Our U.S. mining operation is subject to inspection and regulation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor (“MSHA”) under the provisions of the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) also has jurisdiction over safety and health standards not covered by MSHA. Our policy is to comply with applicable directives and regulations of MSHA and OSHA. We have made and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Current Environmental Laws and Regulations. We must comply with environmental standards, laws and regulations that may result in increased costs and delays depending on the nature of the regulated activity and how stringently the regulations are implemented by the regulatory authority. The costs and delays associated with compliance with such laws and regulations could stop us from proceeding with the exploration of a project or the operation or future exploration of a mine. Laws and regulations involving the protection and remediation of the environment and the governmental policies for implementation of such laws and regulations are constantly changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Some of our properties are located in historic mining districts with past production and abandoned mines. The major historical mine workings and processing facilities owned (wholly or partially) by us in Montana are being targeted by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”) for publicly funded cleanup, which reduces our exposure to financial liability. We are participating with the MDEQ under Voluntary Cleanup Plans on those sites. Our cleanup responsibilities have been completed at the Corbin Flats Facility and at the Gregory Mine site, both located in Jefferson County, Montana, under programs involving cooperative efforts with the MDEQ. MDEQ is also contemplating remediation of the Washington Mine site at public expense under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”). In February 2004, we consented to MDEQ’s entry onto the portion of the Washington Mine site owned by us to undertake publicly funded remediation under SMCRA. In March 2004, we entered into a definitive written settlement agreement with MDEQ and the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) under which MDEQ will conduct publicly funded remediation of the Wickes Smelter site under SMCRA and will grant us a site release in exchange for our donation of the portion of the site owned by us to BLM for use as a waste repository. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to resolve disputed liability for historical mine and ore processing facility waste sites on such favorable terms in the future. We remain exposed to liability, or assertions of liability, that would require expenditure of legal defense costs, under joint and several liability statutes for cleanups of historical wastes that have not yet been completed. Environmental laws and regulations may also have an indirect impact on us, such as increased costs for electricity due to acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Charges by refiners to which we sell our metallic concentrates and products have substantially increased over the past several years because of requirements that refiners meet revised environmental quality standards. We have no control over the refiners’ operations or their compliance with environmental laws and regulations. -26- Potential Legislation. Changes to the current laws and regulations governing the operations and activities of mining companies, including changes to the U.S. General Mining Law of 1872, and permitting, environmental, title, health and safety, labor and tax laws, are actively considered from time to time. We cannot predict which changes may be considered or adopted and changes in these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business. Expenses associated with the compliance with new laws or regulations could be material. Further, increased expenses could prevent or delay exploration or mine development projects and could therefore affect future levels of mineral production. We are subject to environmental risks. Environmental Liability. We are subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with environmental compliance and the disposal of waste rock and materials that occur as a result of our mineral exploration and production. To the extent that we are subject to environmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilities or the costs that we may incur to remedy any non-compliance with environmental laws would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to fully remedy an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on us. We have not purchased insurance for environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production) because it is not generally available at a reasonable price or at all. Environmental Permits. All of our exploration, development and production activities are subject to regulation under one or more of the various state, federal and provincial environmental laws and regulations in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. Many of the regulations require us to obtain permits for our activities. We must update and review our permits from time to time, and are subject to environmental impact analyses and public review processes prior to approval of the additional activities. It is possible that future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could have a significant impact on some portion of our business, causing those activities to be economically reevaluated at that time. Those risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that regulatory authorities may increase bonding requirements beyond our financial capabilities. The posting of bonds in accordance with regulatory determinations is a condition to the right to operate under all material operating permits, and therefore increases in bonding requirements could prevent our operations from continuing even if we were in full compliance with all substantive environmental laws. We face strong competition from other mining companies for the acquisition of new properties. Mines have limited lives and as a result, we may seek to replace and expand our reserves through the acquisition of new properties. In addition, there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available in the United States, Canada and Mexico and other areas where we would consider conducting exploration and/or production activities. Because we face strong competition for new properties from other mining companies, most of which have greater financial resources than we do, we may be unable to acquire attractive new mining properties. We are dependent on certain key personnel. We are currently dependent upon the ability and experience of R. David Russell, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard F. Nanna, our Senior Vice President-Exploration; and Melvyn Williams, our Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President-Finance and Corporate Development. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key officers and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain any or all of such officers. We currently do not carry key person insurance on any of these individuals, and the loss of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our operations. -27- There may be certain tax risks associated with investments in our company. Potential investors that are United States taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a “passive foreign investment company” (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although we believe that we currently are not a PFIC and do not expect to become a PFIC in the near future, the tests for determining PFIC status are dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our ability to predict or control, and we can not assure you that we will not become a PFIC in the future. If we are or become a PFIC, a U.S. taxpayer who disposes of (or is deemed to dispose of) our common shares at a gain or who receives a so-called “excess distribution” on our common shares generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime. Such gains and excess distributions would be allocated ratably to the U.S. taxpayer’s holding period. The current year’s allocation would be includible as ordinary income in the current year. Prior year’s allocations would be taxed at the highest marginal rate applicable to ordinary income for each such year and would be subject to interest charges to reflect the value of the U.S. income tax deferral. Additional special adverse rules also apply to investors who are U.S. taxpayers who own our common shares if we are a PFIC and have a non-U.S. subsidiary that is also a PFIC. Special estate tax rules could be applicable to our common shares if we are a PFIC. Possible hedging activities could expose us to losses. In connection with our $8.0 million borrowing with RMB Australia Holdings Limited in October 2007, we were required to enter into hedges of approximately 65% and 40%, respectively, of our share of lead and zinc production from the Montana Tunnels mine during the 12 months following the date of the borrowing. In the future, we may enter into precious and/or base metals hedging contracts that may involve outright forward sales contracts, spot-deferred sales contracts, the use of options which may involve the sale of call options and the purchase of all these hedging instruments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully hedge against price, currency and interest rate fluctuations. Further, there can be no assurance that the use of hedging techniques will always be to our benefit. Some hedging instruments may prevent us from realizing the benefit from subsequent increases in market prices with respect to covered production. This limitation would limit our revenues and profits. Hedging contracts are also subject to the risk that the other party may be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under these contracts. Any significant nonperformance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry. Our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards including adverse environmental effects, technical difficulties due to unusual or unexpected geologic formations, and pit wall failures. Such risks could result in personal injury, environmental damage, damage to and destruction of production facilities, delays in mining and liability. For some of these risks, we maintain insurance to protect against these losses at levels consistent with our historical experience and industry practice. However, we may not be able to maintain current levels of insurance, particularly if there is a significant increase in the cost of premiums. Insurance against environmental risks is generally too expensive or not available for us and other companies in our industry, and, therefore, we do not maintain environmental insurance. To the extent we are subject to environmental liabilities, we would have to pay for these liabilities. Moreover, in the event that we are unable to fully pay for the cost of remediating an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend or significantly curtail operations or enter into other interim compliance measures. -28- You could have difficulty or be unable to enforce certain civil liabilities on us, certain of our directors and our experts. We are a Yukon Territory, Canada, corporation. While our principal executive officer is located in the United States, many of our assets are located outside of the United States. Additionally, a number of our directors are residents of Canada. It might not be possible for investors in the United States to collect judgments obtained in United States courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities legislation. It could also be difficult for you to effect service of process in connection with any action brought in the United States upon such directors. Execution by United States courts of any judgment obtained against us, or any of the directors, executive officers or experts identified in this prospectus or documents incorporated by reference herein, in United States courts would be limited to the assets, or the assets of such persons or corporations, as the case might be, in the United States. The enforceability in Canada of United States judgments or liabilities in original actions in Canadian courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States is doubtful. -29- ITEM
