Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors Affecting Future Prospects The Company has generated only nominal income and it cannot guarantee future profitability. The Company earned net income of $668,739 in 2006, $22,241 in 2003, $61,368 in 2002 and $192,398 in 2001 and incurred losses of $3,961,937 in 2008, $2,284,605 in 2007, $1,099,990 in 2005, $2,338,693 in 2004, $2,581,337 in 2000 and $2,998,919 in 1999. At December 31, 2008, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $19,663,823. Although the Company achieved profitability in 2006, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company cannot offer any assurance that it will be able to generate sustained or significant earnings. The Company’s liquidity may be dependent upon amounts available under its existing line of credit or amounts available through additional debt or equity financings. In 2008, the Company incurred a net operating loss and generated negative cash flow from operating activities. The Company utilized funds from its line of credit to fund its operations. The Company has taken steps to improve its overall liquidity and believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its needs for the foreseeable future. However, in the event the Company’s cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to meet its requirements, the Company may be constrained either to refinance its current line of credit or seek equity financing. There can be no assurance that such financing would be available or, if available, that such financing could be obtained upon terms acceptable to the Company. The potential increase in common shares due to the conversion, exercise or vesting of outstanding dilutive securities may have a depressive effect upon the market value of the Company’s shares. Up to 19,223,291 shares of the Company’s common stock are potentially issuable upon the conversion, exercise or vesting of outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants, options and restricted stock awards (“dilutive securities”). The shares of common stock potentially issuable upon conversion, exercise or vesting of dilutive securities are substantial compared to the 40,140,743 shares of common stock currently outstanding. Earnings per share of common stock may be substantially diluted by the existence of these dilutive securities regardless of whether they are converted, exercised or issued. This dilution of earnings per share could have a depressive effect upon the market value of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s stock price has been volatile and this volatility is likely to continue. Historically, the market price of the Company’s common stock has been volatile. The high and low prices for the years 2004 through 2008 are set forth in the table below: 9 Derma Sciences, Inc. Trading Range  Common Stock Year Low High 2004 $0.43 $1.90 2005 $0.42 $0.78 2006 $0.45 $0.90 2007 $0.58 $1.40 2008 $0.20 $1.35 Events that may affect the Company’s common stock price include: · Quarter to quarter variations in its operating results; · Changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts; · Changes in interest rates or other general economic conditions; · Changes in market conditions in the wound care and skin care industries; · The introduction of new products either by the Company or by its competitors; and · The loss of a major customer. Although all publicly traded securities are subject to price and volume fluctuations, it is likely that the Company’s common stock will experience these fluctuations to a greater degree than the securities of more established and better capitalized organizations. The Company has not paid, and is unlikely to pay in the near future, cash dividends on its securities. The Company has never paid any cash dividends on its common or preferred stock and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends by the Company will depend on its future earnings, financial condition and such other business and economic factors as the Company’s management may consider relevant. The Company’s foreign operations are essential to its economic success and are subject to various unique risks. The Company’s future operations and earnings will depend to a large extent on the results of its operations in Canada and its ability to maintain a continuous supply of basic wound care products from its operations and suppliers in China. While the Company does not envision any adverse change to operations in Canada and China, adverse changes to these operations, as a result of political, governmental, regulatory, economic, exchange rates, labor, logistical or other factors, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s future operating results. The rate of reimbursement for the purchase of the Company’s products by government and private insurance is subject to change. Sales of several of the Company’s wound care products depend partly on the ability of its customers to obtain reimbursement for the cost of its products from government health administration agencies such as Medicare and Medicaid. Both government health administration agencies and private insurance firms continuously seek to reduce healthcare costs. These cost reduction efforts may adversely affect both the eligibility of the Company’s products for reimbursement and the rate of reimbursement. Although management believes that reimbursement policies relative to the Company’s products will remain stable for the foreseeable future, it can offer no assurance that the Company’s products will continue to be eligible for reimbursement indefinitely or that the rate of reimbursement will not be reduced. 10 The Company’s success may depend upon its ability to protect its patents and proprietary technology. The Company owns patents, both in the United States and abroad, for several of its products, and relies upon the protection afforded by its patents and trade secrets to protect its technology. The Company’s success may depend upon its ability to protect its intellectual property. However, the enforcement of intellectual property rights can be both expensive and time consuming. Therefore, the Company may not be able to devote the resources necessary to prevent infringement of its intellectual property. Also, the Company’s competitors may develop or acquire substantially similar technologies without infringing the Company’s patents or trade secrets. For these reasons, the Company cannot be certain that its patents and proprietary technology will provide it with a competitive advantage. If members of the Company’s management and their affiliates were to exercise all warrants and options held by them, and if substantially all of the authorized but unissued restricted stock awards were granted to members of management and were to vest, members of management and their affiliates could acquire effective control of the Company. The executive officers and directors of the Company, together with institutions with which they are affiliated, own substantial amounts of the Company’s common stock, together with outstanding options and warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock. In addition, the Company has adopted, and its shareholders have approved, a restricted stock plan pursuant to which the Company’s outside directors and executive officers may be awarded up to 2,500,000 shares of restricted stock. Outside directors have been awarded to date 175,000 shares of restricted common stock that have not yet vested. Depending upon the warrants and options exercised by outside investors, if directors, executive officers and affiliates were to exercise their options and warrants, and if additional shares of restricted stock are awarded to the Company’s directors and executive officers and such awards vest, members of management and their affiliates could obtain effective control of the Company. As a result, these officers, directors and affiliates of the Company would be in a position to significantly influence the strategic direction of the Company, the composition of its board of directors and the outcome of fundamental transactions requiring shareholder approval. Government regulation plays a significant role in the Company’s ability to acquire and market products. Government regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar agencies in other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacturing and marketing of many of the Company’s products and in the Company’s acquisition or licensing of new products. Complying with government regulations is often time consuming and expensive and may involve delays or actions adversely impacting the marketing and sale of the Company’s current or future products. Approximately seventy-five percent of the Company’s products are manufactured by third party manufacturers. Approximately seventy-five percent of the Company’s products are manufactured by third party manufacturers. One manufacturer produces advanced wound care products which account for about twenty percent of the Company’s sales. Each of the Company’s other manufacturers produce products that individually account for less than ten percent of the Company’s sales. The Company maintains good relations with its third party manufacturers. Although there are several manufacturers potentially available for each of the Company’s products, if a current manufacturer were unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture the Company’s products, distribution and sales of the affected products could be delayed for the period necessary to secure a replacement. 11 Competitors could invent products superior to those of the Company and cause its products and technology to become obsolete. The Company operates in an industry where technological developments occur at a rapid pace. The Company competes with a large number of established companies and institutions many of which have more capital, larger staffs and greater expertise than the Company. The Company also competes with a number of smaller companies. The Company’s competitors currently manufacture and distribute a variety of products that are in many respects comparable to those of the Company. While management has no specific knowledge of products under development by the Company’s competitors, it is possible that these competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than any the Company currently has. If this occurs, any of the Company’s products and technology affected by these developments could become obsolete. Although the Company is insured, any material product liability claims could adversely affect its business. The Company sells over-the-counter products and medical devices and is exposed to the risk of lawsuits claiming alleged injury caused by its products. Among the grounds for potential claims against the Company are injuries due to alleged product inefficacy and injuries resulting from infection due to allegedly non-sterile products. Although the Company carries product liability insurance with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million aggregate with $10.0 million in umbrella coverage, this insurance may not be adequate to reimburse the Company for all damages that it could suffer as a result of successful product liability claims. No material product liability claim has ever been made against the Company and management is not aware of any pending product liability claims. However, a successful material product liability suit could adversely affect the Company’s business.
