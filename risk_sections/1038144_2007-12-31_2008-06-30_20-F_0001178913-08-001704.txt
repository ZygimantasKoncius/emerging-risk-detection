RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE COMPANY: WE HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER CUSTOMERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES. THE LOSS OF ANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS OR A MATERIAL DECREASE IN THE QUANTITY OF SALES TO ANY OF THEM COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REVENUES. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, three customers represented approximately 39%, 44% and 37%, respectively, of our sales. For the years ended December 31, 2006, and 2005 one customer accounted for 24% and 13%, respectively, of our sales. For the year 2007 sales to this customer accounted for only 6.4% of our sales, as the customer ceased the purchase of most of our products as of the fourth quarter of 2006. We expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. We do not have long-term purchase contracts with our customers and our sales arrangements with them do not have minimum purchase requirements. 6 We cannot assure you that these customers will continue to buy our products at all or in the same volumes or on the same terms as they have in the past. Their failure to do so may significantly reduce our sales. For example, in 2006 we lost a major customer, which resulted in a significant reduction in sales to this customer in 2007 (from approximately $3.3 million in 2006 to approximately $0.6 million in 2007). In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new customers. The loss of our significant customers or a material decrease in the quantity of sales to any of them, or a material adverse change in the terms of such sales, or a material adverse change in the financial conditions of our principal customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and revenues. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE WITH LARGER INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES; AS A SMALLER COMPANY WE MAY LACK THE OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL, MARKETING, HUMAN, AND OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED TO MAINTAIN OR CAPTURE INCREASED MARKET SHARE; OUR REVENUES MAY DECREASE AS OUR COMPETITORS INTRODUCE EQUIVALENT PRODUCTS. The segment of the market in which we compete is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation. Companies concentrate their development and sales efforts on specific small market niches because many customers, especially original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), require high levels of support and technical expertise. Competition is primarily on the basis of cost, performance, capabilities, reliability, support, and safety. Many of our competitors are international companies with significantly larger operations and greater financial, marketing, human, and other resources than ours, which may give them competitive advantages, such as the ability to market their products in larger quantities and at lower prices than us. Our sales and our sale prices may decline significantly as our competitors introduce equivalent or superior products at lower prices than our own products. Our overall profitability depends on our ability to continuously introduce new advanced products at competitive prices. We may not be able to introduce new advanced products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our competitors are moving their manufacturing facilities to countries where the cost of production is significantly lower than in Israel and the United States, where we produce most of our products, thus decreasing their cost and thereby the sale price of their products. OUR ABILITY TO STAY COMPETITIVE AND OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE ADDITIONAL MOTION CONTROL PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. Our ability to stay competitive and future results of operations depend, to a significant degree, upon our ability to successfully develop additional products and achieve increased market penetration. We must develop, test and manufacture products and prove that our products are competitive from both a technological and cost perspective. Our products must meet industry standards in the geographical regions in which we operate. The development and commercialization process of our products is both time-consuming and costly and involves business risks. Our future products, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as we expect or compete successfully with products developed by our competitors. Further, there can be no assurance that the cost of our future development efforts will not materially increase due to technological or other advancements. WE DEPEND ON KEY SUPPLIERS FOR THE SUPPLY OF ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. IF ANY OF OUR KEY SUPPLIERS WILL SUPPLY US COMPONENTS ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS, OR WILL STOP SUPPLYING SUCH COMPONENTS TO US AT ALL, OUR PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We depend on the supply of essential components in our motion control systems by suppliers who are the single source of supply of such items. Among such components are processors, servo processors, and other motion controller components. As we have no supply agreements with these companies, we cannot guarantee that such suppliers will continue to make such components, will continue to supply us with such components on favorable terms, or will supply such components to us at all, in the future. For example, we have received an end of life notice from certain suppliers of some of these single source components. Consequently, we have procured an inventory of these items that we anticipate will last at least until the year 2012. By that time we plan to introduce a next generation controller, which requires only standard off-the-shelf components, and which will eventually replace our current product line. The lack of guaranteed supply arrangements can result in delays in obtaining components from time to time. In any such event, our production capabilities could be materially adversely affected. Although we maintain an inventory of critical components used in the manufacturing and assembly of our products, there can be no assurance that such supplies will be sufficient. For further information see Item 4B. - Business Overview - Production and Sources of Supply. 7 WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. In 2007, we derived 100% of our revenues in U.S. Dollars or in Shekels linked to the U.S. Dollar. Conversely, in 2007, 34% of our expenses were denominated in New Israeli Shekels, or Shekels. Our Shekel-denominated liabilities consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future a material portion of our liabilities will continue to be denominated in Shekels. If the value of the U.S. Dollar in which our receivables are denominated devalues against the value of the Shekel in which our liabilities are denominated, there will be a negative impact on our operating margins, as well as on our net income. In 2007 the Dollar devalued by 9% against the Shekel. As a result of this and inflation in Israel, the Dollar cost of operations in Israel, as measured by the differential between the rate of inflation in Israel and any change in the value of the NIS in relation to the U.S. Dollar, increased by approximately 12%. The same trend strongly continued in the beginning of 2008, and we cannot assure you that we will not continue to be materially adversely affected. We do not currently utilize, and have no plans to utilize in the future, currency hedging instruments, and we do not hold or issue derivative securities. In addition, if we wish to maintain the dollar-denominated value of our products in non-U.S. markets, devaluation in the local currencies of our customers relative to the U.S. dollar could cause our customers to cancel or decrease orders or default on payment. For more information, see Item 5A - Operating Results - "Impact of Currency Fluctuations and Inflation." OWNERSHIP OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES IS CONCENTRATED WHICH MAY DELAY, IMPEDE OR DISCOURAGE A TRANSACTION BENEFICIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. As of June 15, 2008, Ze'ev Kirshenboim, our Chairman of the Board of the Directors and Chief Financial Officer, beneficially owned approximately 39.9% of our outstanding Ordinary Shares, of which 0.2% of our outstanding Ordinary Shares is beneficially owned by Mr. Kirshenboim's wife, and of which approximately 10.5% of our outstanding Ordinary Shares is beneficially owned jointly together with Mr. Jacob Engel. As of June 15, 2008, Jacob Engel, one of our directors and a brother-in-law to Mr. Kirshenboim, beneficially owned approximately 29.1% of our Ordinary Shares, of which approximately 10.5% of our outstanding Ordinary Shares is beneficially owned jointly with Mr. Kirshenboim. Together as of June 15, 2008, Mr. Kirshenboim and Mr. Engel beneficially own 58.5% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares. The concentration of our share ownership may: o delay or prevent a change in control of the company; o impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other transaction involving the company; or o discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company. OUR TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGNS ARE NOT PROTECTED BY PATENTS; THE SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OUR TECHNOLOGY MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE UPON THE PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE, LIMIT OUR GROWTH, REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY, AND INCREASE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. Our ability to compete effectively depends, and will depend, in large part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technologies. We currently do not hold, have not filed for, and have no intention of filing for, patent protection in any country with respect to our proprietary technology. We depend on trade secret laws, copyright law, unfair competition law and upon the execution by our officers, directors, employees, consultants and subcontractors of confidentiality agreements relating to the proprietary nature of our technology to protect our intellectual property. These laws and confidentiality agreements do not, however, provide complete protection, and to the extent that they do not adequately protect our technology, others may independently develop our know-how and obtain our proprietary information or otherwise design around the confidentiality agreements entered with us. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in deterring others from developing or marketing, legally or otherwise, competitive products utilizing our proprietary designs and technologies, which could cause us to lose market share, limit our growth, reduce our profitability and increase our operating expenses. 8 Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our technology will not be found to infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of others. If we should be found to infringe upon the patents or otherwise impermissibly utilize the intellectual property of others, our ability to utilize our technology could be materially restricted or prohibited. In such event we may be required to obtain licenses from such third parties or otherwise redesign our products so as not to utilize such intellectual property, each of which may be uneconomical or otherwise impossible. We cannot assure you that any license required under any such patents or proprietary rights could be obtained on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The trend toward litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the technology industry exposes us to litigation by third parties. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. REAL OR PERCEIVED FUTURE SALES OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET AND LOW TRADING VOLUME COULD CAUSE OUR SHARE PRICE TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE, OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. As of June 15, 2008 we have approximately 3.3 million Ordinary Shares outstanding. Approximately 26% of these shares are "restricted securities" available for resale, subject, however, to volume limitations under Rule 144. Future sales of these restricted shares, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Ordinary Shares. In addition, we have experienced a low trading volume of our Ordinary Shares, and if one or a small number of parties buys or sells a large number of our Ordinary Shares, we may experience volatility in our share price and our share price may significantly decline. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our Ordinary Shares or other securities. OUR SHARE PRICE HAS FLUCTUATED IN THE PAST AND MAY CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE. The market price of our Ordinary Shares has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price of our Ordinary Shares may be significantly affected by factors such as the announcements of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors, technological innovations by us or our competitors or quarterly variations in our results of operations. In addition, any statements or changes in estimates by analysts covering our shares or relating to the motion control systems industry could result in an immediate effect that may be adverse on the market price of our shares. Trading in shares of companies listed on Nasdaq Capital Markets in general, and trading in shares of technology companies in particular, has been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that have been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. These factors may depress the market price of our Ordinary Shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. Securities litigation has also often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. In the future, we may be the target of similar litigation that could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management's attention and resources. 9 OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN PERSONNEL WITH NECESSARY SKILLS WHEN NEEDED, OUR BUSINESS AND EXPANSION PLANS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel is critical to our operations and expansion, especially our research and development and marketing capabilities. We face competition for such personnel from other companies and organizations, many of which have significantly larger operations and greater financial, marketing, human, and other resources than we do. Due to the high level of mobility in our industry, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to retain key personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain personnel with necessary skills when needed, our business and expansion plans could be materially adversely affected. RISKS FACTORS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRY: ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF SPECIFIC MARKET SEGMENTS THAT WE TARGET COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SALES. Our products are designed especially for segments within the industrial sector for systems such as advanced medical scanners, printing machinery, electronic manufacturing and inspection, LCD monitors, and semi-conductor manufacturing and inspection equipment. A slowdown in certain geographical regions such as Western Europe, the Far East and the United States, or in certain industries, such as the electronic and semiconductors industries, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. The manufacturing of motion control systems for the semiconductor and electronic industry is our most significant field of activity, amounting to approximately 47% of our revenues in 2007. The rest of our revenues are derived mainly from the medical scanning industry, the printing industry, and the general automation industry. The semiconductor and electronics industry is highly volatile and unpredictable, and we are subject to the industry's business cycles, the timing, length, and volatility of which are difficult to predict. For example, a significant slowdown in the flat panel display industry throughout 2007 and in the semiconductor equipment industry in the second half of 2007 resulted in a significant decrease in demand for our products in the semiconductor and electronic industry markets. Industry Analysts say that relatively flat bookings and billings in the beginning of 2008 for North American semiconductor equipment reflect a continued conservative mood in the industry. We must effectively manage our resources and production capacity to meet changing demand. During periods of decreasing demand for motion control products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions and effectively manage our supply chain. During periods of increasing demand, we must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and must be able to effectively manage our supply chain. If we are not able to timely and appropriately align our cost structure with business conditions and/or to effectively manage our resources and production capacity, including our supply chain, during changes in demand, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES MAY HINDER OUR GROWTH AND RESULT IN DECREASED SALES. The motion control industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. Our ability to compete successfully depends, and will continue to depend, in large part, on our ability to maintain a technically competent staff, to maintain rigorous quality control procedures, and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the motion control industry. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain such staff or keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace. In the event that we are unable to maintain such staff or otherwise keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace, we might lose market share, and our prospects and sales could be materially adversely affected. BECAUSE WE OPERATE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RISKS. We currently sell our products in a number of countries. Our business is subject to risks, which often characterize international markets, including: o potentially weak protection of intellectual property rights; 10 o economic and political instability; o import or export licensing requirements; o trade restrictions; o difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; o longer payment cycles; o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs; o seasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world, such as during the summer months in Europe; o fluctuations in exchange rates; and o potentially adverse tax consequences. RISKS FACTORS RELATED TO OUR LOCATION: WE RECEIVE TAX BENEFITS FROM THE STATE OF ISRAEL THAT MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED IN THE FUTURE. We benefit from certain Israeli Government tax legislation, particularly regarding our production facilities in Israel. The loss or reduction of such benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 5A. - Operating Results - "Effective Corporate Tax Rate" THE GOVERNMENT GRANTS WE HAVE RECEIVED FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS AND TRANSFER TECHNOLOGIES OUTSIDE OF ISRAEL AND REQUIRE US TO SATISFY SPECIFIED CONDITIONS. IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY THESE CONDITIONS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REFUND GRANTS PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED TOGETHER WITH INTEREST AND PENALTIES. From 1988 to 2007, we received grants totaling approximately $4.61 million from the government of Israel through the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Employment for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures. The terms of the OCS grants prohibit us from manufacturing products or transferring technologies developed using these grants outside of Israel without special approvals. Even if we receive approval to manufacture the OCS supported products outside of Israel, we would be required to pay an increased total amount of royalties to the OCS, which may be up to 300% of the grant amount plus interest, depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside of Israel. This restriction may impair our ability to outsource manufacturing or engage in similar arrangement for those products or technologies. In addition, we are prohibited from transferring to third parties in Israel the technology developed with these grants without the prior approval of a governmental committee. If we fail to comply with any of the conditions imposed by the OCS, we may be required to refund any grants previously received together with interest and penalties. In recent years, the government of Israel has accelerated the rate of repayment of OCS grants from 3% to 3.5% and may further accelerate them in the future. THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF SCIENTIST HAS REQUESTED THAT WE MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY U.S. $850,000. IF WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENT, IT WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY. The OCS claims that the royalties we owe with respect to past OCS funding of part of our research and development activities should be computed on sales of all of our products, and not only on sales of products that we claim were developed with the OCS support. Accordingly, the OCS has asked for additional royalties in the amount of approximately U.S. $850,000. We believe, based on the opinion of our legal advisors, that we do not owe any additional royalties to the OCS. We believe that our computations are correct and discussions are being held with the OCS in order to settle the matter. We have not recorded a provision with respect to the above amount in our financial statements. 11 PROVISIONS OF ISRAELI LAW COULD DELAY, PREVENT, OR MAKE DIFFICULT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, AND THEREFORE DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES. Provisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent, or make an acquisition of all or a significant portion of our shares or assets undesirable. Israeli corporate law regulates acquisitions of shares through tender offers and mergers, requires special approvals for transactions involving significant shareholders, and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions. These provisions of Israeli law could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for our ordinary shares. See Item 10B. - Memorandum and Articles of Association - "Approval of Certain Transactions" and "-Change of Control". Furthermore, Israeli tax law treats some acquisitions, such as stock-for-stock exchanges between an Israeli company and a foreign company, less favorably than U.S. tax laws. For example, Israeli tax law may, under certain circumstances, subject a shareholder who exchanges his ordinary shares for shares in another corporation to taxation prior to the sale of the shares received in such a stock-for-stock swap. SERVICE OF PROCESS ON AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS AGAINST OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE. We are incorporated in Israel. The majority of our executive officers and directors are not residents of the United States, and the majority of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to enforce a U.S. court judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws in an Israeli court against us or any of these persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the United States. Additionally, it may difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. Even if U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a matter of fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. In addition, there is little binding case law in Israel addressing the matters described above. WE MAY BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY LESS THAN STABLE POLITICAL AND MILITARY CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL. ANY HOSTILITIES INVOLVING ISRAEL OR THREATENING ISRAEL, OR THE INTERRUPTION OR CURTAILMENT OF TRADE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITS PRESENT TRADING PARTNERS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. We are incorporated under the laws of and our principal executive offices and research and development facilities are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business. Israeli economy has suffered in the past and may suffer in the future from instability, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Following the recession and the instability that characterized the Israeli economy during the years 2001 and 2003, the Israeli economy showed signs of improvement during 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The Israeli economy has also been subject to significant changes, as a result of implementation of new economic policies and privatization. If the results of these changes are unsuccessful or the economic deterioration in Israel continues, it may also adversely affect our financial conditions, the results of operations and our ability to obtain financing from Israeli banks. In addition, since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners could affect adversely our operations. Since October 2000, terrorist violence in Israel has increased significantly, primarily in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Israel has experienced terrorist incidents within its borders. Recently, there has been a further escalation in violence among Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority and other groups. In addition, in July 2006, there have been extensive hostilities along Israel's northern border with Lebanon and to a lesser extent in the Gaza Strip. Since June 2007, the Hamas militant group has taken over the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority, and the hostilities along Israel's border with the Gaza Strip have increased. Ongoing and revived hostilities or other Israeli political or economic factors could harm our operations and product development and cause our sales to decrease. Furthermore, several countries, principally those in the Middle East, still restrict business with Israel and Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may limit seriously our ability to sell our products in these countries. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR PERSONNEL TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE All male adult citizens under the age of approximately 48, unless exempt, are obligated to perform military service duty annually for a period of up to approximately 36 days. Additionally, they can be called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances. Should the hostilities in the region continue to escalate, some of our officers and employees could be called to substantial active military duty, possibly resulting in delays in shipments to customers and other adverse impacts on our business and operations which we can not currently assess. 12
