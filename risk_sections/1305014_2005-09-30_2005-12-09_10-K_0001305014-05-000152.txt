ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Set forth below are the most significant risks and uncertainties that affect Ashland and its businesses: ASHLAND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOY THE PROCEEDS OF THE MAP TRANSACTION IN A MANNER THAT WOULD REPLACE THE CASH FLOW AND THE VALUE PROVIDED BY THE ASSETS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO MARATHON. Ashland may not successfully identify uses for the MAP Transaction proceeds that will generate value for Ashland and its shareholders. In addition, those uses may not generate the cash flow previously generated by Ashland's interest in the assets that were transferred to Marathon. Distributions from MAP in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2005, and the two full fiscal years prior to this fiscal year have represented a majority of Ashland's operating cash flow. If Ashland's use of the proceeds of the MAP Transaction does not generate cash flow in an amount equal to the cash flow from the assets that were transferred to Marathon, this could have an adverse impact on Ashland's valuation or long-term liquidity. To the extent that the proceeds of the MAP Transaction are used for future business acquisitions, the process of integrating acquired operations into Ashland's existing operations may result in unforeseen difficulties. Those difficulties might reduce Ashland's profitability and delay the expected benefits of integrating any acquisition. SEVERAL OF ASHLAND'S BUSINESSES ARE CYCLICAL IN NATURE, AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS OR DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR CERTAIN DURABLE GOODS MAY REDUCE ITS PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES. The profitability of Ashland's businesses is susceptible to downturns in the economy, particularly downturns in the segments of the U.S. economy related to the purchase and sale of durable goods, including the housing, construction, automotive and marine industries. Both overall demand for Ashland's products and services and its profitability may decline as a direct result of an economic recession, inflation, changes in the prices of hydrocarbons and other raw materials, consumer confidence, interest rates or governmental fiscal policies. ADVERSE CHANGES IN PREVAILING CLIMATE OR WEATHER MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF SOME OF ASHLAND'S OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE ASHLAND'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY. Extreme variations from normal climatic conditions could have a significant effect on the operating results of APAC's construction operations. In particular, unfavorable weather conditions could delay the completion of construction projects and may require the use of additional resources. In addition, certain of the products sold by Valvoline are seasonal in nature, and thus demand for those products may decline due to significant changes in prevailing climate and weather conditions such as floods, frozen rivers and hurricanes. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ASHLAND'S CHEMICAL SECTOR SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION PROJECT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT ASHLAND'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. Ashland is undergoing a major process initiative designed to optimize the supply chain function in Ashland's Chemical Sector. By integrating the supply chain function of the Chemical Sector's business units and creating more efficient, customer responsive processes including source-to-pay, plan-to-deliver and order-to-cash, Ashland can lower costs, while increasing service levels and customer satisfaction. While extensive planning is underway to support the optimization of the Chemical Sector's Supply Chain, such implementations carry substantial project risk, including the potential for business interruption and associated adverse impacts on operating results. ASHLAND'S IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS SAP(TM) ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING ("ERP") PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND ASSOCIATED ADVERSE IMPACT ON OPERATING RESULTS. In 2004, Ashland initiated a multi-year ERP project that is expected to be implemented worldwide across the Chemical Sector to achieve increased efficiency and effectiveness in supply chain, financial and environmental, health and safety processes. In October 2005, Ashland successfully completed the implementation of the ERP 9 system in Canada. While extensive planning is underway to support a smooth implementation of the ERP system worldwide, such implementations carry substantial project risk, including the potential for business interruption and associated adverse impacts on operating results. ASHLAND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND HAS FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO, LIABILITIES FROM PENDING AND THREATENED CLAIMS, INCLUDING THOSE ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS, WHICH COULD REDUCE ASHLAND'S CASH FLOWS AND PROFITABILITY AND COULD IMPAIR ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION. There are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability and other environmental matter which seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While these actions are being contested, their outcome is not predictable. In addition, Ashland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation ("Riley"), a former subsidiary of Ashland. Although Riley was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos, its industrial boilers contained some asbestos-containing components provided by other companies. As a result of the transactions, Ashland is responsible for, and has financial exposure to, these liabilities, which could reduce Ashland's cash flows and profitability and impair its financial condition. ASHLAND HAS INCURRED AND WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS A RESULT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY LIABILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO ITS CHEMICAL SECTOR, WHICH COULD REDUCE ASHLAND'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY. Ashland is subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety. These laws and regulations regulate discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated properties. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be substantial and may increase as applicable requirements become more stringent and new rules are implemented. If Ashland violates the requirements of these laws and regulations, it may be forced to pay substantial fines, to complete additional costly projects, or to modify or curtail its operations to limit contaminant emissions. Ashland is responsible for, and has financial exposure to, substantially all of the environmental liabilities and other liabilities of Ashland and its subsidiaries. However, in connection with Ashland's transfer of its 38% interest in MAP to Marathon, the parties agreed that Ashland would not be liable for environmental costs related to the Transferred Assets incurred on or after January 1, 2004 in excess of $50 million. Ashland has investigated and remediated a number of its current and former properties. Engineering studies, probability techniques, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashland's ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. Ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as remediation continues. ASHLAND HAS LIMITED USE OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE MAP TRANSACTION TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASE SHARES WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON ASHLAND'S STOCK PRICE. Ashland has made certain representations of its intent with regard to the use of the proceeds from the MAP Transaction to the Internal Revenue Service and to Marathon. These representations include one to the effect that Ashland intends to comply with Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 96-30, which generally requires that (i) any share repurchase be done in the open market and (ii) Ashland does not intend to repurchase more than 20% of its outstanding shares. Ashland's limited use of the proceeds from the MAP Transaction could have an adverse impact on Ashland's stock price. 10 THE AVAILABILITY AND COSTS OF FINANCINGS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE MAP TRANSACTION DUE TO CONCURRENT OR SUBSEQUENT REDUCTIONS IN DEBT RATINGS. Concurrent with the closing of the MAP Transaction, Moody's Investors Service reduced Ashland's long term debt rating to Ba1, a non-investment grade rating. On September 22, 2005, Standard & Poor's reduced Ashland's long term debt rating to BBB- with a negative outlook. Ashland's access to debt markets at times may be limited due to these reduced ratings, and Ashland is likely to incur higher costs for debt financings. PROVISIONS OF ASHLAND'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS, ITS RIGHTS AGREEMENT AND KENTUCKY LAW COULD DETER TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS THAT SOME SHAREHOLDERS MAY CONSIDER DESIRABLE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ASHLAND'S STOCK PRICE. Provisions of Ashland's articles of incorporation and by-laws make acquiring control of Ashland without the support of its Board of Directors difficult for a third party, even if the change of control might be beneficial to Ashland shareholders. Ashland's articles of incorporation and by-laws contain: - provisions relating to the classification, nomination and removal of its directors; - provisions limiting the right of shareholders to call special meetings of its Board of Directors and shareholders; - provisions regulating the ability of its shareholders to bring matters for action at annual meetings of its shareholders; and - the authorization given to its Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. In addition, Ashland's shareholder rights agreement could cause extreme dilution to any person or group who attempts to acquire a significant interest in Ashland without advance approval of its Board of Directors. Ashland's articles of incorporation and the laws of Kentucky impose some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between Ashland and any beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of its outstanding common stock. The existence of these provisions may deprive shareholders of any opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price for Ashland common stock. The potential inability of Ashland shareholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for its common stock. ASHLAND MAY ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK WHOSE TERMS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VOTING POWER OR VALUE OF ITS COMMON STOCK. Ashland's articles of incorporation authorizes it to issue, without the approval of its shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over its common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as its Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of Ashland's common stock. For example, Ashland could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of its directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences Ashland could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of its common stock. ITEM 1B.
