ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Our engagements with clients may not be profitable. The pricing and other terms of our client contracts, particularly our long-term IT outsourcing agreements, require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. These estimates reflect our best judgments regarding the nature of the engagement and our expected costs to provide the contracted services. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable, which would have an adverse affect on our profit margin. Our exposure to this risk increases generally in proportion to the scope of the client contract and is higher in the early stages of such contract. In addition, a majority of our IT outsourcing contracts contain some fixed-price, incentive-based or other pricing terms that condition our fee on our ability to meet defined goals. Our failure to meet a client's expectations in any type of contract may result in an unprofitable engagement. Our ability to recover significant capital investments in certain construct contracts is subject to risks. Some of our client contracts require significant investment in the early stages which is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the contract. These contracts often involve the construction of new computer systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies. Substantial performance risk exists in each contract with these characteristics, and some or all elements of service delivery under these contracts are dependent upon successful completion of the development, construction and deployment phases. At December 31, 2007, approximately $535 million of our deferred construct and set-up costs related to contracts with active construct activities. We normally have approximately 20 to 25 active construct contracts with deferred costs in excess of $1 million. Some of these contracts experience delays in their development and construction phases and certain milestones may be missed. Therefore, it is reasonably possible that deferred costs associated with one or more of these contracts could become impaired due to changes in estimates of future contract cash flows. A decline in revenues from or loss of significant clients could reduce our revenues and profitability. Our success is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients, including in particular revenues from certain "mega-deal" long-term IT outsourcing agreements. We may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition, business failure, contract expiration or their conversion to a competing service provider or decision to in-source services. We may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients in the future. As a result of business downturns or for other business reasons, we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients, which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services. We may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client or reduction in services in the short or long-term. In addition, our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience. In these cases we seek, through the terms of the contract, to recover our investment in the contract. There is no assurance we will be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances. Pending litigation could have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and financial condition. We are defendants in various claims and pending actions arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. We refer you to the discussion of "Pending Litigation and Proceedings" under Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of one of these matters. We are not able to predict the ultimate impact of these matters on us or our consolidated financial statements. However, we may be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses in aggregate amounts that could have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and earnings. If we are unable to protect client information from theft or loss, our reputation could be harmed, and we could suffer significant financial loss. As with all IT outsourcing companies, we are vulnerable to negative impacts if sensitive information from our clients or their customers is inadvertently compromised or lost. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our clients which includes sensitive and personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers, healthcare information, credit card and personal financial information. We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws designed to protect this information. Loss or compromise of this data could cost us both monetarily and in terms of client good will and lost business. In order to reduce the risk of such an incident and minimize the consequences should one occur, we continually enhance our comprehensive security program combining industry best practices, specific industry regulatory requirements, and various global security standards. Notwithstanding this comprehensive security program, there can be no assurance that we will not experience a data loss or security breach that would materially adversely impact our earnings or liquidity. Our exposure to certain industries and financially troubled customers may adversely affect our financial results. Our exposure to certain industries and financially troubled customers has had, and could in the future have, a material adverse affect on our financial position and our results of operations. For example, we are a leading provider of IT outsourcing services to the United States automobile and airline industries, which sectors have experienced significant financial difficulties. 6 Impact of rating agency downgrades. Any adverse action by Moody's, S&P or Fitch with respect to our long-term credit ratings could materially adversely impact our ability to compete for new business, our cost of capital and our ability to access capital. Some of our contracts contain benchmarking provisions that could decrease our revenues and profitability. Some of our IT outsourcing agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third-party benchmarker. Typically, benchmarking may not be conducted during the initial years of the contract term but may be requested by a client periodically thereafter, subject to restrictions which limit benchmarking to certain groupings of services and limit the number of times benchmarking may be conducted during the term of the contract. Generally, the benchmarking compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group, subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors. Generally, if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range, and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client, then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing. This may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services. Due to the enhanced focus of our clients on reducing their technology costs, as well as the uncertainties and complexities inherent in benchmarking comparisons, our clients may increasingly attempt to obtain additional price reductions beyond those already embedded in our contract rates through the exercise of benchmarking provisions. Also, if we cannot agree with our client on post-benchmarking pricing adjustments, the contract may permit the client to exercise an early termination right, which may or may not involve payment of a termination fee. Such activities could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flow in 2008 or thereafter to a greater extent than has been our prior experience. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively. The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Our primary competitors are IT service providers, large consulting and other professional service firms, applications service providers, telecommunications companies, packaged software vendors and resellers and service groups of computer equipment companies. We also experience competition from numerous smaller, niche-oriented and regionalized service providers. Our business experiences rapid changes in the competitive landscape, with our competitors moving operations offshore to reduce their costs as well as increased competition from offshore providers, primarily India-based competitors. The competition from India-based companies continues to grow in intensity due to the abundance of highly skilled workers in the country, a pro-business regulatory environment and significantly lower costs of labor. Although we have significantly increased our labor resources in India and other lower cost locations in recent years, competitors with a greater presence in such areas may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Any of these factors may impose additional pricing pressure on us, which could have an adverse affect on our revenues and profit margin. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with accumulated tax losses and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income over the expiration period of the tax asset. An impairment of deferred tax assets would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and related tax expense in the period of impairment and could affect our profitability. Risks associated with our non-U.S. operations could negatively affect our earnings. Non-U.S. operations accounted for approximately 48% of our revenues in 2007 and will continue to represent a substantial portion of our business. Our results of operations are affected by our ability to manage risks inherent in doing business abroad. These risks include exchange rate fluctuation, regulatory concerns, terrorist activity, restrictions with respect to the movement of currency, access to highly skilled labor, political and economic instability and our ability to protect our intellectual property. Any of these risks could result in increased costs or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and may also impede our ability to expand our international business. As of December 31, 2007, we owned an approximately 61% interest in MphasiS Limited, a publicly traded applications and business process outsourcing services company based in Bangalore, India. In connection with this investment, we are exposed to additional international risks, including being subject to Indian securities laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with the requirements of the Stock Exchange Board of India, the stock exchanges upon which MphasiS is listed or any of the other applicable Indian regulatory authorities, our investment in MphasiS could be materially adversely affected, and such violation could result in significant legal consequences to us. 7 Our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We cannot be sure that our services and products, or the products of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us. These claims may harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or products. We generally agree in our contracts to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities they may incur resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area, whether we ultimately win or lose, could be time-consuming and costly, injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. We may, in limited cases, be required to forego rights to the use of intellectual property we help create, which limits our ability to also provide that intellectual property to other clients. Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or product could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects. A material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse affect on us. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be adversely impacted, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and our business and stock price could be adversely affected. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The statements in this Report that are not historical statements are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding estimated revenues, earnings, free cash flow, total contract value ("TCV") of new contract signings, operating margins and other forward-looking financial information. In addition, we have made in the past and may make in the future other written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future financial and operating performance (including revenue, earnings, free cash flow and operating margins), future cost savings, the timing of the revenue, earnings and free cash flow impact of new and existing contracts, liquidity, future revenues from new or existing clients, the TCV of new contract signings, business pipeline, industry growth rates and our performance relative thereto, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and the impact of client bankruptcies. Any forward-looking statement may rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and be subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. In addition to the factors outlined above, these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the performance of current and future client contracts in accordance with our cost, revenue and cash flow estimates, including our ability to achieve any operational efficiencies in our estimates; for contracts with U.S. federal government clients, including our NMCI contract, the government's ability to cancel the contract or impose additional terms and conditions due to changes in government funding, deployment schedules, military action or otherwise; our ability to access the capital markets, including our ability to obtain capital leases, surety bonds and letters of credit; the impact of third-party benchmarking provisions in certain client contracts; the impact on a historical and prospective basis of accounting rules and pronouncements; the impact of claims, litigation and governmental investigations; the success of our cost-cutting initiatives and the timing and amount of any resulting benefits; the impact of acquisitions and divestitures; a reduction in the carrying value of our assets; the impact of a bankruptcy or financial difficulty of a significant client on the financial and other terms of our agreements with that client; with respect to the funding of pension plan obligations, the performance of our investments relative to our assumed rate of return; changes in tax laws and interpretations and failure to obtain treaty relief from double taxation; failure to obtain or protect intellectual property rights; fluctuations in foreign currency, exchange rates and interest rates; the impact of competition on pricing, revenues and margins; and the degree to which third parties continue to outsource IT and business processes. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
