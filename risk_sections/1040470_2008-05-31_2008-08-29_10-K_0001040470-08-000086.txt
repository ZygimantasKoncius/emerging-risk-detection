Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below. These risks are not the only risks that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected which could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this annual report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Our operating results could be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, quarterly net sales have been as low as $4.6 million and as high as $10.9 million, and gross margins for quarterly net sales have fluctuated between 40.2% and 58.3%. Our future operating results will depend upon a variety of factors, including sales volume, the timing of significant orders, the mix of products sold, changes in pricing by us, our competitors, customers or suppliers, the length of sales cycles for our products, timing of new product announcements and releases by us and our competitors, market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products, capital spending patterns by customers, manufacturing inefficiencies associated with our new 9 product introductions, our ability to produce systems and products in volume and meet customer requirements, product returns and customer acceptance of product shipments, volatility in our targeted markets, political and economic instability, natural disasters, regulatory changes, possible disruptions caused by expanding existing facilities or moving into new facilities, expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances, and various competitive factors, including price-based competition, competition from vendors employing other technologies, and the amount of products sold under volume purchase arrangements, which tend to have lower selling prices. Accordingly, past performance may not be indicative of future performance. We depend on shipment and order size and timing. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems which typically range in purchase price from approximately $300,000 to over $1 million per system. As a result, the loss or deferral of a limited number of system sales could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating results in a particular period. All customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited penalties, and, therefore, backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. From time to time, cancellations and rescheduling of customer orders have occurred, and delays by our suppliers in providing components or subassemblies to us have caused delays in our shipments of our own products. There can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected by future cancellations and rescheduling. A substantial portion of net sales typically are realized near the end of each quarter. A delay or reduction in shipments near the end of a particular quarter, due, for example, to unanticipated shipment rescheduling, cancellations or deferrals by customers, customer credit issues, unexpected manufacturing difficulties experienced by us, or delays in deliveries by suppliers, could cause net sales in a particular quarter to fall significantly below our expectations. We rely on continued market acceptance for our FOX system, and may not be successful in attracting new or maintaining our existing customers. A principal element of our business strategy is to capture an increasing share of the test equipment market through sales of our FOX wafer-level test and burn-in system. The FOX system is newly designed to simultaneously burn-in and functionally test all of the die on a wafer. The market for the FOX systems is in the very early stages of development. Market acceptance of the FOX system is subject to a number of risks. Before a customer will incorporate the FOX system into a production line, lengthy qualification and correlation tests must be performed. We anticipate that potential customers may be reluctant to change their procedures in order to transfer burn-in and test functions to the FOX system. Initial purchases are expected to be limited to systems used for these qualifications and for engineering studies. Market acceptance of the FOX system also may be affected by a reluctance of IC manufacturers to rely on relatively small suppliers such as the Company. As is common with new complex products incorporating leading-edge technologies, we may encounter reliability, design and manufacturing issues as we begin volume production and initial installations of FOX systems at customer sites. The failure of the FOX system to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our future operating results, long-term prospects and our stock price. In future periods, we may rely on market acceptance for our ABTS system and we may not be able to achieve sufficient market acceptance to allow our ABTS system to be commercially viable. In June 2008, we announced shipment of an ABTS beta site system to Integrated Service Technology in Taiwan. Market acceptance of the ABTS system is subject to a number of risks. In order for our ABTS system to become commercially accepted, we must complete engineering development of necessary hardware and software. In addition, the first system, ordered by Integrated Service Technology, must successfully complete customer acceptance. Other customers must then be found who are willing to place orders for ABTS systems in sufficient quantities to allow it to be produced economically. To date, a limited number of customers have ordered MTX systems and it may not achieve broad market acceptance. Through the end of fiscal 2008, several companies purchased evaluation units of the MTX system, but only four customers have purchased production quantities. There are no long-term volume purchase commitments with any of these customers. There can be no assurance that these customers will again purchase MTX systems for their production facilities. Since most potential customers have successfully relied on memory testers for many years and their personnel understand the use and maintenance of such systems, we anticipate that they may be reluctant to change their procedures to transfer test functions to the MTX system. Before a customer will transfer test functions to the MTX, the test programs must be translated for use with the MTX system and lengthy correlation tests must be performed. Correlation testing may take up to six months or more. Furthermore, MTX system sales are expected to be primarily limited to new facilities and to existing facilities being upgraded to accommodate new product generations, such as the transition to new 10 memory technologies, including newer generation flash memories, the Double Data Rate DRAMs, and DDR II DRAMs. Construction of new facilities and upgrades of existing facilities have in some cases been delayed or canceled during periodic semiconductor industry downturns. Other companies have purchased MTX systems which are being used only in quality assurance and engineering applications. If we are unable to achieve broad market acceptance for our MTX system, our future prospects and future results of operations will be significantly harmed. Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, which may harm our ability to forecast demand and our future operating performance. Sales of our systems depend, in significant part, upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity or to restructure current manufacturing facilities, either of which typically involves a significant commitment of capital. In addition, the approval process for FOX and MTX systems and DiePak carrier sales may require lengthy qualification and correlation testing. In view of the significant investment or strategic issues that may be involved in a decision to purchase FOX and MTX systems or DiePak carriers, we may experience delays following initial qualification of our systems as a result of delays in a customer's approval process. For these reasons, our systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which we may expend substantial funds and management effort in securing a sale. Lengthy sales cycles subject us to a number of significant risks, including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results, over which we have little or no control. The loss of individual orders due to the lengthy sales and evaluation cycle, or delays in the sale of even a limited number of systems impairs our ability to plan future operating levels and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and, in particular, could contribute to significant fluctuations in operating results on a quarterly basis. Our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales and operations. Approximately 61.3%, 42.4% and 85.0% of our net sales for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were attributable to sales to customers for delivery outside of the United States. We operate sales, service and limited manufacturing organizations in Japan and Germany and a sales and support organization in Taiwan. We expect that sales of products for delivery outside of the United States will continue to represent a substantial portion of our future revenues. Our future performance will depend, in significant part, upon our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets which in turn will depend, in part, upon a continuation of current trade relations between the United States and foreign countries in which semiconductor manufacturers or assemblers have operations. A change toward more protectionist trade legislation in either the United States or such foreign countries, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. In addition, we are subject to other risks associated with doing business internationally, including longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection, the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, difficulty in staffing and managing global operations, risks of civil disturbance or other events which may limit or disrupt markets, international exchange restrictions, changing political conditions and monetary policies of foreign governments. A substantial portion of our net sales has been in Asia. Turmoil in the Asian financial markets has resulted, and may result in the future, in dramatic currency devaluations, stock market declines, restriction of available credit and general financial weakness. In addition, flash, DRAM, and other memory device prices in Asia have recently declined dramatically, and will likely do so again in the future. These developments may affect us in several ways. We believes that many international semiconductor manufacturers limited their capital spending in fiscal year 2008, and that the uncertainty of the memory market may cause some manufacturers in the future to again delay capital spending plans. The economic conditions in Asia may also affect the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations, resulting in cancellations or deferrals of existing orders and the limitation of additional orders. In addition, Asian governments have subsidized some portion of fabrication construction. Financial turmoil may reduce these governments' willingness to continue such subsidies. Such developments could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Approximately 49.3%, 49.1% and 1.6% of our net sales for fiscal 2008 were denominated in U.S. Dollars, Japanese Yen and Euros, respectively. Although a large percentage of net sales to European customers is denominated in U.S. Dollars, substantially all sales to Japanese customers are denominated in Yen. Because a substantial portion of our net sales is from sales of products for delivery outside the United States, an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of our products compared to products sold by local companies in such markets. In addition, since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted, we are exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from the date a purchase order is received until payment is made. This exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent our foreign operations incur expenses in the local currency. To date, we have not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks. Our operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to other currencies. 11 Our industry is subject to rapid technological changes. It is important to introduce the new product in a timely manner. The semiconductor equipment industry is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements. Our ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon our ability to develop new products and to introduce these products at competitive prices and on a timely and cost- effective basis. Our success in developing new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors, including product selection, timely and efficient completion of product design, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, product performance in the field and effective sales and marketing. Because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales, new product decisions must anticipate both future demand and the technology that will be available to supply that demand. Furthermore, introductions of new and complex products typically involve a period in which design, engineering and reliability issues are identified and addressed by our suppliers and us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in selecting, developing, manufacturing and marketing new products that satisfy market demand. Any such failure would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of the complexity of our products, significant delays can occur between a product's introduction and the commencement of volume production of such product. We have experienced, from time to time, significant delays in the introduction of, and technical and manufacturing difficulties with, certain of its products and may experience delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new products. Our inability to complete new product development, or to manufacture and ship products in time to meet customer requirements would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may experience product delays and increased costs associated with new product introductions. As is common with new complex and software-intensive products, we have encountered reliability, design and manufacturing issues as we began volume production and initial installations of certain products at customer sites. Certain of these issues in the past have been related to components and subsystems supplied to us by third parties who have in some cases limited the ability of us to address such issues promptly. This process in the past required and in the future is likely to require us to incur un-reimbursed engineering expenses, and from time to time to experience larger than anticipated warranty claims and could result in product returns. In the early stages of product development, there can be no assurance that reliability, design and manufacturing issues will not be discovered or, that if such issues arise, they can be resolved to the customers' satisfaction or that the resolution of such problems will not cause us to incur significant development costs or warranty expenses or to lose significant sales opportunities. Future changes in semiconductor technologies may make our products obsolete. Future improvements in semiconductor design and manufacturing technology may reduce or eliminate the need for our products. For example, improvements in BIST technology, and improvements in conventional test systems, such as reduced cost or increased throughput, may significantly reduce or eliminate the market for one or more of our products. If we are not able to improve our products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in its markets, we may not be able to grow our business. Semiconductor business cycles are unreliable and there is always the risk of cancellations and rescheduling. Our operating results depend primarily upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, semiconductor contract assemblers and burn-in and test service companies worldwide, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. The semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in general, and the market for flash memories, DRAMs and other memory devices in particular, historically have been highly volatile and have experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns, which have had severe, negative effects on the semiconductor industry's demand for semiconductor capital equipment, including test and burn-in systems manufactured and marketed by the Company. These downturns and slowdowns have adversely affected our operating results in the past. In addition, the purchasing patterns of our customers are also highly cyclical because most customers purchase our products for use in new production facilities or for upgrading existing test lines for the introduction of next generation products. Construction of new facilities and upgrades of existing facilities have in some cases been delayed or canceled during the most recent semiconductor industry downturn. A large portion of our net sales is attributable to a few customers and therefore a reduction in purchases by one or more customers could materially adversely affect our financial results. There can be no assurance that the semiconductor industry will grow in the future at the same rates as it has grown historically. Any downturn or slowdown in the semiconductor industry would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, the need to maintain investment in research and development and to maintain customer service and support will limit our ability to reduce our expenses in response to any such downturn or slowdown period. 12 The semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry has historically been subject to a relatively high rate of purchase order cancellation by customers as compared to other high technology industry sectors. Manufacturing companies that are the customers of semiconductor equipment companies frequently revise, postpone and cancel capital facility expansion plans. In such cases, semiconductor equipment companies may experience a significant rate of cancellations and rescheduling of purchase orders. There can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected by future cancellations and rescheduling. Our stock price may vary. The price for our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. We believe that factors such as announcements of developments related to our business, fluctuations in our operating results, failure to meet securities analysts' expectations, general conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries and the worldwide economy, announcement of technological innovations, new systems or product enhancements by us or our competitors, fluctuations in the level of cooperative development funding, acquisitions, changes in governmental regulations, developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and changes in our relationships with customers and suppliers could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general, and the market for small capitalization and high technology stocks in particular, has experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Any future growth may strain our operations and may require us to incur additional expenses to support these expanded operations. If we are to be successful, we must expand our operations. Such expansion will place a significant strain on our administrative, operational and financial resources. Further, such expansion will result in a continuing increase in the responsibility placed upon management personnel and will require development or enhancement of operational, managerial and financial systems and controls. If we are unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected. We depend on our key personnel. We must attract and retain talented employees. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of Rhea Posedel, our Chief Executive Officer, as well as other executive officers and key employees. We do not maintain key person life insurance for our benefit on any of our personnel, and none of our employees is subject to a non- competition agreement with the Company. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or a group of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our future success will depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, management, sales and marketing personnel. There is a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it has become increasingly difficult for us to hire such personnel. Competition for such personnel in the semiconductor equipment industry is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Changes in management could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results. We may be subject to litigation relating to intellectual property infringement which would be time-consuming, expensive and a distraction to our business. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to practice our technologies and erode our competitive advantage, and our business and operating results could be harmed. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights, and there can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights, if challenged, will be upheld as valid. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, regardless of the outcome of the litigation. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of the patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us. There are no pending claims against us regarding infringement of any patents or other intellectual property rights of others. However, we may receive, in the future, communications from third parties asserting intellectual property claims against us. Such claims could include assertions that our products infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of third parties, requests for indemnification against such infringement or suggestions that we may be interested in acquiring a license from such third parties. There can be no assurance that any such claim made in the future will not result in litigation, which could involve significant expense to us, and, if we are required or deem it appropriate to obtain a license 13 relating to one or more products or technologies, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We are subject to environment regulations. Federal, state and local regulations impose various controls on the use, storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used in our operations. We believe that our activities conform in all material respects to current environmental and land use regulations applicable to our operations and our current facilities, and that it has obtained environmental permits necessary to conduct its business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations. Such regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure by us to control the use, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities. We are subject to internal control evaluation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a report of management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control, or our independent registered public accounting firm does not timely deliver an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the public's perception may decline. Our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning in fiscal 2010. 14 MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY The directors of the Company are elected annually.
