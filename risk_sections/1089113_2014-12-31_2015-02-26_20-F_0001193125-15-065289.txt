Risk factors include loan portfolio growth, product mix, unemployment rates, bankruptcy trends, geographical concentrations, loan product features, economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets, the level of interest rates, portfolio seasoning, account management policies and practices, changes in laws and regulations, and other influences on customer payment patterns. Different factors are applied in different regions and countries to reflect local economic conditions, laws and regulations. The methodology and the assumptions used in calculating impairment losses are reviewed regularly in the light of differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. For example, roll rates, loss rates and the expected timing of future recoveries are regularly benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they remain appropriate. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 349 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) For individually assessed loans, judgement is required in determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred and, if so, the measurement of the impairment allowance. In determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred, judgement is exercised in evaluating all relevant information on indicators of impairment, including the consideration of whether payments are contractually past-due and the consideration of other factors indicating deterioration in the financial condition and outlook of borrowers affecting their ability to pay. A higher level of judgement is required for loans to borrowers showing signs of financial difficulty in market sectors experiencing economic stress, particularly where the likelihood of repayment is affected by the prospects for refinancing or the sale of a specified asset. For those loans where objective evidence of impairment exists, management determine the size of the allowance required based on a range of factors such as the realisable value of security, the likely dividend available on liquidation or bankruptcy, the viability of the customers business model and the capacity to trade successfully out of financial difficulties and generate sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations. HSBC might provide loan forbearance to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by agreeing to modify the contractual payment terms of loans in order to improve the management of customer relationships, maximise collection opportunities or avoid default or repossession. Where forbearance activities are significant, higher levels of judgement and estimation uncertainty are involved in determining their effects on loan impairment allowances. Judgements are involved in differentiating the credit risk characteristics of forbearance cases, including those which return to performing status following renegotiation. Where collectively assessed loan portfolios include significant levels of loan forbearance, portfolios are segmented to reflect their specific credit risk characteristics, and estimates are made of the incurred losses inherent within each forbearance portfolio segment. Forbearance activities take place in both retail and wholesale loan portfolios, but our largest concentration is in the US, in HSBC Finances CML portfolio. The exercise of judgement requires the use of assumptions which are highly subjective and very sensitive to the risk factors, in particular to changes in economic and credit conditions across a large number of geographical areas. Many of the factors have a high degree of interdependency and there is no single factor to which our loan impairment allowances as a whole are sensitive, though they are particularly sensitive to general economic and credit conditions in North America. For example, a 10% increase in impairment allowances on collectively assessed loans and advances in North America would have increased loan impairment allowances by US$0.2bn at 31 December 2014 (2013: US$0.4bn). Impairment of loans and advances Losses for impaired loans are recognised when there is objective evidence that impairment of a loan or portfolio of loans has occurred. Impairment allowances that are calculated on individual loans or on groups of loans assessed collectively, are recorded as charges to the income statement and are recorded against the carrying amount of impaired loans on the balance sheet. Losses which may arise from future events are not recognised. Individually assessed loans and advances The factors considered in determining whether a loan is individually significant for the purposes of assessing impairment include the size of the loan, the number of loans in the portfolio, and the importance of the individual loan relationship, and how this is managed. Loans that meet these criteria will be individually assessed for impairment, except when volumes of defaults and losses are sufficient to justify treatment under a collective assessment methodology (see below). Loans considered as individually significant are typically to corporate and commercial customers, are for larger amounts and are managed on an individual basis. For these loans, HSBC considers on a case-by-case basis at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a loan is impaired. The criteria used to make this assessment include:  known cash flow difficulties experienced by the borrower;  contractual payments of either principal or interest being past due for more than 90 days;  the probability that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial realisation;  a concession granted to the borrower for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty that results in forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest or fees, where the concession is not insignificant; and  there has been deterioration in the financial condition or outlook of the borrower such that its ability to repay is considered doubtful. For loans where objective evidence of impairment exists, impairment losses are determined considering the following factors:  HSBCs aggregate exposure to the customer;  the viability of the customers business model and their capacity to trade successfully out of financial difficulties and generate sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations;  the amount and timing of expected receipts and recoveries;  the likely dividend available on liquidation or bankruptcy;  the extent of other creditors commitments ranking ahead of, or pari passu with, HSBC and the likelihood of other creditors continuing to support the company;  the complexity of determining the aggregate amount and ranking of all creditor claims and the extent to which legal and insurance uncertainties are evident;  the realisable value of security (or other credit mitigants) and likelihood of successful repossession;  the likely costs of obtaining and selling collateral as part of foreclosure;  the ability of the borrower to obtain, and make payments in, the currency of the loan if not denominated in local currency; and  when available, the secondary market price of the debt. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 350 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) The determination of the realisable value of security is based on the market value at the time the impairment assessment is performed. The value is not adjusted for expected future changes in market prices, though adjustments are made to reflect local conditions such as forced sale discounts. Impairment losses are calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows of a loan, which includes expected future receipts of contractual interest, at the loans original effective interest rate and comparing the resultant present value with the loans current carrying amount. The impairment allowances on individually significant accounts are reviewed at least quarterly and more regularly when circumstances require. Collectively assessed loans and advances Impairment is assessed collectively to cover losses which have been incurred but have not yet been identified on loans subject to individual assessment or for homogeneous groups of loans that are not considered individually significant. Retail lending portfolios are generally assessed for impairment collectively as the portfolios are generally large homogeneous loan pools. Incurred but not yet identified impairment Individually assessed loans for which no evidence of impairment has been specifically identified on an individual basis are grouped together according to their credit risk characteristics for a collective impairment assessment. These credit risk characteristics may include country of origination, type of business involved, type of products offered, security obtained or other relevant factors. This assessment captures impairment losses that HSBC has incurred as a result of events occurring before the balance sheet date, which HSBC is not able to identify on an individual loan basis, and that can be reliably estimated. When information becomes available which identifies losses on individual loans within the group, those loans are removed from the group and assessed individually. The collective impairment allowance is determined after taking into account:  historical loss experience in portfolios of similar credit risk characteristics (for example, by industry sector, loan grade or product);  the estimated period between impairment occurring and the loss being identified and evidenced by the establishment of an appropriate allowance against the individual loan; and  managements judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual level of inherent losses at the balance sheet date is likely to be greater or less than that suggested by historical experience. The period between a loss occurring and its identification is estimated by management for each identified portfolio based on economic and market conditions, customer behaviour, portfolio management information, credit management techniques and collection and recovery experiences in the market. As it is assessed empirically on a periodic basis, the estimated period may vary over time as these factors change. Homogeneous groups of loans and advances Statistical methods are used to determine collective impairment losses for homogeneous groups of loans not considered individually significant. Losses in these groups of loans are recorded individually when individual loans are removed from the group and written off. The methods that are used to calculate collective allowances are:  When appropriate empirical information is available, HSBC utilises roll-rate methodology, which employs statistical analyses of historical data and experience of delinquency and default to reliably estimate the amount of the loans that will eventually be written off as a result of the events occurring before the balance sheet date but which HSBC is not able to identify individually. Individual loans are grouped using ranges of past due days; statistical analysis is then used to estimate the likelihood that loans in each range will progress through the various stages of delinquency and become irrecoverable. Additionally, individual loans are segmented based on their credit characteristics as described above. In applying this methodology, adjustments are made to estimate the periods of time between a loss event occurring and its discovery, for example through a missed payment, (known as the emergence period) and the period of time between discovery and write-off (known as the outcome period). Current economic conditions are also evaluated when calculating the appropriate level of allowance required to cover inherent loss. In certain highly developed markets, sophisticated models also take into account behavioural and account management trends as revealed in, for example, bankruptcy and rescheduling statistics.  When the portfolio size is small or when information is insufficient or not reliable enough to adopt a roll-rate methodology, HSBC adopts a basic formulaic approach based on historical loss rate experience, or a discounted cash flow model. Where a basic formulaic approach is undertaken, the period between a loss event occurring and its identification is explicitly estimated by local management, and is typically between six and twelve months. The inherent loss within each portfolio is assessed on the basis of statistical models using historical data observations, which are updated periodically to reflect recent portfolio and economic trends. When the most recent trends arising from changes in economic, regulatory or behavioural conditions are not fully reflected in the statistical models, they are taken into account by adjusting the impairment allowances derived from the statistical models to reflect these changes as at the balance sheet date. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 351 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Write-off of loans and advances Loans (and the related impairment allowance accounts) are normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where loans are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of security. In circumstances where the net realisable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write-off may be earlier. Reversals of impairment If the amount of an impairment loss decreases in a subsequent period, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the excess is written back by reducing the loan impairment allowance account accordingly. The write-back is recognised in the income statement. Assets acquired in exchange for loans Non-financial assets acquired in exchange for loans as part of an orderly realisation are recorded as Assets held for sale and reported in Other assets if those assets are classified as held for sale. The asset acquired is recorded at the lower of its fair value less costs to sell and the carrying amount of the loan (net of impairment allowance) at the date of exchange. No depreciation is charged in respect of assets held for sale. Impairments and reversal of previous impairments are recognised in the income statement in Other operating income, together with any realised gains or losses on disposal. Renegotiated loans Loans subject to collective impairment assessment whose terms have been renegotiated are no longer considered past due, but are treated as up to date loans for measurement purposes once a minimum number of payments required have been received. They are segregated from other parts of the loan portfolio for the purposes of collective impairment assessment, to reflect their risk profile. Loans subject to individual impairment assessment, whose terms have been renegotiated, are subject to ongoing review to determine whether they remain impaired. The carrying amounts of loans that have been classified as renegotiated retain this classification until maturity or derecognition. A loan that is renegotiated is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement made on substantially different terms or if the terms of an existing agreement are modified such that the renegotiated loan is substantially a different financial instrument. Any new agreements arising due to derecognition events will continue to be disclosed as renegotiated loans and are assessed for impairment as above. Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are assessed at each balance sheet date for objective evidence of impairment. If such evidence exists as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset (a loss event) and that loss event has an impact which can be reliably measured on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset an impairment loss is recognised. If the available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost (net of any principal repayments and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any previous impairment loss recognised in the income statement, is recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement within Loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions for debt instruments and within Gains less losses from financial investments for equities. The impairment methodologies for available-for-sale financial assets are set out in more detail below:  Available-for-sale debt securities. In assessing objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date, HSBC considers all available evidence, including observable data or information about events specifically relating to the securities which may result in a shortfall in the recovery of future cash flows. Financial difficulties of the issuer, as well as other factors such as information about the issuers liquidity, business and financial risk exposures, levels of and trends in default for similar financial assets, national and local economic trends and conditions, and the fair value of collateral and guarantees may be considered individually, or in combination, to determine if there is objective evidence of impairment. In addition, the performance of underlying collateral and the extent and depth of market price declines is relevant when assessing objective evidence of impairment of available-for-sale ABSs. The primary indicators of potential impairment are considered to be adverse fair value movements and the disappearance of an active market for a security, while changes in credit ratings are of secondary importance.  Available-for-sale equity securities. Objective evidence of impairment may include specific information about the issuer as detailed above, but may also include information about significant changes in technology, markets, economics or the law that provides evidence that the cost of the equity securities may not be recovered. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 352 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the equity below its cost is also objective evidence of impairment. In assessing whether it is significant, the decline in fair value is evaluated against the original cost of the asset at initial recognition. In assessing whether it is prolonged, the decline is evaluated against the continuous period in which the fair value of the asset has been below its original cost at initial recognition. Once an impairment loss has been recognised, the subsequent accounting treatment for changes in the fair value of that asset differs depending on the type of asset:  for an available-for-sale debt security, a subsequent decline in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in the income statement when there is further objective evidence of impairment as a result of further decreases in the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. Where there is no further objective evidence of impairment, the decline in the fair value of the financial asset is recognised in other comprehensive income. If the fair value of a debt security increases in a subsequent period, and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, or the instrument is no longer impaired, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement;  for an available-for-sale equity security, all subsequent increases in the fair value of the instrument are treated as a revaluation and are recognised in other comprehensive income. Impairment losses recognised on the equity security are not reversed through the income statement. Subsequent decreases in the fair value of the available-for-sale equity security are recognised in the income statement to the extent that further cumulative impairment losses have been incurred. (l) Funding fair value adjustment In line with evolving market practice HSBC revised its estimation methodology for valuing the uncollateralised derivative portfolios by introducing a funding fair value adjustment (FFVA). The FFVA adjustment reflects the estimated present value of the future market funding cost or benefit associated with funding uncollateralised derivative exposure at rates other than the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate, which is the benchmark rate used for valuing collateralised derivatives. The impact of FFVA adoption in 2014 was a US$263m reduction in net trading income, reflecting the incorporation of a funding spread over Libor. Further details have been provided in Note 13 to the Financial Statements. (m) Operating income Interest income and expense Interest income and expense for all financial instruments except for those classified as held for trading or designated at fair value (except for debt securities issued by HSBC and derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt securities) are recognised in Interest income and Interest expense in the income statement using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. Non-interest income and expense Fee income is earned from a diverse range of services provided by HSBC to its customers. Fee income is accounted for as follows:  income earned on the execution of a significant act is recognised as revenue when the act is completed (for example, fees arising from negotiating or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party, such as an arrangement for the acquisition of shares or other securities);  income earned from the provision of services is recognised as revenue as the services are provided (for example, asset management, portfolio and other management advisory and service fees); and  income which forms an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument is recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate (for example, certain loan commitment fees) and recorded in Interest income. Net trading income comprises all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading, together with the related interest income, expense and dividends. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. This is the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and usually the date when shareholders have approved the dividend for unlisted equity securities. The accounting policies for net income/(expense) from financial instruments designated at fair value and for net insurance premium income are disclosed in Note 2 and Note 3. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 353 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 2 Net income/(expense) from financial instruments designated at fair value Accounting policy Net income/(expense) from financial instruments designated at fair value includes:  all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, including liabilities under investment contracts;  all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are managed in conjunction with financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss; and  interest income, interest expense and dividend income in respect of financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss; and derivatives managed in conjunction with the above, except for interest arising from debt securities issued by HSBC and derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt securities, which is recognised in Interest expense.

The cost of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of equity instruments on the date they are granted and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to Retained earnings. For cash-settled share-based payment arrangements, the services acquired and liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability and recognised as the employees render service. Until settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. Fair value is determined by using appropriate valuation models. Vesting conditions include service conditions and performance conditions; any other features of the arrangement are non-vesting conditions. Market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the award at the date of grant. Vesting conditions, other than market performance conditions, are not taken into account in the initial estimate of the fair value at the grant date. They are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction. A cancellation that occurs during the vesting period is treated as an acceleration of vesting, and recognised immediately for the amount that would otherwise have been recognised for services over the vesting period. Where HSBC Holdings enters into share-based payment arrangements involving employees of subsidiaries for which the subsidiaries are re-charged, the difference between the cost of the share-based payment arrangement and the fair value of the equity instruments expected to be issued to satisfy those arrangements is recognised as an adjustment to Investment in subsidiaries over the vesting period.

Post-employment benefit plans Accounting policy HSBC operates a number of pension and other post-employment benefit plans throughout the world. These plans include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans and various other post-employment benefits such as post-employment healthcare. Payments to defined contribution plans and state-managed retirement benefit plans, where HSBCs obligations under the plans are equivalent to a defined contribution plan, are charged as an expense as the employees render service. The defined benefit pension costs and the present value of defined benefit obligations are calculated at the reporting date by the schemes actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The net charge to the income statement mainly comprises the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability and is presented in operating expenses. The past service cost, which is charged immediately to the income statement, is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods resulting from a plan amendment (the introduction or withdrawal of, or changes to, a defined benefit plan) or curtailment (a significant reduction by the entity in the number of employees covered by a plan). A settlement is a transaction that eliminates all further legal and constructive obligations for part or all of the benefits provided under a defined benefit plan, other than a payment of benefits to, or on behalf of, employees that is set out in the terms of the plan and included in the actuarial assumptions. Re-measurements of the net defined benefit asset or liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments (the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred), as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. The net defined benefit asset or liability represents the present value of defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets. Any net defined benefit surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan. The cost of obligations arising from other post-employment defined benefit plans, such as defined benefit health-care plans, are accounted for on the same basis as defined benefit pension plans.

These fees arise from services such as auditing mutual funds managed by HSBC and reviewing the financial position of corporate concerns which borrow from HSBC. Fees payable to KPMG for non-audit services for HSBC Holdings are not disclosed separately because such fees are disclosed on a consolidated basis for the HSBC Group. 8 Tax Accounting policy Income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in the same statement in which the related item appears. Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year, calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. HSBC provides for potential current tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when HSBC intends to settle on a net basis and the legal right to offset exists. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, and when HSBC has a legal right to offset. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 365 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Deferred tax relating to actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits is recognised in other comprehensive income. Deferred tax relating to share-based payment transactions is recognised directly in equity to the extent that the amount of the estimated future tax deduction exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense. Deferred tax relating to fair value re-measurements of available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedging instruments is charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognised in the income statement when the deferred fair value gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Deferred tax assets The recognition of a deferred tax asset relies on an assessment of the probability and sufficiency of future taxable profits, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. In absence of a history of taxable profits, the most significant judgements relate to expected future profitability and to the applicability of tax planning strategies, including corporate reorganisations. Our US operations have a history of tax losses, but profitability is expected to improve. Tax planning strategies support the recognition of deferred tax assets in the US, with retention of capital in the US operations being a significant factor in recognising the deferred tax assets. Given the recent occurrence of tax losses, the recognition of deferred tax assets in Brazil takes into consideration both the reliance placed on managements projection of income and on the use of strategies, such as corporate reorganisations and other initiatives, to improve the profitability of our Brazilian banking operations from a tax perspective.

The Hong Kong tax rate applying to the profits of subsidiaries assessable in Hong Kong was 16.5% (2013: 16.5%; 2012: 16.5%). Other overseas subsidiaries and overseas branches provided for taxation at the appropriate rates in the countries in which they operate.

The effective tax rate for the year reflected the recurring benefits from tax exempt income from government bonds and equities held by a number of Group entities and recognition of the Groups share of post-tax profits of associates and joint ventures within our pre-tax income, together with a current tax credit for prior periods offset in part by non-tax-deductible settlements and provision in connection with foreign exchange investigations. The effective tax rate in 2013 was lower because of benefits from non-taxable gains offset in part by a write-down of deferred tax assets. The main rate of corporation tax in the UK reduced from 23% to 21% on 1 April 2014 and will be further reduced to 20% on 1 April 2015. The reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20% was enacted through the 2013 Finance Act on 17 July 2013. It is not expected that the future rate reduction will have a significant effect on the Group. The Groups legal entities are subject to routine review and audit by tax authorities in the territories in which the Group operates. Where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain, the Group provides for potential tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. The amounts ultimately paid may differ materially from the amounts provided depending on the ultimate resolution of such matters. Deferred taxation The table overleaf shows the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet and the related amounts recognised in the income statement, other comprehensive income and directly in equity. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are different from the amounts disclosed in the table overleaf as they are presented after offsetting asset and liability balances where HSBC has the legal right to set-off and intends to settle on a net basis. The net deferred tax assets totalled US$5.6bn at 31 December 2014 (2013: US$6.5bn). The main items to note are: US The net deferred tax asset relating to HSBCs operations in the US was US$4.1bn (2013: US$4.4bn). The deferred tax assets included in this total reflected the carry forward of tax losses and tax credits of US$0.9bn (2013: US$0.7bn), deductible temporary differences in respect of loan impairment allowances of US$0.8bn (2013: US$1.2bn) and other temporary differences of US$2.4bn (2013: US$2.5bn). Deductions for loan impairments for US tax purposes generally occur when the impaired loan is charged off, or if earlier, when the impaired loan is sold. The tax deduction is often in the period subsequent to that in which the impairment is recognised for accounting purposes. As a result, the amount of the associated deferred tax asset should generally move in line with the impairment allowance balance. On the evidence available, including historical levels of profitability, management projections of future income and HSBC Holdings commitment to continue to retain sufficient capital in North America to recover the deferred tax asset, it is expected that there will be sufficient taxable income generated by the business to realise these assets. Management projections of profits from the US operations currently indicate that tax losses and tax credits will be fully recovered by 2017. The current level of the deferred tax asset in respect of loan impairment allowances and other deductible temporary differences is projected to reduce over the next four years. As there has been a recent history of losses in HSBCs US operations, managements analysis of the recognition of these deferred tax assets significantly discounts any future expected profits from the US operations and relies on capital support from HSBC Holdings, including tax planning strategies in relation to such support. The principal strategy involves generating future taxable profits through the retention of capital in the US in excess of normal regulatory requirements in order to reduce deductible funding expenses or otherwise deploy such capital to increase levels of taxable income. As financial performance in our US operations improves it is expected that projected future profits from US operations will be relied on in the evaluation of the recognition of the deferred tax asset in future periods as the sustainability of the improving financial performance is demonstrated. Brazil The net deferred tax asset relating to HSBCs operations in Brazil was US$1.3bn (2013: US$1.0bn). The deferred tax assets included in this total reflected the carry forward of tax losses of US$0.3bn (2013: US$0.1bn), deductible temporary differences in respect of loan impairment allowances of US$0.7bn (2013: US$0.7bn) and other temporary differences of US$0.3bn (2013: US$0.2bn). Deductions for loan impairments for Brazilian tax purposes generally occur when the impaired loan is charged off, often in the period subsequent to that in which the impairment is recognised for accounting purposes. As a result, the amount of the associated deferred tax asset should generally move in line with the impairment allowance balance. Management projections of profits from the Brazilian banking operations currently indicate that the tax losses and other temporary differences will be substantially recovered within the next five to eight years. Loan impairment deductions are recognised for tax purposes typically within two to three years of the accounting recognition. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 367 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Mexico The net deferred tax asset relating to HSBCs operations in Mexico was US$0.5bn (2013: US$0.5bn). The deferred tax assets included in this total related primarily to deductible temporary differences in respect of accounting provisions for impaired loans. Managements analysis of the recognition of these deferred tax assets relies on the primary strategy of selling certain loan portfolios, the losses on which are deductible for tax in Mexico when sold. Any such deductions for tax would lead to the reversal of the carried forward loan impairment provision recognised for deferred tax purposes. The deferred tax balances are carried forward to future years without expiry. In September 2013, the Mexican Government proposed a number of tax reforms that were approved by the Chamber of Senate in October 2013 and published in the Official Gazette in December 2013. The tax reforms included a new basis of tax deduction for loan impairment charges that will allow banks to recognise tax deductions as and when loans are written off the balance sheet. The reforms also brought in transitional rules to allow banks to continue to claim any unclaimed deductions as at 31 December 2013. On 4 July 2014, the Mexican Government issued rule I.3.22.5 of the Miscellaneous Tax Resolution that clarified the treatment of the transitional rules, but had no impact on the deferred tax assets held in our operations in Mexico. On the evidence available, including historical and projected levels of loan portfolio growth, loan impairment rates and profitability, it is expected that the business will realise these assets over the next five years. There were no material carried forward tax losses or tax credits recognised within the Groups deferred tax assets in Mexico. UK The net deferred tax liability relating to HSBCs operations in the UK was US$0.4bn (2013: asset of US$0.4bn). The deferred tax liabilities included in this total related primarily to retirement benefits. There were no material carried forward tax losses or tax credits recognised within the Groups deferred tax assets in the UK. Unrecognised deferred tax The amount of temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet was US$22.6bn (2013: US$22.0bn). These amounts included unused state losses arising in our US operations of US$14.1bn (2013: US$17.3bn). Of the total amounts unrecognised, US$4.2bn (2013: US$5.0bn) had no expiry date, US$0.9bn (2013: US$1.0bn) was scheduled to expire within 10 years and the remaining will expire after 10 years. Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Groups investments in subsidiaries and branches where remittance or other realisation is not probable, and for those associates and interests in joint ventures where it has been determined that no additional tax will arise. No amount is disclosed for the unrecognised deferred tax or the 2014 and 2013 temporary differences associated with such investments as it is impracticable to determine the amount of income taxes that would be payable when any temporary differences reverse. Deferred tax of US$132m (2013: US$20m) has, however, been provided in respect of distributable reserves of associates that, on distribution, would attract withholding tax.

HSBCs chief operating decision-maker is the Group Management Board (GMB) which operates as a general management committee under the direct authority of the Board. The GMB regularly reviews operating activity on a number of bases, including by geographical region and by global business. HSBC considers that geographical operating segments represent the most appropriate information for the users of the financial statements to best evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities in which HSBC engages, and the economic environments in which it operates. This reflects the importance of geographical factors on business strategy and performance, the allocation of capital resources, and the role of geographical regional management in executing strategy. As a result, HSBCs operating segments are considered to be geographical regions. Geographical information is classified by the location of the principal operations of the subsidiary or, for The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC Bank, HSBC Bank Middle East and HSBC Bank USA, by the location of the branch responsible for reporting the results or providing funding. Measurement of segmental assets, liabilities, income and expenses is in accordance with the Groups accounting policies. Segmental income and expenses include transfers between segments and these transfers are conducted at arms length. Shared costs are included in segments on the basis of the actual recharges made. The expense of the UK bank levy is included in the Europe geographical region as HSBC regards the levy as a cost of carrying on business and being headquartered in the UK. Products and services HSBC provides a comprehensive range of banking and related financial services to its customers in its five geographical regions. The products and services offered to customers are organised by global business.  Retail Banking and Wealth Management (RBWM) offers a broad range of products and services to meet the personal banking and wealth management needs of individual customers. Typically, customer offerings include personal banking products (current and savings accounts, mortgages and personal loans, credit cards, debit cards and local and international payment services) and wealth management services (insurance and investment products, global asset management services and financial planning services).  Commercial Banking (CMB) offers a broad range of products and services to serve the needs of our commercial customers, including small and medium-sized enterprises, mid-market enterprises and corporates. These include credit and lending, international trade and receivables finance, treasury management and liquidity solutions (payments and cash management and commercial cards), commercial insurance and investments. CMB also offers its customers access to products and services offered by other global businesses, for example Global Banking & Markets (GB&M), which include foreign exchange products, raising capital on debt and equity markets and advisory services. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 371 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued)  GB&M provides tailored financial solutions to major government, corporate and institutional clients and private investors worldwide. The client-focused business lines deliver a full range of banking capabilities including financing, advisory and transaction services, a markets business that provides services in credit, rates, foreign exchange, equities, money markets and securities services, and principal investment activities.  Global Private Banking (GPB) provides a range of services to high net worth individuals and families with complex and international needs within the Groups priority markets. Change in operating segments HSBCs operating segments are Europe, Asia, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), North America and Latin America. Previously, HSBCs operating segments were reported as Europe, Hong Kong, Rest of Asia-Pacific, Middle East and North Africa, North America and Latin America. Hong Kong and Rest of Asia-Pacific are no longer regarded as separate reportable operating segments, having considered the geographical financial information presented to the chief operating decision maker. From 1 January 2014, they have been replaced by a new operating segment, Asia, which better aligns with internal management information used for evaluation when making business decisions and resource allocations. The chief operating decision-maker continues to be the GMB and the basis for measuring segmental results has not changed. Comparative financial information has been re-presented accordingly. There has been no change in the underlying business operations comprising the Asia segment. Reported net operating income in Asia for the year to 31 December 2014 was US$23,677m (31 December 2013: US$24,432m; 31 December 2012: US$25,332m). This was US$713m lower (31 December 2013: US$749m lower; 31 December 2012: US$674m lower) than would be calculated by adding net operating income reported for Hong Kong and Rest of Asia-Pacific on an individual basis. The reduction in net operating income is offset by an equal decrease in operating expenses. The difference relates to shared service recharges and business activity undertaken between the two regions which form revenue or expense on an individual basis, but are eliminated as intra-segment activity when reported as Asia. There is no difference between profit before tax reported for Asia and that which would be calculated by adding the profit before tax of Hong Kong and Rest of Asia-Pacific on an individual basis.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 376 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 12 Trading assets Accounting policy Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term, or form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking. They are recognised on trade date, when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties, and are normally derecognised when sold. They are initially measured at fair value, with transaction costs taken to the income statement. Subsequent changes in their fair values are recognised in the income statement in Net trading income. For trading assets, the interest is shown in Net trading income.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 377 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 13 Fair values of financial instruments carried at fair value Accounting policy All financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is generally its transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received). However, sometimes the fair value will be based on other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, without modification or repackaging, or on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates. When such evidence exists, HSBC recognises a trading gain or loss at inception (day 1 gain or loss), being the difference between the transaction price and the fair value. When significant unobservable parameters are used, the entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and is recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction until the transaction matures, is closed out, the valuation inputs become observable or HSBC enters into an offsetting transaction. The fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on an individual basis. However, in cases where HSBC manages a group of financial assets and liabilities according to its net market or credit risk exposure, HSBC measures the fair value of the group of financial instruments on a net basis but presents the underlying financial assets and liabilities separately in the financial statements, unless they satisfy the IFRS offsetting criteria as described in Note 32. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Valuation of financial instruments The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded principal market. The fair values of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets are based on bid prices for assets held and offer prices for liabilities issued. Where a financial instrument has a quoted price in an active market, the fair value of the total holding of the financial instrument is calculated as the product of the number of units and quoted price. The judgement as to whether a market is active may include, but is not restricted to, the consideration of factors such as the magnitude and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid/offer spreads. The bid/offer spread represents the difference in prices at which a market participant would be willing to buy compared with the price at which they would be willing to sell. Valuation techniques may incorporate assumptions about factors that other market participants would use in their valuations, including:  the likelihood and expected timing of future cash flows on the instrument. Judgement may be required to assess the counterpartys ability to service the instrument in accordance with its contractual terms. Future cash flows may be sensitive to changes in market rates;  selecting an appropriate discount rate for the instrument. Judgement is required to assess what a market participant would regard as the appropriate spread of the rate for an instrument over the appropriate risk-free rate;  judgement to determine what model to use to calculate fair value in areas where the choice of valuation model is particularly subjective, for example, when valuing complex derivative products. A range of valuation techniques is employed, dependent on the instrument type and available market data. Most valuation techniques are based upon discounted cash flow analyses, in which expected future cash flows are calculated and discounted to present value using a discounting curve. Prior to considering credit risk, the expected future cash flows may be known, as would be the case for the fixed leg of an interest rate swap, or may be uncertain and require projection, as would be the case for the floating leg of an interest rate swap. Projection utilises market forward curves, if available. In option models, the probability of different potential future outcomes must be considered. In addition, the value of some products is dependent on more than one market factor, and in these cases it will typically be necessary to consider how movements in one market factor may affect the other market factors. The model inputs necessary to perform such calculations include interest rate yield curves, exchange rates, volatilities, correlations, prepayment and default rates. For interest rate derivatives with collateralised counterparties and in significant currencies, HSBC uses a discounting curve that reflects the overnight interest rate (OIS). The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data. However, certain financial instruments are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable, and for them the measurement of fair value is more judgemental. An instrument in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if, in the opinion of management, a significant proportion of the instruments inception profit or greater than 5% of the instruments valuation is driven by unobservable inputs. Unobservable in this context means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the price at which an arms length transaction would be likely to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value (consensus pricing data may, for example, be used). Control framework Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that they are either determined or validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. For all financial instruments where fair values are determined by reference to externally quoted prices or observable pricing inputs to models, independent price determination or validation is utilised. In inactive markets HSBC will source alternative market information to validate the financial instruments fair value, with greater weight given to information that is considered to be more relevant and reliable. The factors that are considered in this regard are, inter alia:  the extent to which prices may be expected to represent genuine traded or tradeable prices;  the degree of similarity between financial instruments;  the degree of consistency between different sources;  the process followed by the pricing provider to derive the data; HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 378 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued)  the elapsed time between the date to which the market data relates and the balance sheet date; and  the manner in which the data was sourced. For fair values determined using valuation models, the control framework may include, as applicable, development or validation by independent support functions of (i) the logic within valuation models; (ii) the inputs to those models; (iii) any adjustments required outside the valuation models; and (iv) where possible, model outputs. Valuation models are subject to a process of due diligence and calibration before becoming operational and are calibrated against external market data on an ongoing basis. Changes in fair value are generally subject to a profit and loss analysis process. This process disaggregates changes in fair value into three high level categories; (i) portfolio changes, such as new transactions or maturing transactions, (ii) market movements, such as changes in foreign exchange rates or equity prices, and (iii) other, such as changes in fair value adjustments (see further below). The majority of financial instruments measured at fair value are in GB&M. GB&Ms fair value governance structure is illustrated below as an example: Financial liabilities measured at fair value In certain circumstances, HSBC records its own debt in issue at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market for the specific instrument concerned, where available. An example of this is where own debt in issue is hedged with interest rate derivatives. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for which are either based upon quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument, or are estimated by comparison with quoted prices in an active market for similar instruments. In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of applying the credit spread which is appropriate to HSBCs liabilities. The change in fair value of issued debt securities attributable to the Groups own credit spread is computed as follows: for each security at each reporting date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using credit spreads for similar securities for the same issuer. Then, using discounted cash flow, each security is valued using a Libor-based discount curve. The difference in the valuations is attributable to the Groups own credit spread. This methodology is applied consistently across all securities. Structured notes issued and certain other hybrid instrument liabilities are included within trading liabilities and are measured at fair value. The credit spread applied to these instruments is derived from the spreads at which HSBC issues structured notes. Gains and losses arising from changes in the credit spread of liabilities issued by HSBC reverse over the contractual life of the debt, provided that the debt is not repaid at a premium or a discount. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 379 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Fair value hierarchy Fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined according to the following hierarchy:  Level 1  valuation technique using quoted market price: financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets that HSBC can access at the measurement date.  Level 2  valuation technique using observable inputs: financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.  Level 3  valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs: financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable. The following table sets out the financial instruments by fair value hierarchy.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 380 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Fair value adjustments Fair value adjustments are adopted when HSBC considers that there are additional factors that would be considered by a market participant which are not incorporated within the valuation model. HSBC classifies fair value adjustments as either risk-related or model-related. The majority of these adjustments relate to GB&M. Movements in the level of fair value adjustments do not necessarily result in the recognition of profits or losses within the income statement. For example, as models are enhanced, fair value adjustments may no longer be required. Similarly, fair value adjustments will decrease when the related positions are unwound, but this may not result in profit or loss. Global Banking and Markets fair value adjustments 2014 2013 US$m US$m Type of adjustment Risk-related 1,958 1,565  bid-offer 539 561  uncertainty 357 343  credit valuation adjustment 871 1,274  debit valuation adjustment (270 ) (616 )  funding fair value adjustment 460   other 1 3 Model-related 57 202  model limitation 52 199  other 5 3 Inception profit (Day 1 P&L reserves) (Note 16) 114 167 At 31 December 2,129 1,934 The largest change in recurring fair value adjustments was a decline of US$403m in respect of the credit valuation adjustment, as a result of both reduced derivative counterparty exposures and general narrowing of credit default swap (CDS) spreads. Narrowing HSBC credit default swap spreads similarly contributed to a reduction in the debit valuation adjustment (DVA) of US$346m. Funding fair value adjustment (FFVA) reflects the potential future cost or benefit of funding the uncollateralised derivative portfolio at rates other than overnight (OIS) rates. The impact of FFVA adoption in 2014 was a US$263m reduction in net trading income, reflecting the incorporation of a funding spread over Libor. FFVA is measured from an OIS base, and the total FFVA balance of US$460m also reflects the difference between OIS and Libor which had been previously reflected in the fair value of the uncollateralised derivative portfolio. Risk-related adjustments Bid-offer IFRS 13 requires use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value. Valuation models will typically generate mid-market values. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs would be incurred if substantially all residual net portfolio market risks were closed using available hedging instruments or by disposing of or unwinding the position. Uncertainty Certain model inputs may be less readily determinable from market data, and/or the choice of model itself may be more subjective. In these circumstances, there exists a range of possible values that the financial instrument or market parameter may assume and an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the likelihood that in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument, market participants would adopt more conservative values for uncertain parameters and/or model assumptions than those used in the valuation model. Credit valuation adjustment The CVA is an adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect within fair value the possibility that the counterparty may default and that HSBC may not receive the full market value of the transactions (see below). Debit valuation adjustment The DVA is an adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect within fair value the possibility that HSBC may default, and that HSBC may not pay full market value of the transactions (see below). HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 381 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Funding fair value adjustment The funding fair value adjustment is calculated by applying future market funding spreads to the expected future funding exposure of any uncollateralised component of the OTC derivative portfolio. This includes the uncollateralised component of collateralised derivatives in addition to derivatives that are fully uncollateralised. The expected future funding exposure is calculated by a simulation methodology, where available. The expected future funding exposure is adjusted for events that may terminate the exposure such as the default of HSBC or the counterparty. The funding fair value adjustment and debit valuation adjustment are calculated independently. Model-related adjustments Model limitation Models used for portfolio valuation purposes may be based upon a simplifying set of assumptions that do not capture all material market characteristics. Additionally, markets evolve, and models that were adequate in the past may require development to capture all material market characteristics in current market conditions. In these circumstances, model limitation adjustments are adopted. As model development progresses, model limitations are addressed within the valuation models and a model limitation adjustment is no longer needed. Inception profit (Day 1 P&L reserves) Inception profit adjustments are adopted when the fair value estimated by a valuation model is based on one or more significant unobservable inputs. The accounting for inception profit adjustments is discussed on page 378. An analysis of the movement in the deferred Day 1 P&L reserve is provided on page 395. Credit valuation adjustment/debit valuation adjustment methodology HSBC calculates a separate CVA and DVA for each HSBC legal entity, and within each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure. HSBC calculates the CVA by applying the probability of default (PD) of the counterparty, conditional on the non-default of HSBC, to HSBCs expected positive exposure to the counterparty and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. Conversely, HSBC calculates the DVA by applying the PD of HSBC, conditional on the non-default of the counterparty, to the expected positive exposure of the counterparty to HSBC and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. Both calculations are performed over the life of the potential exposure. For most products HSBC uses a simulation methodology to calculate the expected positive exposure to a counterparty. This incorporates a range of potential exposures across the portfolio of transactions with the counterparty over the life of the portfolio. The simulation methodology includes credit mitigants such as counterparty netting agreements and collateral agreements with the counterparty. A standard loss given default (LGD) assumption of 60% is generally adopted for developed market exposures, and 75% for emerging market exposures. Alternative LGD assumptions may be adopted when both the nature of the exposure and the available data support this. For certain types of exotic derivatives where the products are not currently supported by the simulation, or for derivative exposures in smaller trading locations where the simulation tool is not yet available, HSBC adopts alternative methodologies. These may involve mapping to the results for similar products from the simulation tool or, where the mapping approach is not appropriate, using a simplified methodology which generally follows the same principles as the simulation methodology. The calculation is applied at a trade level, with more limited recognition of credit mitigants such as netting or collateral agreements than is used in the simulation methodology. The methodologies do not, in general, account for wrong-way risk. Wrong-way risk arises when the underlying value of the derivative prior to any CVA is positively correlated to the probability of default by the counterparty. When there is significant wrong-way risk, a trade-specific approach is applied to reflect the wrong-way risk within the valuation. With the exception of certain central clearing parties, we include all third-party counterparties in the CVA and DVA calculations and do not net these adjustments across Group entities. We review and refine the CVA and DVA methodologies on an ongoing basis. Valuation of uncollateralised derivatives Historically, HSBC has valued uncollateralised derivatives by discounting expected future cash flows at a benchmark interest rate, typically Libor or its equivalent. In line with evolving industry practice, HSBC changed this approach in the second half of 2014. HSBC now views the OIS curve as the base discounting curve for all derivatives, both collateralised and uncollateralised, and has adopted an FFVA to reflect the funding of uncollateralised derivative exposure at rates other than OIS. The impact of adopting the funding fair value adjustment was a reduction in trading revenues of US$263m. This is an area in which a full industry consensus has not yet emerged. HSBC will continue to monitor industry evolution and refine the calculation methodology as necessary.

Level 3 instruments are present in both ongoing and legacy businesses. Loans held for securitisation, derivatives with monolines, certain other derivatives and predominantly all Level 3 asset-backed securities are legacy. HSBC has the capability to hold these positions. Private equity including strategic investments HSBCs private equity and strategic investments are generally classified as available for sale and are not traded in active markets. In the absence of an active market, an investments fair value is estimated on the basis of an analysis of the investees financial position and results, risk profile, prospects and other factors, as well as by reference to market valuations for similar entities quoted in an active market, or the price at which similar companies have changed ownership. Asset-backed securities While quoted market prices are generally used to determine the fair value of these securities, valuation models are used to substantiate the reliability of the limited market data available and to identify whether any adjustments to quoted market prices are required. For ABSs including residential MBSs, the valuation uses an industry standard model and the assumptions relating to prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity based on collateral type, and performance, as appropriate. The valuations output is benchmarked for consistency against observable data for securities of a similar nature. Loans, including leveraged finance and loans held for securitisation Loans held at fair value are valued from broker quotes and/or market data consensus providers when available. In the absence of an observable market, the fair value is determined using alternative valuation techniques. These techniques include discounted cash flow models, which incorporate assumptions regarding an appropriate credit spread for the loan, derived from other market instruments issued by the same or comparable entities. Structured notes The fair value of structured notes valued using a valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs is derived from the fair value of the underlying debt security, and the fair value of the embedded derivative is determined as described in the paragraph below on derivatives. Level 3 structured notes principally comprise equity-linked notes which are issued by HSBC and provide the counterparty with a return that is linked to the performance of certain equity securities, and other portfolios. The notes are classified as Level 3 due to the unobservability of parameters such as long-dated equity volatilities and correlations between equity prices, between equity prices and interest rates and between interest rates and foreign exchange rates. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 383 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Derivatives OTC (i.e. non-exchange traded) derivatives are valued using valuation models. Valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based upon no-arbitrage principles. For many vanilla derivative products, such as interest rate swaps and European options, the modelling approaches used are standard across the industry. For more complex derivative products, there may be some differences in market practice. Inputs to valuation models are determined from observable market data wherever possible, including prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing. Certain inputs may not be observable in the market directly, but can be determined from observable prices via model calibration procedures or estimated from historical data or other sources. Examples of inputs that may be unobservable include volatility surfaces, in whole or in part, for less commonly traded option products, and correlations between market factors such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Derivative products valued using valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs included certain types of correlation products, such as foreign exchange basket options, equity basket options, foreign exchange interest rate hybrid transactions and long-dated option transactions. Examples of the latter are equity options, interest rate and foreign exchange options and certain credit derivatives. Credit derivatives include certain tranched CDS transactions.

Purchases and sales of Level 3 available-for-sale assets predominantly reflect ABS activity, particularly in the securities investment conduits. Transfers out of Level 3 available-for-sale securities reflect increased confidence in the pricing of certain emerging markets corporate debt, in addition to improved price discovery of some ABSs. Transfers into Level 3 largely relate to other ABSs where price discovery has deteriorated. New issuances of trading liabilities reflect structured note issuances, mainly equity-linked notes. Transfers out of Level 3 trading liabilities principally relate to equity linked notes as certain model inputs became observable. Transfers into Level 3 trading assets primarily relate to loans in the process of syndication.

When the available data is not amenable to statistical analysis, the quantification of uncertainty is judgemental, but remains guided by the 95% confidence interval. When the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the above table reflects the most favourable or the most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually. Key unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments The table below lists key unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments, and provides the range of those inputs as at 31 December 2014. The core range of inputs is the estimated range within which 90% of the inputs fall. A further description of the categories of key unobservable inputs is given below.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 387 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Private equity including strategic investments HSBCs private equity and strategic investments are generally classified as available for sale and are not traded in active markets. In the absence of an active market, an investments fair value is estimated on the basis of an analysis of the investees financial position and results, risk profile, prospects and other factors, as well as by reference to market valuations for similar entities quoted in an active market, or the price at which similar companies have changed ownership. Given the bespoke nature of the analysis in respect of each holding, it is not practical to quote a range of key unobservable inputs. Prepayment rates Prepayment rates are a measure of the anticipated future speed at which a loan portfolio will be repaid in advance of the due date. Prepayment rates are an important input into modelled values of ABSs. A modelled price may be used where insufficient observable market prices exist to enable a market price to be determined directly. Prepayment rates are also an important input into the valuation of derivatives linked to securitisations. For example, so-called securitisation swaps have a notional value that is linked to the size of the outstanding loan portfolio in a securitisation, which may fall as prepayments occur. Prepayment rates vary according to the nature of the loan portfolio, and expectations of future market conditions. For example, current prepayment rates in US residential MBSs would generally be expected to rise as the US economy improves. Prepayment rates may be estimated using a variety of evidence, such as prepayment rates implied from proxy observable security prices, current or historical prepayment rates and macro-economic modelling. Market proxy Market proxy pricing may be used for an instrument for which specific market pricing is not available, but evidence is available in respect of instruments that have some characteristics in common. In some cases it might be possible to identify a specific proxy, but more generally evidence across a wider range of instruments will be used to understand the factors that influence current market pricing and the manner of that influence. For example, in the collateralised loan obligation market it may be possible to establish that A-rated securities exhibit prices in a range, and to isolate key factors that influence position within the range. Applying this to a specific A-rated security within HSBCs portfolio allows assignment of a price. The range of prices used as inputs into a market proxy pricing methodology may therefore be wide. This range is not indicative of the uncertainty associated with the price derived for an individual security. Volatility Volatility is a measure of the anticipated future variability of a market price. Volatility tends to increase in stressed market conditions, and decrease in calmer market conditions. Volatility is an important input in the pricing of options. In general, the higher the volatility, the more expensive the option will be. This reflects both the higher probability of an increased return from the option and the potentially higher costs that HSBC may incur in hedging the risks associated with the option. If option prices become more expensive, this will increase the value of HSBCs long option positions (i.e. the positions in which HSBC has purchased options), while HSBCs short option positions (i.e. the positions in which HSBC has sold options) will suffer losses. Volatility varies by underlying reference market price, and by strike and maturity of the option. Volatility also varies over time. As a result, it is difficult to make general statements regarding volatility levels. For example, while it is generally the case that foreign exchange volatilities are lower than equity volatilities, there may be examples in particular currency pairs or for particular equities where this is not the case. Certain volatilities, typically those of a longer-dated nature, are unobservable. The unobservable volatility is then estimated from observable data. For example, longer-dated volatilities may be extrapolated from shorter-dated volatilities. The range of unobservable volatilities quoted in the table on page 387 reflects the wide variation in volatility inputs by reference market price. For example, foreign exchange volatilities for a pegged currency may be very low, whereas for non-managed currencies the foreign exchange volatility may be higher. As a further example, volatilities for deep-in-the-money or deep-out-of-the-money equity options may be significantly higher than at-the-money options. The core range is significantly narrower than the full range because these examples with extreme volatilities occur relatively rarely within the HSBC portfolio. For any single unobservable volatility, the uncertainty in the volatility determination is significantly less than the range quoted above. Correlation Correlation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two market prices and is expressed as a number between minus one and one. A positive correlation implies that the two market prices tend to move in the same direction, with a correlation of one implying that they always move in the same direction. A negative correlation implies that the two market prices tend to move in opposite directions, with a correlation of minus one implying that the two market prices always move in opposite directions. Correlation is used to value more complex instruments where the payout is dependent upon more than one market price. For example, an equity basket option has a payout that is dependent upon the performance of a basket of single stocks, and the correlation between the price movements of those stocks will be an HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 388 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) input to the valuation. This is referred to as equity-equity correlation. There is a wide range of instruments for which correlation is an input, and consequently a wide range of both same-asset correlations (e.g. equity-equity correlation) and cross-asset correlations (e.g. foreign exchange rate-interest rate correlation) used. In general, the range of same-asset correlations will be narrower than the range of cross-asset correlations. Correlation may be unobservable. Unobservable correlations may be estimated based upon a range of evidence, including consensus pricing services, HSBC trade prices, proxy correlations and examination of historical price relationships. The range of unobservable correlations quoted in the table reflects the wide variation in correlation inputs by market price pair. For any single unobservable correlation, the uncertainty in the correlation determination is likely to be less than the range quoted above. Credit spread Credit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality. In a discounted cash flow model, the credit spread increases the discount factors applied to future cash flows, thereby reducing the value of an asset. Credit spreads may be implied from market prices. Credit spreads may not be observable in more illiquid markets. Inter-relationships between key unobservable inputs Key unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments may not be independent of each other. As described above, market variables may be correlated. This correlation typically reflects the manner in which different markets tend to react to macroeconomic or other events. For example, improving economic conditions may lead to a risk on market, in which prices of risky assets such as equities and high yield bonds rise, while safe haven assets such as gold and US Treasuries decline. Furthermore, the effect of changing market variables upon the HSBC portfolio will depend on HSBCs net risk position in respect of each variable. For example, increasing high-yield bond prices will benefit long high-yield bond positions, but the value of any credit derivative protection held against these bonds will fall.

Previously, non-trading reverse repos were included within Loans and advances to banks and Loans and advances to customers and non-trading repos were included within Deposits by banks and Customer accounts. Comparative data have been re-presented accordingly. Non-trading reverse repos and repos have been presented as separate lines in the balance sheet to align disclosure with market practice and provide more meaningful information in relation to loans and advances. Fair values are determined according to the hierarchy set out in Note 13. Other financial instruments not carried at fair value are typically short-term in nature and reprice to current market rates frequently. Accordingly, their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. This includes cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection/transmission from/to other banks, Hong Kong Government certificates of indebtedness and Hong Kong currency notes in circulation, all of which are measured at amortised cost.

It does not reflect the economic benefits and costs that HSBC expects to flow from the instruments cash flows over their expected future lives. Other reporting entities may use different valuation methodologies and assumptions in determining fair values for which no observable market prices are available. Fair values of the following assets and liabilities are estimated for the purpose of disclosure as described below: Loans and advances to banks and customers The fair value of loans and advances is based on observable market transactions, where available. In the absence of observable market transactions, fair value is estimated using valuation models that incorporate a range of input assumptions. These assumptions may include value estimates from third-party brokers which reflect over-the-counter trading activity, forward looking discounted cash flow models using assumptions which HSBC believes are consistent with those which would be used by market participants in valuing such loans, and trading inputs from other market participants which include observed primary and secondary trades. Loans are grouped, as far as possible, into homogeneous groups and stratified by loans with similar characteristics to improve the accuracy of estimated valuation outputs. The stratification of a loan book considers all material factors including vintage, origination period, estimates of future interest rates, prepayment speeds, delinquency rates, loan-to-value ratios, the quality of collateral, default probability, and internal credit risk ratings. The fair value of a loan reflects both loan impairments at the balance sheet date and estimates of market participants expectations of credit losses over the life of the loans, and the fair value effect of repricing between origination and the balance sheet date. The fair value of loans and advances to customers in North America is lower than the carrying amount, primarily in the US, reflecting the market conditions at the balance sheet date. This is due to the challenging economic conditions during the past number of years, including house price depreciation, rising unemployment, changes in consumer behaviour, changes in discount rates and the lack of financing options available to support the purchase of loans and advances. The relative fair values have increased during 2014 largely due to improved conditions in the housing industry driven by increased property values and, to a lesser extent, lower required market yields and increased investor demand for these types of loans and advances. The fair value of loans and advances to customers in Europe has improved relative to the carrying amount, primarily in the UK mortgage market where increased competition and central bank policies to stimulate lending have reduced interest rates and increased fair values accordingly. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 391 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Financial investments The fair values of listed financial investments are determined using bid market prices. The fair values of unlisted financial investments are determined using valuation techniques that take into consideration the prices and future earnings streams of equivalent quoted securities. Deposits by banks and customer accounts Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of a deposit repayable on demand is approximated by its carrying value. Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities Fair values are determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date where available, or by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements  non-trading Fair values are estimated by using discounted cash flows, applying current rates. Fair values approximate carrying amounts as their balances are generally short dated.

HSBC may designate financial instruments at fair value when the designation:  eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise from measuring financial instruments, or recognising gains and losses on different bases from related positions. Under this criterion, the main class of financial assets designated by HSBC are financial assets under unit-linked insurance and unit-linked investment contracts. Liabilities to customers under linked contracts are determined based on the fair value of the assets held in the linked funds. If no fair value designation was made for the related assets, the assets would be classified as available for sale, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. The related financial assets and liabilities are managed and reported to management on a fair value basis. Designation at fair value of the financial assets and related liabilities allows the changes in fair values to be recorded in the income statement and presented in the same line;  applies to groups of financial instruments that are managed, and their performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and where information about the groups of financial instruments is reported to management on that basis. For example, certain financial assets are held to meet liabilities under non-linked insurance contracts. HSBC has documented risk management and investment strategies designed to manage and monitor market risk of those assets on net basis, after considering non-linked liabilities. Fair value measurement is also consistent with the regulatory reporting requirements under the appropriate regulations for those insurance operations;  relates to financial instruments containing one or more non-closely related embedded derivatives. Designated financial assets are recognised at fair value when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on trade date, and are normally derecognised when sold. Subsequent changes in fair values are recognised in the income statement in Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 393 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 16 Derivatives Accounting policy Derivatives Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, bonds, interest rates, foreign exchange, credit spreads, commodities and equity or other indices. Derivatives are recognised initially, and are subsequently measured, at fair value. Fair values of derivatives are obtained either from quoted market prices or by using valuation techniques. Embedded derivatives are bifurcated from the host contract when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host non-derivative contract, their contractual terms would otherwise meet the definition of a stand-alone derivative and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value. The bifurcated embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes therein recognised in the income statement. Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive, or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are only offset for accounting purposes if the offsetting criteria presented in Note 32 are met. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives, including the contractual interest, that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in Net trading income. Gains and losses for derivatives managed in conjunction with financial instruments designated at fair value are reported in Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value together with the gains and losses on the economically hedged items. Where the derivatives are managed with debt securities issued by HSBC that are designated at fair value, the contractual interest is shown in Interest expense together with the interest payable on the issued debt. Hedge accounting When derivatives are designated as hedges, HSBC classifies them as either: (i) hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedges); (ii) hedges of the variability in highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecast transaction (cash flow hedges); or (iii) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges). At the inception of a hedging relationship, HSBC documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, its risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking the hedge. HSBC requires a documented assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether or not the hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes attributable to the hedged risks in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the income statement, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or group that contain the hedged risk. If a hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge accounting is discontinued; the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement on a recalculated effective interest rate over the residual period to maturity, unless the hedged item has been derecognised, in which case it is recognised in the income statement immediately. Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income; the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. The accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. In hedges of forecasted transactions that result in recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, previous gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income remains in equity until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the income statement. Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. A gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income; the residual change in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement on the disposal, or part disposal, of the foreign operation. Hedge effectiveness testing To qualify for hedge accounting, HSBC requires that at the inception of the hedge and throughout its life each hedge must be expected to be highly effective, both prospectively and retrospectively, on an ongoing basis. The documentation of each hedging relationship sets out how the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed and the method adopted by an entity to assess hedge effectiveness will depend on its risk management strategy. For prospective effectiveness, the hedging instrument must be expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated, with the effectiveness range being defined as 80% to 125%. Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement in Net trading income. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Non-qualifying hedges are derivatives entered into as economic hedges of assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting was not applied.

HSBCs derivative activities give rise to significant open positions in portfolios of derivatives. These positions are managed constantly to ensure that they remain within acceptable risk levels. When entering into derivative transactions, HSBC employs the same credit risk management framework to assess and approve potential credit exposures that it uses for traditional lending. Trading derivatives Most of HSBCs derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities include market-making and risk management. Market-making entails quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants for the purpose of generating revenues based on spread and volume. Risk management activity is undertaken to manage the risk arising from client transactions, with the principal purpose of retaining client margin. Other derivatives classified as held for trading include non-qualifying hedging derivatives, ineffective hedging derivatives and the components of hedging derivatives that are excluded from assessing hedge effectiveness. Substantially all of HSBC Holdings derivatives entered into with HSBC undertakings are managed in conjunction with financial liabilities designated at fair value.

Credit derivatives HSBC trades credit derivatives through its principal dealing operations and acts as a principal counterparty to a broad range of users, structuring transactions to produce risk management products for its customers, or making markets in certain products. Risk is typically controlled through entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts with other counterparties. HSBC manages the credit risk arising on buying and selling credit derivative protection by including the related credit exposures within its overall credit limit structure for the relevant counterparty. Trading of credit derivatives is restricted to a small number of offices within the major centres which have the control infrastructure and market skills to manage effectively the credit risk inherent in the products. Credit derivatives are also deployed to a limited extent for the risk management of the Groups loan portfolios. The notional contract amount of credit derivatives of US$550bn (2013: US$678bn) consisted of protection bought of US$272bn (2013: US$339bn) and protection sold of US$278bn (2013: US$339bn). The credit derivative business operates within the market risk management framework described on page 222. Derivatives valued using models with unobservable inputs The difference between the fair value at initial recognition (the transaction price) and the value that would have been derived had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition, less subsequent releases, is as follows: Unamortised balance of derivatives valued using models with significant unobservable inputs 2014 2013 US$m US$m Unamortised balance at 1 January 167 181 Deferral on new transactions 177 206 Recognised in the income statement during the period: (234 ) (221 )  amortisation (114 ) (105 )  subsequent to unobservable inputs becoming observable (13 ) (39 )  maturity, termination or offsetting derivative (107 ) (77 )  risk hedged   Exchange differences 4 1 Unamortised balance at 31 December1 114 167 1 This amount is yet to be recognised in the consolidated income statement. Hedge accounting derivatives HSBC uses derivatives (principally interest rate swaps) for hedging purposes in the management of its own asset and liability portfolios and structural positions. This enables HSBC to optimise the overall cost to the Group of accessing debt capital markets, and to mitigate the market risk which would otherwise arise from structural imbalances in the maturity and other profiles of its assets and liabilities. The notional contract amounts of derivatives held for hedge accounting purposes indicate the nominal value of transactions outstanding at the balance sheet date; they do not represent amounts at risk.

Cash flow hedges HSBCs cash flow hedges consist principally of interest rate swaps, futures and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against exposures to variability in future interest cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates or which are expected to be re-funded or reinvested in the future. The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults. The aggregate principal balances and interest cash flows across all portfolios over time form the basis for identifying gains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions.

During the year to 31 December 2014 a gain of US$34m (2013: gain of US$22m; 2012: gain of US$35m) was recognised due to hedge ineffectiveness. Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of certain consolidated net investments. Hedging is undertaken using forward foreign exchange contracts or by financing with currency borrowings. At 31 December 2014, the fair values of outstanding financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations were assets of US$55m (2013: US$4m), liabilities of US$1m (2013: US$23m) and notional contract values of US$3,525m (2013: US$2,840m). Ineffectiveness recognised in Net trading income in the year ended 31 December 2014 was nil (2013 and 2012: nil). 17 Non-trading reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements Accounting policy When securities are sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them at a predetermined price (repos), they remain on the balance sheet and a liability is recorded in respect of the consideration received. Securities purchased under commitments to resell (reverse repos) are not recognised on the balance sheet and an asset is recorded in respect of the initial consideration paid. Non trading repos and reverse repos are measured at amortised cost. The difference between the sale and repurchase price or between the purchase and resale price is treated as interest and recognised in net interest income over the life of the agreement. Non-trading repos and reverse repos are presented as separate lines in the balance sheet. This separate presentation was adopted with effect from 1 January 2014 and comparatives are re-presented accordingly. Previously, non-trading reverse repos were included within Loans and advances to banks and Loans and advances to customers and non-trading repos were included within Deposits by banks and Customer accounts. The extent to which non-trading reverse repos and repos represent amounts with customers and banks is set out below. 2014 2013 US$m US$m Assets Banks 95,403 91,475 Customers 66,310 88,215 At 31 December 161,713 179,690 Liabilities Banks 27,876 42,705 Customers 79,556 121,515 At 31 December 107,432 164,220 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 398 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 18 Financial investments Accounting policy Treasury bills, debt securities and equity securities intended to be held on a continuing basis, other than those designated at fair value, are classified as available for sale or held to maturity. They are recognised on trade date when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements to purchase those instruments, and are normally derecognised when either the securities are sold or redeemed. (i) Available-for-sale financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus direct and incremental transaction costs. They are subsequently remeasured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in other comprehensive income until they are either sold or become impaired. When available-for-sale financial assets are sold, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement as Gains less losses from financial investments. Interest income is recognised over a debt securitys expected life. Premiums and/or discounts arising on the purchase of dated debt securities are included in the interest recognised. Dividends from equity assets are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established. (ii) Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that HSBC positively intends and is able to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are initially recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any impairment losses. The accounting policy relating to impairments of available-for-sale securities is presented in Note 1(k). Available-for-sale financial assets are reclassified to held to maturity if there is a change in intention or ability to hold those assets to maturity due to a change in the way those assets are managed. The fair value on reclassification becomes the new amortised cost and the assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost rather than fair value.

This is the case for securitisations and covered bonds where the amount of liabilities issued, plus any mandatory over-collateralisation, is less than the book value of financial assets available for funding or collateral purposes in the relevant pool of assets. This is also the case where financial assets are placed with a custodian or settlement agent which has a floating charge over all the financial assets placed to secure any liabilities under settlement accounts. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 401 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where relevant, standard securities lending and repurchase agreements. Assets transferred Accounting policy Derecognition of financial assets Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the assets has expired; or when HSBC has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows of the financial assets, and either:  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred; or  HSBC has neither retained nor transferred substantially all the risks and rewards, but has not retained control. HSBC enters into transactions in the normal course of business by which it transfers financial assets to third parties. Depending on the circumstances, these transfers may either result in these financial assets being derecognised or continuing to be recognised. The financial assets shown above include amounts transferred to third parties that do not qualify for derecognition, notably debt securities held by counterparties as collateral under repurchase agreements and equity securities lent under securities lending agreements. As the substance of these transactions is secured borrowings, the asset collateral continues to be recognised in full and the related liability reflecting the Groups obligation to repurchase the transferred assets for a fixed price at a future date is recognised on the balance sheet. As a result of these transactions, the Group is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 402 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 20 Interests in associates and joint ventures Accounting policy Investments in which HSBC, together with one or more parties, has joint control of an arrangement set up to undertake an economic activity are classified as joint ventures. HSBC classifies investments in entities over which it has significant influence, and that are neither subsidiaries (Note 22) nor joint ventures, as associates. Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method. Under this method, such investments are initially stated at cost, including attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in HSBCs share of net assets. Goodwill arises on the acquisition of interests in joint ventures and associates when the cost of investment exceeds HSBCs share of the net fair value of the associates or joint ventures identifiable assets and liabilities. An investment in an associate is tested for impairment when there is an indication that the investment may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in joint ventures and associates is not tested separately for impairment. Profits on transactions between HSBC and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of HSBCs interest in the respective associates or joint ventures. Losses are also eliminated to the extent of HSBCs interest in the associates or joint ventures unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Impairment of interests in associates Impairment testing involves significant judgement in determining the value in use, and in particular estimating the present values of cash flows expected to arise from continuing to hold the investment. The most significant judgements relate to the impairment testing of our investment in Bank of Communications (BoCom). Key assumptions used in estimating BoComs value in use, the sensitivity of the value in use calculation to different assumptions and a sensitivity analysis that shows the changes in key assumptions that would reduce the excess of value in use over the carrying amount (the headroom) to nil are described in the Note below.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 403 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Bank of Communications Co., Limited (BoCom) HSBCs investment in BoCom was equity accounted with effect from August 2004. HSBCs significant influence in BoCom was established as a result of representation on the Board of Directors and, in accordance with the Technical Cooperation and Exchange Programme, HSBC is assisting in the maintenance of financial and operating policies and a number of staff has been seconded to assist in this process. Impairment testing At 31 December 2014, the fair value of HSBCs investment in BoCom had been below the carrying amount for approximately 32 months, apart from a short period in 2013. As a result, we performed an impairment test on the carrying amount of the investment in BoCom. The test confirmed that there was no impairment at 31 December 2014. The recoverable amount was US$15.7bn (2013: US$14.0bn), an excess over carrying amount (headroom) of US$1.1bn at 31 December 2014 (2013: US$0.6bn). The increase in headroom is due to the improved capital position of BoCom.

The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on managements estimates of earnings. Cash flows beyond the short- to medium-term are then extrapolated in perpetuity using a long-term growth rate. An imputed capital maintenance charge (CMC) is included to meet the expected regulatory capital requirements, and calculated as a deduction from forecast cash flows. The principal inputs to the CMC calculation include estimates of asset growth, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets, and the expected regulatory capital requirements. Management judgement is required in estimating the future cash flows of BoCom. Key assumptions in VIU calculation Long-term growth rate: the growth rate used was 5% (2013: 5%) for periods after 2018 and does not exceed forecast GDP growth in China. Discount rate: the discount rate of 13% (2013: 13%) is derived from a range of values obtained by applying a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) calculation for BoCom, using market data. Management supplements this by comparing the rates derived from the CAPM with discount rates available from external sources, and HSBCs discount rate for evaluating investments in China. The discount rate used was within the range of 11.4% to 14.2% (2013: 10.5% to 15.0%) indicated by the CAPM and external sources. Loan impairment charge as a percentage of customer advances: the ratio used ranges from 0.73% to 1% (2013: 0.64% to 1%) in the short- to medium-term. The long-term ratio was assumed to revert to a historical rate of 0.65% (2013: 0.64%). The rates were within the short- to medium-term range forecasts of 0.51% to 1.08% (2013: 0.55% to 1.20%) disclosed by external analysts. Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets: the ratio used ranges from 70% to 72% in the short- to medium-term. The long-term ratio reverts to a rate of 70% (2013: 68.7%). Cost-income ratio: the ratio used ranges from 40.0% to 42.4% (2013: 39.7% to 43.2%) in the short- to medium-term. The ratios were within the short- to medium-term range forecasts of 37.2% to 44.5% (2013: 38.0% to 44.2%) disclosed by external analysts. Sensitivity analyses were performed on each key assumption to ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes in assumptions. The following change to each key assumption used on its own in the VIU calculation would reduce the headroom to nil. Key assumption Changes to key assumption to reduce headroom to nil  Long-term growth rate  Discount rate  Loan impairment charge as a percentage of customer advances  Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets  Cost-income ratio  Decrease by 43 basis points  Increase by 53 basis points  Increase by 8 basis points  Increase by 3.3%  Increase by 1.6% The following table illustrates the effect on VIU of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions. This reflects the sensitivity of VIU to each key assumption on its own and it is possible that more than one favourable and/or unfavourable change will occur at the same time.

If the amount of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is greater, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. HSBCs CGUs are based on geographical regions subdivided by global business. Impairment testing is performed at least annually, or whenever there is an indication of impairment, by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount. The carrying amount of a CGU is based on its assets and liabilities, including attributable goodwill. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. VIU is the present value of the expected future CGU cash flows. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is charged to the income statement. Goodwill is carried on balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses. At the date of disposal of a business, attributable goodwill is included in HSBCs share of net assets in the calculation of the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill is included in a disposal group if the disposal group is a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated or it is an operation within such a CGU. The amount of goodwill included in a disposal group is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Goodwill impairment The review of goodwill for impairment reflects managements best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as follows:  the future cash flows of the CGUs are sensitive to the cash flows projected for the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding the long-term pattern of sustainable cash flows thereafter. Forecasts are compared with actual performance and verifiable economic data, but they reflect managements view of future business prospects at the time of the assessment; and  the rates used to discount future expected cash flows can have a significant effect on their valuation and are based on the costs of capital assigned to individual CGUs. The cost of capital percentage is generally derived from a Capital Asset Pricing Model, which incorporates inputs reflecting a number of financial and economic variables, including the risk-free interest rate in the country concerned and a premium for the risk of the business being evaluated. These variables are subject to fluctuations in external market rates and economic conditions beyond managements control, are subject to uncertainty and require the exercise of significant judgement. A decline in a CGUs expected cash flows and/or an increase in its cost of capital reduces the CGUs estimated recoverable amount. If this is lower than the carrying value of the CGU, a charge for impairment of goodwill is recognised in our income statement for the year. The accuracy of forecast cash flows is subject to a high degree of uncertainty in volatile market conditions. In such market conditions, management retests goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually to ensure that the assumptions on which the cash flow forecasts are based continue to reflect current market conditions and managements best estimate of future business prospects. During 2014, no impairment of goodwill was identified (2013: nil). In addition to the annual impairment test which was performed as at 1 July 2014, management reviewed the current and expected performance of the CGUs as at 31 December 2014 and determined that there was no indication of impairment of the goodwill allocated to them.

On transfer to held for sale, a write down of the disposal group by US$279m was recorded and allocated to goodwill. Following the later decision to retain the operations, the reclassification of the assets and liabilities out of held for sale resulted in the reinstatement of the remaining goodwill. Impairment testing Timing of impairment testing HSBCs impairment test in respect of goodwill allocated to each CGU is performed as at 1 July each year. Basis of the recoverable amount The recoverable amount of all CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated was equal to its VIU at each respective testing date for 2013 and 2014. For each significant CGU, the VIU is calculated by discounting managements cash flow projections for the CGU. The discount rate used is based on the cost of capital HSBC allocates to investments in the countries within which the CGU operates. The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective within the Group of the business units making up the CGUs. For the goodwill impairment test conducted at 1 July 2014, managements cash flow projections until the end of 2018 were used.

The Groups CGUs do not carry on their balance sheets any significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, other than goodwill. Nominal long-term growth rate: this growth rate reflects GDP and inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates. The rates are based on IMF forecast growth rates as these rates are regarded as the most relevant estimate of likely future trends. The rates used for 2013 and 2014 do not exceed the long-term growth rate for the countries within which the CGU operates. Discount rate: the discount rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of capital assigned to each CGU, which is derived using a CAPM. The CAPM depends on inputs reflecting a number of financial and economic variables including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated. These variables are based on the markets assessment of the economic variables and managements judgement. For the 1 July 2014 test, the methodology used to determine the discount rate for each CGU was refined to more accurately reflect the rates of inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates. In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, management supplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM with cost of capital rates produced by external sources. HSBC uses externally-sourced cost of capital rates where, in managements judgement, those rates reflect more accurately the current market and economic conditions. For 2013 and 2014, internal costs of capital rates were consistent with externally-sourced rates. Managements judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU: the cash flow projections for each CGU are based on plans approved by the GMB. The key assumptions in addition to the discount rate and nominal long-term growth rate for each significant CGU are discussed below. Global Private Banking  Europe: the cash flow forecast for GPB  Europe primarily reflects the repositioning of the business that is underway to concentrate on clients aligned with the Groups priorities. Revenues in GPB  Europe are predominately generated through HSBCs client relationships and the key assumption in the cash flow forecast is the level of assets under management and profitability therein following the strategic repositioning. The cash flow forecast includes increased profitability in GPB  Europe which is dependent on management achieving the planned strategic repositioning, in the context of the external environment. At 1 July 2014, GPB  Europe had an excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount (headroom) of US$1.8bn. The following changes to the key assumptions in the value in use calculation would be necessary in order to reduce headroom to nil: Key assumption Discount rate Long-term growth rate Cash flow projection Change to key assumption to reduce headroom to nil Increase by 90 basis points Decrease by 102 basis points Decrease by 19.7% The following table illustrates the effect on VIU of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions. This reflects the sensitivity of VIU to each key assumption on its own and it is possible that more than one favourable and/or unfavourable change will occur at the same time.

Key assumptions include the level of interest rates, nominal GDP growth, competitors positions within the market and the level and change in unemployment rates. While current economic conditions in Europe continue to be challenging, managements cash flow projections are based primarily on these prevailing conditions. Risks include slower than expected growth and an uncertain regulatory environment. RBWM  Europe is sensitive to further customer remediation and regulatory actions. Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions described above would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of RBWM  Europe or CMB  Europe. Global Banking and Markets  Europe: the key assumption included in the cash flow projection for GB&M  Europe is that European markets will continue to recover. Accordingly, recovery in European revenues is assumed to continue over the projection period to 2018. Interest rate fluctuations would put further pressure on European markets revenue recovery. Our ability to achieve the forecast cash flows for GB&M  Europe could be adversely impacted by regulatory change during the forecast period including but not limited to the extent that the recommendations set out in the final report by the Independent Commission on Banking are implemented. Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions described above would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of GB&M  Europe. Retail Banking and Wealth Management  Latin America: the assumptions included in the cash flow projections for RBWM  Latin America reflect the economic environment and financial outlook of the countries within this CGU, with Brazil and Mexico being the two largest. Key assumptions include growth in lending and deposit volumes and the credit quality of the loan portfolios. Potential challenges include unfavourable economic conditions restricting client demand and competitor pricing constraining margins. Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions described above would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of RBWM  Latin America. Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets are recognised, and those that are acquired in a business combination are distinguished from goodwill, when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets include the present value of in-force long-term insurance business and long-term investment contracts with discretionary participating features (PVIF), computer software, trade names, mortgage servicing rights, customer lists, core deposit relationships, credit card customer relationships and merchant or other loan relationships. Computer software includes both purchased and internally generated software. The cost of internally generated software comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the software to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immediately as incurred. Intangible assets are subject to impairment review if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where:  intangible assets have an indefinite useful life, or are not yet ready for use, they are tested for impairment annually. An intangible asset recognised during the current period is tested before the end of the current year; and where  intangible assets have a finite useful life, except for PVIF, they are stated at cost less amortisation and accumulated impairment losses and are amortised over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful life is the lower of legal duration and expected useful life. The amortisation of mortgage servicing rights is included within Net fee income. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 410 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised, generally on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives as follows: Trade names 10 years Mortgage servicing rights generally between 5 and 12 years Internally generated software between 3 and 5 years Purchased software between 3 and 5 years Customer/merchant relationships generally between 3 and 10 years Other generally 10 years Present value of in-force long-term insurance business The value placed on insurance contracts that are classified as long-term insurance business or long-term investment contracts with discretionary participating features (DPF) and are in force at the balance sheet date is recognised as an asset. The asset represents the present value of the equity holders interest in the issuing insurance companies profits expected to emerge from these contracts written at the balance sheet date. The PVIF is determined by discounting the equity holders interest in future profits expected to emerge from business currently in force using appropriate assumptions in assessing factors such as future mortality, lapse rates and levels of expenses, and a risk discount rate that reflects the risk premium attributable to the respective contracts. The PVIF incorporates allowances for both non-market risk and the value of financial options and guarantees. The PVIF asset is presented gross of attributable tax in the balance sheet and movements in the PVIF asset are included in Other operating income on a gross of tax basis. Present value of in-force long-term insurance business Our life insurance business is accounted for using the embedded value approach which, inter alia, provides a risk and valuation framework. The PVIF asset at 31 December 2014 was US$5.3bn (2013: US$5.3bn). Movements in PVIF 2014 2013 US$m US$m PVIF at 1 January 5,335 4,847 Value of new business written during the year1 870 924 Movements arising from in-force business:  expected return (545 ) (505 )  experience variances2 62 (20 )  changes in operating assumptions (69 ) 186 Investment return variances (34 ) 42 Changes in investment assumptions (75 ) (120 ) Other adjustments 52 18 Change in PVIF of long-term insurance business 261 525 Transfer of assets classified as held for sale3 (122 )  Exchange differences and other (167 ) (37 ) PVIF at 31 December 5,307 5,335 1 Value of new business written during the year is the present value of the projected stream of profits from the business. 2 Experience variances include the effect of the difference between demographic, expense and persistency assumptions used in the previous PVIF calculation and actual experience observed during the year to the extent this affects profits on future business. 3 Relates to the UK Pensions business which was classified as held for sale in the first half of the year. See page 191 for further details. In the PVIF calculation, expected cash flows are projected after adjusting for a variety of assumptions made by each insurance operation to reflect local market conditions and managements judgement of future trends, and after applying risk margins to reflect any uncertainty in the underlying assumptions. The main assumptions relate to economic and non-economic assumptions and policyholder behaviour. Variations in actual experience and changes to assumptions can contribute to volatility in the results of the insurance business. The key drivers of the movement in the value of the PVIF asset are the expected cash flows from:  new business adjusted for anticipated maturities and assumptions relating to policyholder behaviour (value of new business written during the year);  unwind of the discount rate less the reversal of expected cash flows for the period (expected return);  changes in non-economic operating assumptions such as mortality or lapse rates (change in operating assumptions);  the effects of changes in projected future cash flows associated with operating assumption experience variances compared with those assumed at the start of the period (experience variances);  changes related to future investment returns (changes in investment assumptions); and  the effect of actual investment experience on existing assets compared with the assumptions at the start of the period (investment return variances). The valuation of the PVIF asset includes explicit risk margins for non-economic risks in the projection assumptions and explicit allowances for financial options and guarantees using stochastic methods. Risk discount rates are set on an active basis with reference to market risk-free yields. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 411 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Key assumptions used in the computation of PVIF for main life insurance operations Economic assumptions are either set in a way that is consistent with observable market values or, in certain markets (including those where the risk free curve is not observable at tenors matching the duration of our insurance contract liabilities) we make use of long-term economic assumptions. Setting such assumptions involves the projection of long-term interest rates and the time horizon over which rates in less developed markets will tend towards the norms observed in mature markets. The assumptions are informed by relevant historical data and by research and analysis performed by the Groups Economic Research team and external experts. The valuation of PVIF will be sensitive to any changes in these long-term assumptions in the same way that it is sensitive to observed market movements, and the impact of such changes is included in the sensitivities presented below. 2014 2013 UK Hong Kong France1 UK Hong Kong France1 % % % % % % Weighted average risk free rate 1.65 1.86 1.21 2.45 2.31 2.38 Weighted average risk discount rate 2.15 7.42 1.73 2.95 7.41 4.69 Expense inflation 4.67 3.00 2.00 3.39 3.00 2.00 1 For 2014, the calculation of Frances PVIF assumes a risk discount rate of 1.73% plus a risk margin of US$ 63m. For 2013, a composite rate of 4.69% was used. This was equivalent to a rate of 3.08% plus a risk margin of US$64m. Sensitivity to changes in economic assumptions The Group sets the risk discount rate applied to the PVIF calculation by starting from a risk-free rate curve and adding explicit allowances for risks not reflected in the best estimate cash flow modelling. Where shareholders provide options and guarantees to policyholders the cost of these options and guarantees is an explicit reduction to PVIF, unless it is already allowed for as an explicit addition to the technical provisions required by regulators. See page 195 for further details of these guarantees. The following table shows the effect on the PVIF of reasonably possible changes in the main economic assumption, risk-free rates, across all insurance manufacturing subsidiaries. Due to certain characteristics of the contracts, the relationships are non-linear and the results of the sensitivity testing should not be extrapolated to higher levels of stress. The sensitivities shown are before actions that could be taken by management to mitigate effects and before resultant changes in policyholder behaviour. The sensitivities have increased from 2013 to 2014, driven mainly by falling yields and a flattening of the yield curve in France during 2014. In the low yield environment the PVIF asset is particularly sensitive to yield curve movements driven by the projected cost of options and guarantees described on page 195. 2014 2013 US$m US$m Effect on PVIF at 31 December of: + 100 basis point shift in risk-free rate 320 184  100 basis point shift in risk-free rate1 (589 ) (289 ) 1 Where a 100 basis point parallel shift in the risk-free rate would result in a negative rate, the effect on PVIF has been calculated using a minimum rate of 0%. Sensitivity to changes in non-economic assumptions Policyholder liabilities and PVIF for life manufacturers are determined by reference to non-economic assumptions including mortality and/or morbidity, lapse rates and expense rates. The table below shows the sensitivity of PVIF to reasonably possible changes in these non-economic assumptions at that date across all our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries. 2014 2013 US$m US$m Effect on PVIF at 31 December of: 10% increase in mortality and/or morbidity rates (66 ) (84 ) 10% decrease in mortality and/or morbidity rates 70 84 10% increase in lapse rates (146 ) (154 ) 10% decrease in lapse rates 165 173 10% increase in expense rates (93 ) (109 ) 10% decrease in expense rates 94 110 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 412 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Other intangible assets Movement of intangible assets excluding goodwill and the PVIF Internally generated software Other Total US$m US$m US$m Cost At 1 January 2014 5,999 2,975 8,974 Additions 732 177 909 Disposals (35 ) (80 ) (115 ) Amount written off (24 ) (53 ) (77 ) Other changes (259 ) (156 ) (415 ) At 31 December 2014 6,413 2,863 9,276 Accumulated amortisation At 1 January 2014 (3,809 ) (1,761 ) (5,570 ) Charge for the year1 (677 ) (261 ) (938 ) Impairment (11 ) (54 ) (65 ) Disposals 32 77 109 Amount written off 24 53 77 Other changes 155 57 212 At 31 December 2014 (4,286 ) (1,889 ) (6,175 ) Net carrying amount at 31 December 2014 2,127 974 3,101 Cost At 1 January 2013 5,703 3,345 9,048 Additions 731 142 873 Disposals (117 ) (196 ) (313 ) Amount written off (57 ) (47 ) (104 ) Other changes (261 ) (269 ) (530 ) At 31 December 2013 5,999 2,975 8,974 Accumulated amortisation At 1 January 2013 (3,469 ) (1,963 ) (5,432 ) Charge for the year1 (675 ) (179 ) (854 ) Impairment (39 ) (4 ) (43 ) Disposals 111 167 278 Amount written off 57 47 104 Other changes 206 171 377 At 31 December 2013 (3,809 ) (1,761 ) (5,570 ) Net carrying amount at 31 December 2013 2,190 1,214 3,404 1 The amortisation charge for the year is recognised within the income statement under Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, with the exception of the amortisation of mortgage servicing rights which is recognised in Net fee income. The revaluation net of amortisation charge for mortgage servicing rights was US$67m in 2014 (2013: credit of US$34m). 22 Investments in subsidiaries Accounting policy HSBC classifies investments in entities which it controls as subsidiaries. HSBC consolidation policy is described in Note 1(h). Subsidiaries which are structured entities are covered in Note 39. HSBC Holdings investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are reversed through the income statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the investments recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.

All the above subsidiaries are included in the HSBC consolidated financial statements. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 414 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Details of all HSBC subsidiaries, as required under Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006, will be annexed to the next Annual Return of HSBC Holdings filed with the UK Registrar of Companies. The principal countries of operation are the same as the countries of incorporation except for HSBC Bank Middle East Limited, which operates mainly in the Middle East and North Africa, and HSBC Life (International) Limited, which operates mainly in Hong Kong. HSBC is structured as a network of regional banks and locally incorporated regulated banking entities. Each bank is separately capitalised in accordance with applicable prudential requirements and maintains a capital buffer consistent with the Groups risk appetite for the relevant country or region. Our capital management process culminates in the annual Group capital plan, which is approved by the Board. HSBC Holdings is the primary provider of equity capital to its subsidiaries and also provides them with non-equity capital where necessary. These investments are substantially funded by HSBC Holdings issuance of equity and non-equity capital and by profit retention. As part of its capital management process, HSBC Holdings seeks to maintain a balance between the composition of its capital and its investment in subsidiaries. Subject to the above, there is no current or foreseen impediment to HSBC Holdings ability to provide such investments. The ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, statutory reserves, and financial and operating performance. During 2014 and 2013, none of the Groups subsidiaries experienced significant restrictions on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged by our subsidiaries on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances. The amount of guarantees by HSBC Holdings in favour of other HSBC Group entities is set out in Note 37.

For further details, see Note 39. In each of the above cases, HSBC controls and consolidates an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Held-for-sale assets are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell, except for those assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. Immediately before the initial classification as held for sale, the carrying amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities are measured in accordance with applicable IFRSs. On subsequent remeasurement of a disposal group, the carrying amounts of any assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS 5, but are included in a disposal group classified as held for sale, are remeasured under applicable IFRSs before the fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group is determined. Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings are stated at historical cost, or fair value at the date of transition to IFRSs (deemed cost), less impairment losses and depreciation over their estimated useful lives, as follows:  freehold land is not depreciated;  freehold buildings are depreciated at the greater of 2% per annum on a straight-line basis or over their remaining useful lives; and  leasehold land and buildings are depreciated over the shorter of their unexpired terms of the leases or their remaining useful lives. Equipment, fixtures and fittings (including equipment on operating leases where HSBC is the lessor) are stated at cost less impairment losses and depreciation over their useful lives, which are generally between 5 years and 20 years. Property, plant and equipment is subject to an impairment review if their carrying amount may not be recoverable. HSBC holds certain properties as investments to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, and those investment properties are included on balance sheet at fair value.

Investment properties in Hong Kong, the Macau Special Administrative Region and mainland China, which represent more than 74% by value of HSBCs investment properties subject to revaluation, were valued by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited whose valuers are members of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors. Properties in other countries, which represent 26% by value of HSBCs investment properties, were valued by different independent professionally qualified valuers. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 416 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) 24 Trading liabilities Accounting policy Trading liabilities are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking. They are recognised on trade date, when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties, and are normally derecognised when extinguished. They are initially measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value and interest paid recognised in the income statement in Net trading income. The sale of borrowed securities is classified as trading liabilities. Trading liabilities 2014 US$m 2013 US$m Deposits by banks1 41,453 43,130 Customer accounts1 50,600 57,688 Other debt securities in issue (Note 26) 33,602 32,155 Other liabilities  net short positions in securities 64,917 74,052 At 31 December 190,572 207,025 1 Deposits by banks and customer accounts include repos, settlement accounts, stock lending and other amounts. At 31 December 2014, the cumulative amount of change in fair value attributable to changes in HSBCs credit risk was a loss of US$79m (2013: loss of US$95m). 25 Financial liabilities designated at fair value Accounting policy The criteria for designating instruments at fair value and their measurement are described in Note 15. The fair value designation, once made, is irrevocable. Designated financial liabilities are recognised when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties and are normally derecognised when extinguished. This section provides examples of such designations:  Long-term debt issues. The interest payable on certain fixed rate long-term debt securities issued has been matched with the interest on certain interest rate swaps as part of a documented interest rate risk management strategy. An accounting mismatch would arise if the debt securities issued were accounted for at amortised cost, and this mismatch is eliminated through the fair value designation.  Financial liabilities under unit-linked and non-linked investment contracts. HSBC issues contracts to customers that contain insurance risk, financial risk or a combination thereof. A contract under which HSBC accepts insignificant insurance risk from another party is not classified as an insurance contract, but is accounted for as a financial liability. See Note 28 for contracts where HSBC accepts significant insurance risk. Customer liabilities under linked and certain non-linked investment contracts issued by insurance subsidiaries and the corresponding financial assets are designated at fair value. Liabilities are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value which is calculated by reference to the value of the relevant underlying funds or indices. Premiums receivable and amounts withdrawn are accounted for as increases or decreases in the liability recorded in respect of investment contracts. The incremental costs directly related to the acquisition of new investment contracts or renewing existing investment contracts are deferred and amortised over the period during which the investment management services are provided.

The cumulative amount of the change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk was a loss of US$520m (2013: loss of US$859m). 26 Debt securities in issue Accounting policy Financial liabilities for debt securities issued are recognised when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties and initially measured at fair value, which is normally the consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred. Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities, other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss and financial guarantees, is at amortised cost, using the effective interest method to amortise the difference between proceeds received, net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred, and the redemption amount over the expected life of the instrument.

A contract under which HSBC accepts significant insurance risk from another party by agreeing to compensate that party on the occurrence of a specified uncertain future event, is classified as an insurance contract. An insurance contract may also transfer financial risk, but is accounted for as an insurance contract if the insurance risk is significant. Liabilities under insurance contracts Liabilities under non-linked life insurance contracts are calculated by each life insurance operation based on local actuarial principles. Liabilities under unit-linked life insurance contracts are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value which is calculated by reference to the value of the relevant underlying funds or indices. A liability adequacy test is carried out on insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of the liabilities is sufficient in the light of current estimates of future cash flows. When performing the liability adequacy test, all contractual cash flows are discounted and compared with the carrying value of the liability. When a shortfall is identified it is charged immediately to the income statement. Future profit participation on insurance contracts with DPF Where contracts provide discretionary profit participation benefits to policyholders, liabilities for these contracts include provisions for the future discretionary benefits to policyholders. These provisions reflect actual performance of the investment portfolio to date and management expectation of the future performance of the assets backing the contracts, as well as other experience factors such as mortality, lapses and operational efficiency, where appropriate. This benefit may arise from the contractual terms, regulation, or past distribution policy. Investment contracts with DPF While investment contracts with DPF are financial instruments, they continue to be treated as insurance contracts as permitted by IFRS 4. The Group therefore recognises the premiums for those contracts as revenue and recognises as an expense the resulting increase in the carrying amount of the liability. In the case of net unrealised investment gains on these contracts, whose discretionary benefits principally reflect the actual performance of the investment portfolio, the corresponding increase in the liabilities is recognised in either the income statement or other comprehensive income, following the treatment of the unrealised gains on the relevant assets. In the case of net unrealised losses, a deferred participating asset is recognised only to the extent that its recoverability is highly probable. Movements in the liabilities arising from realised gains and losses on relevant assets are recognised in the income statement.

The increase in liabilities to policyholders represents the aggregate of all events giving rise to additional liabilities to policyholders in the year. The key factors contributing to the movement in liabilities to policyholders include death claims, surrenders, lapses, liabilities to policyholders created at the initial inception of the policies, the declaration of bonuses and other amounts attributable to policyholders. 29 Provisions Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present legal or constructive obligation, which has arisen as a result of past events and for which a reliable estimate can be made. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Provisions Judgement is involved in determining whether a present obligation exists and in estimating the probability, timing and amount of any outflows. Professional expert advice is taken on the assessment of litigation, property (including onerous contracts) and similar obligations. Provisions for legal proceedings and regulatory matters typically require a higher degree of judgement than other types of provisions. When matters are at an early stage, accounting judgements can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty associated with determining whether a present obligation exists, and estimating the probability and amount of any outflows that may arise. As matters progress, management and legal advisers evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised, revising previous judgements and estimates as appropriate. At more advanced stages, it is typically easier to make judgements and estimates around a better defined set of possible outcomes. However, the amount provisioned can remain very sensitive to the assumptions used. There could be a wide range of possible outcomes for any pending legal proceedings, investigations or inquiries. As a result, it is often not practicable to quantify a range of possible outcomes for individual matters. It is also not practicable to meaningfully quantify ranges of potential outcomes in aggregate for these types of provisions because of the diverse nature and circumstances of such matters and the wide range of uncertainties involved. Provisions for customer remediation also require significant levels of estimation and judgement. The amounts of provisions recognised depend on a number of different assumptions, for example, the volume of inbound complaints, the projected period of inbound complaint volumes, the decay rate of complaint volumes, the population identified as systemically mis-sold and the number of policies per customer complaint.

Legal proceedings include civil court, arbitration or tribunal proceedings brought against HSBC companies (whether by way of claim or counterclaim) or civil disputes that may, if not settled, result in court, arbitration or tribunal proceedings. Regulatory matters refer to investigations, reviews and other actions carried out by, or in response to the actions of, regulators or law enforcement agencies in connection with alleged wrongdoing by HSBC. Customer remediation refers to activities carried out by HSBC to compensate customers for losses or damages associated with a failure to comply with regulations or to treat customers fairly. Customer remediation is initiated by HSBC in response to customer complaints and/or industry developments in sales practices, and is not necessarily initiated by regulatory action. Payment protection insurance At 31 December 2014, a provision of US$1,079m (31 December 2013: US$946m) was held relating to the estimated liability for redress in respect of the possible mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) policies in previous years. An increase in provisions of US$960m was recognised during the year, primarily reflecting an increase in inbound complaints by claims management companies compared to previous forecasts. The current projected trend of inbound complaint volumes implies that the redress programme will be complete by the first quarter of 2018. However, this timing is subject to uncertainty as the trend may change over time based on actual experience. Cumulative provisions made since the Judicial Review ruling in the first half of 2011 amounted to US$4.2bn of which US$3.2bn had been paid as at 31 December 2014. The estimated liability for redress is calculated on the basis of total premiums paid by the customer plus simple interest of 8% per annum (or the rate inherent in the related loan product where higher). The basis for calculating the redress liability is the same for single premium and regular premium policies. Future estimated redress levels are based on historically observed redress per policy. A total of approximately 5.4m PPI policies have been sold by HSBC since 2000, generating estimated revenues of US$4.3bn at 2014 average exchange rates. The gross written premiums on these polices was approximately US$5.6bn at 2014 average exchange rates. At 31 December 2014, the estimated total complaints expected to be received was 1.9m, representing 36% of total policies sold. It is estimated that contact will be made with regard to 2.3m policies, representing 42% of total policies sold. This estimate includes inbound complaints as well as HSBCs proactive contact exercise on certain policies (outbound contact). The following table details the cumulative number of complaints received at 31 December 2014 and the number of claims expected in the future: HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 421 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Cumulative to31 December2014 Future expected Inbound complaints1 (000s of policies) 1,215 344 Outbound contact (000s of policies) 448 291 Response rate to outbound contact 51% 51% Average uphold rate per claim2 77% 71% Average redress per claim (US$) 2,611 3,115 1 Excludes invalid claims where the complainant has not held a PPI policy. 2 Claims include inbound and responses to outbound contact. The main assumptions involved in calculating the redress liability are the volume of inbound complaints, the projected period of inbound complaints, the decay rate of complaint volumes, the population identified as systemically mis-sold and the number of policies per customer complaint. The main assumptions are likely to evolve over time as root cause analysis continues, more experience is available regarding customer initiated complaint volumes received, and we handle responses to our ongoing outbound contact. A 100,000 increase/decrease in the total inbound complaints would increase/decrease the redress provision by approximately US$222m at 2014 average exchange rates. Each 1% increase/decrease in the response rate to our outbound contact exercise would increase/decrease the redress provision by approximately US$13m. In addition to these factors and assumptions, the extent of the required redress will also depend on the facts and circumstances of each individual customers case. For these reasons, there is currently a high degree of uncertainty as to the eventual costs of redress. Interest rate derivatives At 31 December 2014, a provision of US$312m (31 December 2013: US$776m) was held relating to the estimated liability for redress in respect of the possible mis-selling of interest rate derivatives in the UK. The provision relates to the estimated redress payable to customers in respect of historical payments under derivative contracts, the expected write-off by the bank of open derivative contract balances, and estimated project costs. An increase in the provision of US$288m was recorded during the year, reflecting updated claims experience and the announcement by the FCA on 28 January 2015 of the extension of the scheme to 31 March 2015, and expectation of an additional population who will opt into the scheme following communications to affected customers. The extent to which HSBC is ultimately required to pay redress depends on the responses of contacted and other customers during the review period and analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual case, including consequential loss claims received. For these reasons, there is currently a high degree of uncertainty as to the eventual costs of redress related to this programme. UK Consumer Credit Act HSBC has undertaken a review of compliance with the fixed-sum unsecured loan agreement requirements of the UK Consumer Credit Act (CCA). US$379m has been recognised at 31 December 2014 within Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities for the repayment of interest to customers, primarily where annual statements did not remind them of their right to partially prepay the loan, notwithstanding that the customer loan documentation did refer to this right. The cumulative liability to date is US$591m, of which payments of US$212m have been made to customers. There is uncertainty as to whether other technical requirements of the CCA have been met, for which we have assessed the contingent liability as up to US$0.9bn. Brazilian labour, civil and fiscal claims Within Legal proceedings and regulatory matters above are labour, civil and fiscal litigation provisions of US$501m (2013: US$500m). Of these provisions, US$246m (2013: US$232m) was in respect of labour and overtime litigation claims brought by past employees against HSBC operations in Brazil following their departure from the bank. The main assumptions involved in estimating the liability are the expected number of departing employees, individual salary levels and the facts and circumstances of each individual case.

Additional tier 1 capital securities Additional tier 1 capital securities are included in HSBCs capital base as tier 1 capital and are perpetual subordinated securities on which investors are entitled, subject to certain conditions, to receive distributions which are non-cumulative. Such securities do not generally carry voting rights but rank above ordinary shares for coupon payments and in the event of a winding-up. The eligibility criteria for tier 1 securities changed on the introduction of CRD IV rules on 1 January 2014. For further guidance on the criteria for additional tier 1 securities, see note 35. Instruments issued before CRD IV comes into effect which do not meet the identifying criteria in full are eligible as regulatory capital subject to grandfathering limits and progressive phase-out. Capital securities that have been issued during 2014 are recognised as fully CRD IV compliant additional tier 1 capital securities on an end point basis and are accounted for as equity and detailed in Note 35. Guaranteed by HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank The six capital securities guaranteed on a subordinated basis by HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank are non-cumulative step-up perpetual preferred securities issued by Jersey limited partnerships. The proceeds of the issues were on-lent to the respective guarantors by the limited partnerships in the form of subordinated notes. These preferred securities qualify as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC under CRD IV by virtue of application of grandfathering provisions and the two capital securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank also qualify as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC Bank (on a solo and a consolidated basis) under CRD IV by virtue of application of grandfathering provisions. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 425 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) These preferred securities, together with the guarantee, are intended to provide investors with economic rights equivalent to the rights that they would have had if they had purchased non-cumulative perpetual preference shares of the relevant issuer. There are limitations on the payment of distributions if such payments are prohibited under UK banking regulations or other requirements, if a payment would cause a breach of HSBCs capital adequacy requirements or if HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank have insufficient distributable reserves (as defined). HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank have individually covenanted that if prevented under certain circumstances from paying distributions on the preferred securities in full, they will not pay dividends or other distributions in respect of their ordinary shares, or effect repurchases or redemptions of their ordinary shares, until the distribution on the preferred securities has been paid in full. With respect to preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Holdings  if (i) HSBCs total capital ratio falls below the regulatory minimum ratio required, or (ii) the Directors expect, in view of the deteriorating financial condition of HSBC Holdings, that (i) will occur in the near term, then the preferred securities will be substituted by preference shares of HSBC Holdings which have economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to those of the preferred securities and the guarantee taken together. With respect to preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank  if (i) any of the two issues of preferred securities are outstanding in April 2049 or November 2048, respectively, or (ii) the total capital ratio of HSBC Bank on a solo and consolidated basis falls below the regulatory minimum ratio required, or (iii) in view of the deteriorating financial condition of HSBC Bank, the Directors expect (ii) to occur in the near term, then the preferred securities will be substituted by preference shares of HSBC Bank having economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to those of the preferred securities and the guarantee taken together. Tier 2 capital securities These capital securities are included within HSBCs capital base as tier 2 capital under CRD IV by virtue of application of grandfathering provisions (with the exception of identified HSBC Holding securities which are compliant with CRD IV end point rules). Tier 2 capital securities are either perpetual subordinated securities or dated securities on which there is an obligation to pay coupons. In accordance with CRD IV, the capital contribution of all tier 2 securities is amortised for regulatory purposes in their final five years before maturity. 31 Maturity analysis of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments The table on page 427 provides an analysis of consolidated total assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments by residual contractual maturity at the balance sheet date. Asset and liability balances are included in the maturity analysis as follows:  except for reverse repos, repos and debt securities in issue, trading assets and liabilities (including trading derivatives) are included in the Due not more than 1 month time bucket, and not by contractual maturity because trading balances are typically held for short periods of time;  financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity (such as equity securities) are included in the Due over 5 years time bucket. Undated or perpetual instruments are classified based on the contractual notice period which the counterparty of the instrument is entitled to give. Where there is no contractual notice period, undated or perpetual contracts are included in the Due over 5 years time bucket;  non-financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity (such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and retirement benefit liabilities) are included in the Due over 5 years time bucket;  financial instruments included within assets and liabilities of disposal groups held for sale are classified on the basis of the contractual maturity of the underlying instruments and not on the basis of the disposal transaction; and  liabilities under insurance contracts are included in the Due over 5 years time bucket. Liabilities under investment contracts are classified in accordance with their contractual maturity. Undated investment contracts are classified based on the contractual notice period investors are entitled to give. Where there is no contractual notice period, undated contracts are included in the Due over 5 years time bucket. Loan and other credit-related commitments are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be drawn down.

Dividends on the HSBC Holdings non-cumulative dollar preference shares in issue (dollar preference shares) are paid quarterly at the sole and absolute discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will not declare a dividend on the dollar preference shares if payment of the dividend would cause HSBC Holdings not to meet the applicable capital adequacy requirements of the PRA or the profit of HSBC Holdings available for distribution as dividends is not sufficient to enable HSBC Holdings to pay in full both dividends on the dollar preference shares and dividends on any other shares that are scheduled to be paid on the same date and that have an equal right to dividends. HSBC Holdings may not declare or pay dividends on any class of its shares ranking lower in the right to dividends than the dollar preference shares nor redeem nor purchase in any manner any of its other shares ranking equal with or lower than the dollar preference shares unless it has paid in full, or set aside an amount to provide for payment in full, the dividends on the dollar preference shares for the then current dividend period. The dollar preference shares carry no rights to conversion into ordinary shares of HSBC Holdings. Holders of the dollar preference shares will only be entitled to attend and vote at general meetings of shareholders of HSBC Holdings if the dividend payable on the dollar preference shares has not been paid in full for four consecutive dividend payment dates. In such circumstances, holders of the dollar preference shares will be entitled to vote on all matters put to general meetings until such time as HSBC Holdings has paid a full dividend on the dollar preference shares. HSBC Holdings may redeem the dollar preference shares in whole at any time on or after 16 December 2010, subject to prior notification to the PRA. HSBC Holdings non-cumulative preference share of £0.01 The one non-cumulative sterling preference share of £0.01 in issue (sterling preference share) has been in issue since 29 December 2010 and is held by a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings.

While any coupon payments are unpaid or deferred, HSBC Holdings will not declare, pay dividends or make distributions or similar periodic payments in respect of, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities of lower or equal rank. Such securities do not generally carry voting rights but rank higher than ordinary shares for coupon payments and in the event of a winding-up. These securities have been included in the capital base of HSBC in accordance with CRD IV rules by virtue of the application of grandfathering provisions. At HSBC Holdings discretion, and subject to certain conditions being satisfied, the capital securities may be exchanged on any coupon payment date for non-cumulative preference shares to be issued by HSBC Holdings and ranking pari passu with the dollar and sterling preference shares in issue. The preference shares would be issued at a nominal value of US$0.01 per share and a premium of US$24.99 per share, with both such amounts being subscribed and fully paid. These securities may be called and redeemed by HSBC subject to prior notification to the PRA.

The net proceeds of the issuances will be used for general corporate purposes and to further strengthen the capital base pursuant to requirements under CRD IV. These securities bear a fixed rate of interest until their initial call dates. After the initial call dates, in the event they are not redeemed, the securities will bear interest at rates which are fixed periodically in advance for five year periods based on prevailing market rates. Interest on the contingent convertible securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of HSBC, and HSBC has sole and absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any interest payment date. There are limitations on the payment of distributions if such payments are prohibited under UK banking regulations, or other requirements, if HSBC Holdings has insufficient reserves available for distribution or if HSBC fails to satisfy the solvency condition as defined in the securities terms. The contingent convertible securities are undated and are repayable, at the option of HSBC, in whole at the initial call date, or on any fifth anniversary after the initial call date. In addition, the securities are repayable at the option of HSBC in whole for certain regulatory or tax reasons. Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA. These securities rank pari passu with HSBCs dollar and sterling preference shares and are therefore ahead of ordinary shares. The contingent convertible securities will be converted into ordinary shares of HSBC, at a pre-determined price, should HSBCs consolidated, end-point CET1 ratio fall below 7.0%.

Disposal of subsidiaries and businesses During 2014, we completed the disposals of HSBC Bank Middle East Limiteds banking business in Jordan and operations in Pakistan. This resulted in a net US$303m outflow of cash and cash equivalents which is included under Cash flow from investing activities in the Consolidated statement of cash flows on page 338. In October 2013, we completed the disposal of HSBC Bank (Panama) S.A., receiving total cash consideration of US$2,210m which is included under Cash flow from investing activities in the Consolidated statement of cash flows on page 338.

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of settlement is remote. Financial guarantee contracts Liabilities under financial guarantee contracts which are not classified as insurance contracts are recorded initially at their fair value, which is generally the fee received or present value of the fee receivable. Subsequently, financial guarantee liabilities are measured at the higher of the initial fair value, less cumulative amortisation, and the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations. HSBC Holdings has issued financial guarantees and similar contracts to other Group entities. HSBC elects to account for certain guarantees as insurance contracts in HSBC Holdings financial statements, in which case they are measured and recognised as insurance liabilities. This election is made on a contract by contract basis, and is irrevocable.

Contingent liabilities arising from legal proceedings, regulatory and other matters against Group companies are disclosed in Notes 29 and 40. Nominal principal amounts represent the amounts at risk should the contracts be fully drawn upon and clients default. As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not indicative of future liquidity requirements. Social Security tax claims in Brazil In April 2008, a final judicial decision was issued in favour of HSBC insurance and leasing companies in Brazil, clarifying that the Profit participation contribution (PIS) and the Social security financing contribution (COFINS) should only be levied on the revenues from the sale of goods and services and not on income derived from insurance premiums and financial revenue. The resulting reduction of the tax basis and the offsetting of tax credits was made by HSBC at that time, in accordance with this decision, but later challenged by the Brazilian tax authority claiming that the basis of those taxes should include all revenues from the corporate activity of the tax payer. With the enactment of a new law in force from 1 January 2015, the tax base for PIS and COFINS has been expanded to include all revenue from corporate activity, including insurance and financing income; therefore, any possible obligation for HSBC to pay any additional taxes only relates to tax years up to the end of 2014. These tax assessments are in various stages of the administrative process. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable for HSBC to predict the timing of the resolution of these matters.

The amounts disclosed in the above table are nominal principal amounts and reflect HSBCs maximum exposure under a large number of individual guarantee undertakings. The risks and exposures arising from guarantees are captured and managed in accordance with HSBCs overall credit risk management policies and procedures. Approximately half of the above guarantees have a term of less than one year. Guarantees with terms of more than one year are subject to HSBCs annual credit review process. Financial Services Compensation Scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) has provided compensation to consumers following the collapse of a number of deposit takers. The compensation paid out to consumers is currently funded through loans from the Bank of England and HM Treasury which at 31 December 2014 stood at approximately £16bn (US$24.9bn). In order to repay the loan principal which is not expected to be recovered, the FSCS levies participating financial institutions. In January 2015, the FSCS announced that the expected levy on participating financial institutions for Scheme Year 2015/2016 would be £347m (US$541m) (2014/2015: £399m (US$660m)). The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the collapses cannot currently be estimated reliably as it is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS and changes in the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time. Capital commitments In addition to the commitments disclosed on page 441, at 31 December 2014 HSBC had US$656m (2013: US$401m) of capital commitments contracted but not provided for and US$101m (2013: US$112m) of capital commitments authorised but not contracted for. Associates HSBCs share of associates contingent liabilities amounted to US$47,593m at 31 December 2014 (2013: US$46,574m). No matters arose where HSBC was severally liable. 38 Lease commitments Accounting policy Agreements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of assets are classified as finance leases. As a lessor under finance leases, HSBC presents the amounts due under the leases, after deduction of unearned charges, in Loans and advances to banks or Loans and advances to customers. As a lessee under finance leases, HSBC presents the leased assets in Property, plant and equipment with the corresponding liability included in Other liabilities. A finance lease asset and its corresponding liability are recognised initially at the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. All other leases are classified as operating leases. As lessor, HSBC presents assets subject to operating leases in Property, plant and equipment. Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that carrying values are not fully recoverable. As a lessee, leased assets are not recognised on the balance sheet. Finance income or charges on the finance lease are recognised in Net interest income over the lease periods so as to give a constant rate of return. Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease periods and are recognised in General and administrative expenses or in Other operating income. Operating lease commitments At 31 December 2014, future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases for land, buildings and equipment were US$5,372m (2013 US$5,496m). HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 442 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Finance lease receivables HSBC leases a variety of assets to third parties under finance leases, including transport assets (such as aircraft), property and general plant and machinery. At the end of lease terms, assets may be sold to third parties or leased for further terms. Rentals are calculated to recover the cost of assets less their residual value, and earn finance income. 2014 2013 Total futureminimum payments US$m Unearned finance income US$m Present value US$m Total futureminimum payments US$m Unearned finance income US$m Present value US$m Lease receivables:  no later than one year 3,383 (374 ) 3,009 3,370 (360 ) 3,010  later than one year and no later than five years 8,089 (980 ) 7,109 7,933 (990 ) 6,943  later than five years 5,013 (744 ) 4,269 5,064 (856 ) 4,208 At 31 December 16,485 (2,098 ) 14,387 16,367 (2,206 ) 14,161 39 Structured entities Accounting policy A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, for example when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, and key activities are directed by contractual arrangements. Structured entities often have restricted activities and a narrow and well defined objective. Structured entities are assessed for consolidation in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 1(h). HSBC is involved with structured entities, mainly through securitisation of financial assets, conduits and investment funds. HSBC arrangements that involve structured entities are authorised centrally when they are established to ensure appropriate purpose and governance. The activities of structured entities administered by HSBC are closely monitored by senior management. HSBC has involvement with both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities, which may be established by HSBC or by a third party, as detailed below. Consolidated structured entities Total assets of HSBCs consolidated structured entities, split by entity type ConduitsUS$bn SecuritisationsUS$bn HSBC managed fundsUS$bn Other US$bn Total US$bn At 31 December 2014 27.2 7.9 11.2 6.7 53.0 At 31 December 2013 38.9 7.1 13.9 8.2 68.1 Conduits HSBC has established and manages two types of conduits: securities investment conduits (SICs) and multi-seller conduits. These entities have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who has control; in such cases, the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangement. The conduits are consolidated as HSBC is exposed or has the right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect its returns through its power over the entity. Securities investment conduits Solitaire, HSBCs principal SIC, purchases highly rated ABSs to facilitate tailored investment opportunities. At 31 December 2014, Solitaire held US$8.0bn of ABSs (2013: US$9.0bn). These are included within the disclosures of ABSs held through consolidated structured entities on page 162. HSBCs other SICs, Mazarin, Barion and Malachite, evolved from the restructuring of HSBCs structured investment vehicles in 2008.  Solitaire  Solitaire is currently funded entirely by commercial paper CP issued to HSBC. Although HSBC continues to provide a liquidity facility, Solitaire has no need to draw on it so long as HSBC purchases the CP issued, which it intends to do for the foreseeable future. At 31 December 2014, HSBC held US$9.5bn of CP (2013: US$11.0bn).  Mazarin  HSBC is exposed to the par value of Mazarins assets through the provision of a liquidity facility equal to the lesser of the amortised cost of issued senior debt and the amortised cost of non-defaulted assets. At 31 December 2014, this amounted to US$3.9bn (2013: US$7.4bn). First loss protection is provided through the capital notes issued by Mazarin, which are substantially all held by third parties. At 31 December 2014, HSBC held 1.2% of Mazarins capital notes (2013: 1.3%) with a par value of US$10m (2013: US$17m) and a carrying amount of US$1.4m (2013: US$0.3m). HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 443 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued)  Barion and Malachite  HSBCs primary exposure to these SICs is represented by the amortised cost of the debt required to support the non-cash assets of the vehicles. At 31 December 2014, this amounted to US$3.0bn (2013: US$6.3bn). First loss protection is provided through the capital notes issued by these vehicles, which are substantially all held by third parties. At 31 December 2014, HSBC held 9.9% of the capital notes (2013: 3.8%) issued by these vehicles with a par value of US$54.8m (2013: US$37m) and a carrying amount of US$10.1m (2013: US$3.3m). Multi-seller conduits These vehicles were established for the purpose of providing access to flexible market-based sources of finance for HSBCs clients. HSBC bears risk equal to transaction-specific liquidity facilities offered to the multi-seller conduits amounting to US$15.4bn at 31 December 2014 (2013: US$15.7bn). First loss protection is provided by the originator of the assets, and not by HSBC, through transaction-specific credit enhancements. A layer of secondary loss protection is provided by HSBC in the form of programme-wide enhancement facilities. Securitisations HSBC uses structured entities to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated in order to diversify its sources of funding for asset origination and capital efficiency purposes. The loans and advances are transferred by HSBC to the structured entities for cash or synthetically through credit default swaps, and the structured entities issue debt securities to investors. HSBC managed funds HSBC has established a number of money market and non-money market funds. Where it is deemed to be acting as principal rather than agent in its role as investment manager, HSBC controls and hence consolidates these funds. Other HSBC has also entered into a number of transactions in the normal course of business which include asset and structured finance transactions where it has control of the structured entity. In addition, HSBC is deemed to control a number of third-party managed funds through its involvement as a principal in the funds. Unconsolidated structured entities The term unconsolidated structured entities refers to all structured entities that are not controlled by HSBC. HSBC enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities. The table below shows the total assets of unconsolidated structured entities in which HSBC had an interest at the reporting date and its maximum exposure to loss in relation to those interests.

The maximum exposure to loss from HSBCs interests in unconsolidated structured entities represents the maximum loss that HSBC could incur as a result of HSBCs involvement with unconsolidated structured entities regardless of the probability of the loss being incurred.  For commitments and guarantees, and written credit default swaps, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.  For retained and purchased investments in and loans to unconsolidated structured entities, the maximum exposure to loss is the carrying value of these interests at the balance sheet reporting date. The maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate HSBCs exposure to loss. Securitisations HSBC has interests in unconsolidated securitisation vehicles through holding notes issued by these entities. In addition, HSBC has investments in asset-backed securities issued by third party structured entities as set out on page 162. HSBC managed funds HSBC establishes and manages money market funds and non-money market investment funds to provide customers with investment opportunities. Further information on Funds under management is provided on page 106. HSBC, as fund manager, may be entitled to receive management and performance fees based on the assets under management. HSBC may also retain units in these funds. Non-HSBC managed funds HSBC purchases and holds units of third-party managed funds in order to facilitate both business and customer needs. In addition, HSBC enters into derivative contracts to facilitate risk management solutions for non-HSBC managed funds. At 31 December 2014, the fair value of HSBCs derivative exposures to non-HSBC managed funds was US$6.5bn. Note 16 sets out information in respect of derivatives entered into by HSBC. Other HSBC has established structured entities in the normal course of business such as structured credit transactions for customers, to provide finance to public and private sector infrastructure projects, and for asset and structured finance transactions. HSBC sponsored structured entities Accounting policy HSBC is considered to sponsor another entity if, in addition to ongoing involvement with the entity, it had a key role in establishing that entity or in bringing together the relevant counterparties so that the transaction, which is the purpose of the entity, could occur. HSBC is generally not considered a sponsor if the only involvement with the entity is merely administrative in nature. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 445 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) The amount of assets transferred to and income received from such sponsored entities during 2014 and 2013 was not significant. 40 Legal proceedings and regulatory matters HSBC is party to legal proceedings and regulatory matters in a number of jurisdictions arising out of its normal business operations. Apart from the matters described below, HSBC considers that none of these matters are material. The recognition of provisions is determined in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 29. While the outcome of legal proceedings and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, management believes that, based on the information available to it, appropriate provisions have been made in respect of these matters as at 31 December 2014 (see Note 29). Where an individual provision is material, the fact that a provision has been made is stated and quantified. Any provision recognised does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. It is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of potential liability for our legal proceedings and regulatory matters as a class of contingent liabilities. Securities litigation As a result of an August 2002 restatement of previously reported consolidated financial statements and other corporate events, including the 2002 settlement with 46 states and the District of Columbia relating to real estate lending practices, Household International and certain former officers were named as defendants in a class action lawsuit, Jaffe v. Household International, Inc., et al., filed in August 2002 in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the Illinois District Court). The complaint asserted claims under the US Securities Exchange Act and alleged that the defendants knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading statements of material fact relating to Household Internationals Consumer Lending operations, including collections, sales and lending practices, some of which ultimately led to the 2002 state settlement agreement, and facts relating to accounting practices evidenced by the restatement. Ultimately, a class was certified on behalf of all persons who acquired and disposed of Household International common stock between July 1999 and October 2002. A jury trial concluded in April 2009, which was decided partly in favour of the plaintiffs. Various legal challenges to the verdict were raised in post-trial briefing. In December 2011, following the submission of claim forms by class members, the court-appointed claims administrator to the Illinois District Court reported that the total number of claims that generated an allowed loss was 45,921, and that the aggregate amount of these claims was approximately US$2.2bn. The defendants filed legal challenges regarding the presumption of reliance as to the class and compliance with the claim form requirements, which the Illinois District Court, in September 2012, rejected for the most part. The Illinois District Court directed further proceedings before a court-appointed Special Master to address certain claims submission issues. In October 2013, the Illinois District Court denied the defendants additional post-trial motions for judgement as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial, and granted plaintiffs motions for a partial final judgement and awarded pre-judgement interest at the prime rate, compounded annually. Subsequently, in October 2013, the Illinois District Court entered a partial final judgement against the defendants in the amount of approximately US$2.5bn (including pre-judgement interest). In addition to the partial judgement that has been entered, there also remain approximately US$625m in claims, prior to imposition of pre-judgement interest, that still are subject to objections that have not yet been ruled upon by the Illinois District Court. The defendants filed a Notice of Appeal of the partial final judgement, and oral argument was heard by the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (the Court of Appeals) in May 2014. We await a decision from the Court of Appeals. The defendants have also filed a supersedeas bond in the approximate amount of the partial final judgement (US$2.5bn) in order to stay execution on the judgement pending appeal. Despite the jury verdict, the various rulings of the Illinois District Court, and the partial final judgement, we continue to believe that we have meritorious grounds for relief on appeal. The timing and outcome of the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain. Given the complexity and uncertainties associated with the actual determination of damages, including the outcome of any appeals, there is a wide range of possible outcomes. If the Court of Appeals rejects or only partially accepts our arguments, the amount of damages, based upon that partial final judgement, and other pending claims and the application of pre-judgement interest on those pending claims, may lie in a range from a relatively insignificant amount to an amount up to or exceeding US$3.6bn. Once a judgement is entered (such as the approximately US$2.5bn partial final judgement entered in October 2013), post-judgement interest accrues on the judgement at a rate equal to the weekly average of the one-year constant maturity treasury yield as published by the Federal Reserve System. A provision has been made based on managements best estimate of probable outflows. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 446 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC Bernard L. Madoff (Madoff) was arrested in December 2008, and ultimately pleaded guilty to running a Ponzi scheme. He has acknowledged, in essence, that while purporting to invest his customers money in securities, he in fact never invested in securities and used other customers money to fulfil requests to return investments. His firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (Madoff Securities), is being liquidated by a trustee (the Trustee). Various non-US HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds incorporated outside the US whose assets were invested with Madoff Securities. Based on information provided by Madoff Securities, as at 30 November 2008, the purported aggregate value of these funds was US$8.4bn, an amount that includes fictitious profits reported by Madoff. Based on information available to HSBC, we have estimated that the funds actual transfers to Madoff Securities minus their actual withdrawals from Madoff Securities during the time that HSBC serviced the funds totalled approximately US$4bn. Various HSBC companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of Madoff Securities fraud. US/UK Litigation: The Trustee has brought suits against various HSBC companies in the US Bankruptcy Court and in the English High Court. The Trustees US actions included common law claims, alleging that HSBC aided and abetted Madoffs fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. Those claims were dismissed on grounds of lack of standing. The Trustees remaining US claims seek recovery of prepetition transfers pursuant to US bankruptcy law. The amount of these remaining claims has not been pleaded or determined as against HSBC. Alpha Prime Fund Ltd (Alpha Prime) and Senator Fund SPC, co-defendants in the Trustees US actions, have brought cross-claims against HSBC. These funds have also sued HSBC in Luxembourg (discussed below). The Trustees English action seeks recovery of unspecified transfers from Madoff Securities to or through HSBC. HSBC has not yet been served with the Trustees English action. The Trustees deadline for serving the claim has been extended through the third quarter of 2015. Fairfield Sentry Limited, Fairfield Sigma Limited and Fairfield Lambda Limited (collectively, Fairfield), funds whose assets were invested with Madoff Securities, commenced multiple suits in the US and the British Virgin Islands (the BVI) against fund shareholders, including various HSBC companies that acted as nominees for HSBC clients, seeking restitution of payments made in connection with share redemptions. The US actions brought by Fairfield are stayed pending the outcome of the Fairfield cases in the BVI (discussed below). In September 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of purported class action claims against HSBC and others brought by investors in three Madoff-invested funds on grounds of forum non conveniens. The plaintiffs petitions for certiorari to the US Supreme Court were filed in December 2014. The Supreme Courts decision on whether to grant certiorari review is expected in the first half of 2015. In December 2014, three new Madoff-related actions were filed. The first is a purported class action brought by direct investors in Madoff Securities who were holding their investments as of December 2008, asserting various common law claims and seeking to recover damages lost to Madoff Securities fraud on account of HSBCs purported knowledge and alleged furtherance of the fraud. The other two actions were filed by SPV Optimal SUS Ltd (SPV Optimal), the purported assignee of the Madoff Securities-invested company, Optimal Strategic US Equity Ltd. One of these actions was filed in New York state court and the other in US federal district court. In January 2015, SPV Optimal dismissed its federal lawsuit against HSBC. The state court action against HSBC remains pending. BVI Litigation: Beginning in October 2009, the Fairfield funds, whose assets were directly or indirectly invested with Madoff Securities, commenced multiple suits in the BVI against numerous fund shareholders, including various HSBC companies that acted as nominees for clients of HSBCs private banking business and other clients who invested in the Fairfield funds. The Fairfield funds are seeking restitution of redemption payments made by the funds to defendants on the grounds that they were mistakenly based on inflated net asset values. In April 2014, the UK Privy Council issued a ruling on two preliminary issues in favour of other defendants in the BVI actions, and issued its order in October 2014. There is also a pending motion brought by other defendants before the BVI court challenging the Fairfield liquidators authorisation to pursue its claims in the US. The BVI court has adjourned the hearing on that pending motion until March 2015. Bermuda Litigation: In January 2009, Kingate Global Fund Limited and Kingate Euro Fund Limited (collectively, Kingate), funds whose assets were directly or indirectly invested with Madoff Securities, commenced an action in Bermuda against HSBC Bank Bermuda Limited for recovery of funds held in Kingates accounts, fees and dividends. This action is currently pending, but is not expected to move forward until there is a resolution as to the Trustees separate US actions against Kingate and HSBC Bank Bermuda Limited. Thema Fund Limited (Thema) and Hermes International Fund Limited (Hermes), funds invested with Madoff Securities, each also brought three actions in Bermuda in 2009. The first set of actions were brought against HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Bermuda) Limited and seek recovery of funds in frozen accounts held at HSBC. The second set of actions asserts liability against HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Bermuda) Limited in relation to claims for mistake, recovery of fees and damages for breach of contract. The third set of actions seeks return of fees from HSBC Bank Bermuda Limited and HSBC Securities Services (Bermuda). There has been little progress in these actions for several years, although in January 2015, Thema and Hermes served notice of intent to proceed in respect of the second set of actions referred to above. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 447 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Cayman Islands Litigation: In February 2013, Primeo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based fund invested in Madoff Securities, brought an action against the fund administrator, Bank of Bermuda (Cayman), and the fund custodian, HSBC Securities Services (Luxembourg) (HSSL), alleging breaches of contract. Primeo Fund claims damages from defendants to compensate it for alleged losses, including loss of profit and any liability to the Trustee. Trial has been postponed to January 2016. Luxembourg Litigation: In April 2009, Herald Fund SPC (Herald) (in official liquidation since July 2013) commenced action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court seeking restitution of all cash and securities Herald purportedly lost because of Madoff Securities fraud, or in the alternative, money damages in the same amount. In March 2013, the Luxembourg District Court dismissed Heralds restitution claim for the return of the securities. Heralds restitution claim for return of the cash and claim for money damages were reserved. Herald appealed this judgement in May 2013. Judgement on the issue of a judicial bond is expected to be rendered in May 2015. Proceedings on the reserved restitution claim were suspended pending resolution of the appeal. In October 2009, Alpha Prime sued HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court, alleging breach of contract and negligence in the appointment of Madoff Securities as a sub-custodian of Alpha Primes assets. Alpha Prime was ordered to provide a judicial bond. Alpha Prime requested a stay of these proceedings pending its negotiations with the Trustee in the US proceedings. The matter has been temporarily suspended. In March 2010, Herald (Lux) SICAV (Herald (Lux)) (in official liquidation since April 2009) brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court seeking restitution of securities, or the cash equivalent, or money damages in the alternative. Herald (Lux) has also requested the restitution of fees paid to HSSL as custodian and service agent of the fund. The last preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place in March 2015. In December 2014, Senator Fund SPC commenced an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking the restitution of securities held as of the latest net asset value statement from November 2008, or in the alternative, money damages. The first preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place in February 2015. HSSL has been sued in various actions by shareholders in the Primeo Select Fund, Herald, Herald (Lux), and Hermes funds. These actions are in different stages, most of which have been dismissed, suspended or postponed. Ireland Litigation: In November 2013, Defender Limited, a fund invested with Madoff securities, commenced an action against HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Ireland) Limited (HTIE), alleging breach of the custodian agreement and claiming damages and indemnification for claims against Defender Limited for fund losses. The action also includes four non-HSBC parties, who served as directors and investment managers to Defender Limited. In July 2013 and December 2013, settlements were reached in respect of claims filed against HTIE in the Irish High Court by Thema International Fund plc (Thema International) and Alternative Advantage Plc (AA), respectively. Five actions by individual Thema International shareholders remain pending. In December 2014, a new proceeding against HTIE and HSBC Securities Services (Ireland) Limited was brought by SPV Optimal, alleging breach of the custodian agreement and claiming damages and indemnification for fund losses. There are many factors that may affect the range of possible outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of the various Madoff-related proceedings described above, including but not limited to the multiple jurisdictions in which the proceedings have been brought and the number of different plaintiffs and defendants in such proceedings. For these reasons, amongst others, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to estimate reliably the aggregate liabilities, or ranges of liabilities, that might arise as a result of all claims in the various Madoff-related proceedings, but they could be significant. US mortgage-related investigations In April 2011, following completion of a broad horizontal review of industry residential mortgage foreclosure practices, HSBC Bank USA N.A. (HSBC Bank USA) entered into a consent cease-and-desist order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC). HSBC Finance Corporation (HSBC Finance) and HSBC North America Holdings Inc. (HNAH) also entered into a similar consent order with the Federal Reserve Board (the FRB) (together with the OCC order, the Servicing Consent Orders). The Servicing Consent Orders require prescribed actions to address the deficiencies noted in the joint examination and described in the consent orders. HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance and HNAH continue to work with the OCC and the FRB to align their processes with the requirements of the consent orders and are implementing operational changes as required. Pursuant to the Servicing Consent Orders, an independent consultant was retained to conduct an independent review of foreclosures pending or completed between January 2009 and December 2010 (the Independent Foreclosure Review) to determine if any borrower was financially injured as a result of an error in the foreclosure process. In February 2013, HSBC Bank USA entered into an agreement with the OCC, and HSBC Finance and HNAH entered into an agreement with the FRB (together, the IFR Settlement Agreements), pursuant to which the Independent Foreclosure Review was replaced by a broader framework under which HSBC and 12 other participating servicers agreed to provide, in the aggregate, over HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 448 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) US$9.3bn in cash payments and other assistance to help eligible borrowers. Pursuant to the IFR Settlement Agreements, HNAH made a cash payment of US$96m into a fund used to make payments to borrowers that were in active foreclosure during 2009 and 2010, and in addition, is providing other assistance (e.g. loan modifications) to help eligible borrowers. Borrowers who receive compensation will not be required to execute a release or waiver of rights and will not be precluded from pursuing litigation concerning foreclosure or other mortgage servicing practices. For participating servicers, including HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Finance, fulfilment of the terms of the IFR Settlement Agreements will satisfy the Independent Foreclosure Review requirements of the Servicing Consent Orders, including the wind-down of the Independent Foreclosure Review. The Servicing Consent Orders do not preclude additional enforcement actions against HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance or HNAH by bank regulatory, governmental or law enforcement agencies, such as the US Department of Justice (the DoJ) or state Attorneys General, which could include the imposition of civil money penalties and other sanctions relating to the activities that are the subject of the Servicing Consent Orders. Pursuant to the IFR Settlement Agreement with the OCC, however, the OCC has agreed that it will not assess civil money penalties or initiate any further enforcement action with respect to past mortgage servicing and foreclosure-related practices addressed in the Servicing Consent Orders, provided the terms of the IFR Settlement Agreements are fulfilled. The OCCs agreement not to assess civil money penalties is further conditioned on HNAH making payments or providing borrower assistance pursuant to any agreement that may be entered into with the DoJ in connection with the servicing of residential mortgage loans. The FRB has agreed that any assessment of civil money penalties by the FRB will reflect a number of adjustments, including amounts expended in consumer relief and payments made pursuant to any agreement that may be entered into with the DoJ in connection with the servicing of residential mortgage loans. The IFR Settlement Agreements do not preclude private litigation concerning these practices. Separate from the Servicing Consent Orders and the settlements related to the Independent Foreclosure Review discussed above, in February 2012, five of the largest US mortgage servicers (not including any HSBC companies) reached a settlement with the DoJ, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and state Attorneys General of 49 states with respect to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices. Following the February 2012 settlement, these government agencies initiated discussions with other mortgage industry servicers, including HSBC, HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance and HNAH have had discussions with US bank regulators and other governmental agencies regarding a potential resolution. Any such settlement, however, may not completely preclude other enforcement actions by state or federal agencies, bank regulators or law enforcement bodies related to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices, including, but not limited to, matters relating to the securitisation of mortgages for investors. These practices have in the past resulted in private litigation, and such a settlement would not preclude further private litigation concerning these practices. US mortgage securitisation activity and litigation HSBC Bank USA has been involved as a sponsor/seller of loans used to facilitate whole loan securitisations underwritten by HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (HSI). From 2005 to 2007, HSBC Bank USA purchased and sold US$24bn of such loans to HSI which were subsequently securitised and sold by HSI to third parties. The outstanding principal balance on these loans was approximately US$5.7bn as at 31 December 2014. Participants in the US mortgage securitisation market that purchased and repackaged whole loans have been the subject of lawsuits and governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries, which have been directed at groups within the US mortgage market such as servicers, originators, underwriters, trustees or sponsors of securitisations, and at particular participants within these groups. As the industrys residential mortgage foreclosure issues continue, HSBC Bank USA has taken title to an increasing number of foreclosed homes as trustee on behalf of various securitisation trusts. As nominal record owner of these properties, HSBC Bank USA has been sued by municipalities and tenants alleging various violations of law, including laws regarding property upkeep and tenants rights. While HSBC believes and continues to maintain that the obligations at issue and any related liabilities are properly those of the servicer of each trust, HSBC continues to receive significant adverse publicity in connection with these and similar matters, including foreclosures that are serviced by others in the name of HSBC, as trustee. Between June and December 2014, a number of lawsuits were filed in state and federal court in New York against HSBC Bank USA as trustee of over 250 mortgage securitisation trusts. These lawsuits are brought derivatively on behalf of the trusts by a class of investors including, amongst others, BlackRock and PIMCO funds. Similar lawsuits were filed simultaneously against other non-HSBC financial institutions that served as mortgage securitisation pool trustees. The complaints against HSBC Bank USA allege that the trusts have sustained losses in collateral value of over US$34bn. The lawsuits seek unspecified damages resulting from alleged breaches of the US Trust Indenture Act, breach of fiduciary duties, negligence, breach of contract and breach of the common law duty of trust. HSBC filed a motion to dismiss three of these lawsuits in January 2015. Various HSBC companies have also been named as defendants in a number of actions in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) offerings, which generally allege that the offering documents for securities issued by securitisation trusts contained material misstatements and omissions, including statements regarding the underwriting standards governing the underlying mortgage loans. In September 2011, an action was filed by the Federal Housing HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 449 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) Finance Agency (FHFA), acting in its capacity as conservator for the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (the New York District Court) against HSBC Bank USA, HNAH, HSI and HSI Asset Securitization (HASCO), as well as five former and current officers and directors of HASCO. FHFA sought money damages or rescission of mortgage-backed securities purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that were either underwritten or sponsored by HSBC companies. As announced in September 2014, this matter was resolved between the parties by final settlement requiring HSBC to pay a total of US$550m to FHFA. HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance and Decision One Mortgage Company LLC (an indirect subsidiary of HSBC Finance) have been named as defendants in various mortgage loan repurchase actions brought by trustees of securitisation trusts. In the aggregate, these actions seek to have the HSBC defendants repurchase mortgage loans, or pay compensatory damages in lieu of repurchase totalling at least US$1bn. Motions to dismiss have been filed and are fully briefed and pending in two of these actions. Since 2010, various HSBC entities have received subpoenas and requests for information from US authorities seeking the production of documents and information regarding HSBCs involvement, and the involvement of its affiliates, in particular private-label RMBS transactions as an issuer, sponsor, underwriter, depositor, trustee, custodian or servicer. HSBC continues to cooperate with these US authorities. In November 2014, HNAH, on behalf of itself and various subsidiaries including, but not limited to, HSBC Bank USA, HASCO, HSI, HSI Asset Loan Obligation, HSBC Mortgage Corporation (USA), HSBC Finance and Decision One Mortgage Company LLC, received a subpoena from the US Attorneys Office for the District of Colorado, pursuant to the Financial Industry Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, concerning the origination, financing, purchase, securitisation and servicing of subprime and non-subprime residential mortgages. This matter is at an early stage and HSBC is cooperating fully. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC. HSBC expects the focus on mortgage securitisations to continue. As a result, HSBC companies may be subject to additional claims, litigation and governmental or regulatory scrutiny relating to its participation in the US mortgage securitisation market, either as a member of a group or individually. Anti-money laundering and sanctions-related matters In October 2010, HSBC Bank USA entered into a consent cease-and-desist order with the OCC, and HNAH entered into a consent cease-and-desist order with the FRB (the Orders). These Orders required improvements to establish an effective compliance risk management programme across HSBCs US businesses, including risk management related to US Bank Secrecy Act (the BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Steps continue to be taken to address the requirements of the Orders. In December 2012, HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC Holdings), HNAH and HSBC Bank USA entered into agreements with US and UK government agencies regarding past inadequate compliance with the BSA, AML and sanctions laws. Among those agreements, HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank USA entered into a five-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DoJ, the US Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the US Attorneys Office for the Northern District of West Virginia (the US DPA); HSBC Holdings entered into a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the New York County District Attorney (the DANY DPA); and HSBC Holdings consented to a cease-and-desist order and HSBC Holdings and HNAH consented to a civil money penalty order with the FRB. In addition, HSBC Bank USA entered into a civil money penalty order with FinCEN and a separate civil money penalty order with the OCC. HSBC Holdings also entered into an agreement with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regarding historical transactions involving parties subject to OFAC sanctions and an undertaking with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA) to comply with certain forward-looking AML and sanctions-related obligations. Under these agreements, HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank USA made payments totalling US$1.9bn to US authorities and are continuing to comply with ongoing obligations. In July 2013, the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York approved the US DPA and retained authority to oversee implementation of that agreement. Under the agreements with the DoJ, FCA, and FRB, an independent monitor (who is, for FCA purposes, a skilled person under Section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act) is evaluating and regularly assessing the effectiveness of HSBCs AML and sanctions compliance function and HSBCs progress in implementing its remedial obligations under the agreements. HSBC Holdings has fulfilled all of the requirements imposed by the DANY DPA, which expired by its terms at the end of the two-year period of that agreement in December 2014. If HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank USA fulfil all of the requirements imposed by the US DPA, the DoJ charges against those entities will be dismissed at the end of the five-year period of that agreement. The DoJ may prosecute HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank USA in relation to any matters that are the subject of the US DPA if HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank USA breaches the terms of the US DPA. HSBC Bank USA also entered into a separate consent order with the OCC, requiring it to correct the circumstances and conditions as noted in the OCCs then most recent report of examination, and imposing certain restrictions on HSBC Bank USA directly or indirectly acquiring control of, or holding an interest in, any new financial subsidiary, or commencing a new activity in its existing financial subsidiary, unless it receives prior approval from the OCC. HSBC Bank USA also entered into a separate consent order with the OCC requiring it to adopt an enterprise-wide compliance programme. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 450 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) These settlements with US and UK authorities have led to private litigation, and do not preclude further private litigation related to HSBCs compliance with applicable BSA, AML and sanctions laws or other regulatory or law enforcement actions for BSA, AML, sanctions or other matters not covered by the various agreements. In May 2014, a shareholder derivative action was filed by a shareholder of HSBC Holdings purportedly on behalf of HSBC Holdings, HSBC Bank USA, HNAH and HSBC USA Inc. (the Nominal Corporate Defendants) in New York State Supreme Court against certain current and former directors and officers of those HSBC companies (the Individual Defendants). The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Nominal Corporate Defendants and caused a waste of corporate assets by allegedly permitting and/or causing the conduct underlying the US DPA. In October 2014, the Nominal Corporate Defendants moved to dismiss the action, and the Individual Defendants who had been served also responded to the complaint. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in February 2015. In July 2014, a claim was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against HSBC Holdings and a former employee purportedly on behalf of a class of persons who purchased HSBC common shares and ADSs between July 2006 and July 2012. The complaint, which seeks monetary damages of up to CA$20bn, alleges that the defendants made statutory and common law misrepresentations in documents released by HSBC Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiary, HSBC Bank Canada, relating to HSBCs compliance with BSA, AML, sanctions and other laws. In November 2014, a complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of representatives of US persons killed or injured in Iraq between April 2004 and November 2011. The complaint was filed against HSBC Holdings, HSBC Bank plc, HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Bank Middle East, as well as other non-HSBC banks and the Islamic Republic of Iran (together, the Defendants). The plaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to violate the US Anti-Terrorism Act, by altering or falsifying payment messages involving Iran, Iranian parties and Iranian banks for transactions processed through the US. Defendants motion to dismiss is due to be filed in March 2015. These private lawsuits are at an early stage. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these private lawsuits, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC. Tax and broker-dealer investigations HSBC continues to cooperate in ongoing investigations by the DoJ and the US Internal Revenue Service regarding whether certain HSBC companies and employees acted appropriately in relation to certain customers who had US tax reporting obligations. In connection with these investigations, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA (HSBC Swiss Private Bank), with due regard for Swiss law, has produced records and other documents to the DoJ. In August 2013, the DoJ informed HSBC Swiss Private Bank that it was not eligible for the Program for Non-Prosecution Agreements or Non-Target Letters for Swiss Banks since a formal investigation had previously been authorised. The DoJ has requested additional information from HSBC Swiss Private Bank and other Swiss banks regarding the transfer of assets to and from US person-related accounts and employees who serviced those accounts. HSBC Swiss Private Bank is preparing this data, in a manner consistent with Swiss law. Other HSBC companies have received subpoenas and requests for information from US and other authorities, including with respect to US-based clients of an HSBC company in India. In November 2014, HSBC Swiss Private Bank reached a final settlement with the SEC relating to cross-border brokerage and advisory services provided by HSBC Swiss Private Bank and its predecessor entities to US resident clients between 2003 and 2011. In addition, various tax administration, regulatory and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in Belgium, France, Argentina, Switzerland and India, are conducting investigations and reviews of HSBC Swiss Private Bank in connection with allegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, money laundering and unlawful cross-border banking solicitation. HSBC Swiss Private Bank has been placed under formal criminal examination by magistrates in both Belgium and France. In February 2015, HSBC was informed that the French magistrates are of the view that they have completed their investigation with respect to HSBC Swiss Private Bank and have referred the matter to the public prosecutor for a recommendation on any potential charges to be brought, whilst reserving the right to continue investigating other conduct at HSBC. In addition, in November 2014, the Argentine tax authority filed a complaint alleging an unlawful association between HSBC Swiss Private Bank, HSBC Bank Argentina, HSBC Bank USA and certain current and former HSBC officers, which allegedly enabled HSBC customers to evade Argentine tax obligations. In February 2015, a public prosecutor in Switzerland commenced an investigation of HSBC Swiss Private Bank, and the Indian tax authority issued a summons and request for information to an HSBC company in India. With respect to each of these ongoing matters, HSBC is cooperating with the relevant authorities. Based on the facts currently known, there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the terms on which they will be resolved and the timing of such resolutions, including the amounts of fines, penalties and/or forfeitures imposed on HSBC, which could be significant. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 451 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) In light of the recent media attention regarding these matters, it is possible that other tax administration, regulatory or law enforcement authorities will also initiate or enlarge similar investigations or regulatory proceedings. London interbank offered rates, European interbank offered rates and other benchmark interest rate investigations and litigation Various regulators and competition and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in the UK, the US, the EU, Switzerland and elsewhere, are conducting investigations and reviews related to certain past submissions made by panel banks and the processes for making submissions in connection with the setting of London interbank offered rates (Libor), European interbank offered rates (Euribor) and other benchmark interest rates. As certain HSBC companies are members of such panels, HSBC has been the subject of regulatory demands for information and is cooperating with those investigations and reviews. In December 2013, the European Commission (the Commission) announced that it had imposed fines on eight financial institutions under its cartel settlement procedure for their participation in illegal activity related to euro interest rate derivatives and/or yen interest rate derivatives. Although HSBC was not one of the financial institutions fined, the Commission announced that it had opened proceedings against HSBC in connection with its Euribor-related investigation of euro interest rate derivatives only. This investigation will continue under the standard Commission cartel procedure. In May 2014, HSBC received a Statement of Objections from the Commission, alleging anti-competitive practices in connection with the pricing of euro interest rate derivatives. The Statement of Objections sets out the Commissions preliminary views and does not prejudge the final outcome of its investigation. HSBC responded partially to the Commissions Statement of Objections in November 2014, and will have the opportunity to complete its response on a date to be decided by the Commission, once various procedural issues are resolved. Based on the facts currently known, with respect to each of these ongoing investigations, there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the terms on which they will be resolved and the timing of such resolution, including the amounts of fines and/or penalties, which could be significant. In addition, HSBC and other US dollar Libor panel banks have been named as defendants in a number of private lawsuits filed in the US with respect to the setting of US dollar Libor. The complaints assert claims under various US laws, including US antitrust and racketeering laws, the US Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), and state law. The lawsuits include individual and putative class actions, most of which have been transferred and/or consolidated for pre-trial purposes before the New York District Court. In March 2013, the New York District Court overseeing the consolidated proceedings related to US dollar Libor issued a decision in the six oldest actions, dismissing the plaintiffs federal and state antitrust claims, racketeering claims, and unjust enrichment claims in their entirety, but allowing certain of their CEA claims that were not barred by the applicable statute of limitations to proceed. Some of those plaintiffs appealed the New York District Courts decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which later dismissed those appeals. In January 2015, the US Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the merits of the plaintiffs appeal. Other plaintiffs sought to file amended complaints in the New York District Court to assert additional allegations. In June 2014, the New York District Court issued a decision that, amongst other things, denied the plaintiffs request for leave to amend their complaints to assert additional theories of Libor manipulation against HSBC and certain non-HSBC banks, but granted leave to assert such manipulation claims against two other banks; and granted defendants motion to dismiss certain additional claims under the CEA as barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Proceedings with respect to all other actions in the consolidated proceedings were stayed pending this decision. The stay was lifted in September 2014. Amended complaints were filed in previously stayed non-class actions in October 2014; and amended complaints were filed in several of the previously stayed class actions in November 2014. Motions to dismiss were filed in November 2014 and January 2015, respectively, and remain pending. Separately, HSBC and other panel banks have also been named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the New York District Court on behalf of persons who transacted in euroyen futures and options contracts related to the euroyen Tokyo interbank offered rate (Tibor). The complaint alleges, amongst other things, misconduct related to euroyen Tibor, although HSBC is not a member of the Japanese Bankers Associations euroyen Tibor panel, as well as Japanese yen Libor, in violation of US antitrust laws, the CEA, and state law. In March 2014, the New York District Court issued an opinion dismissing the plaintiffs claims under US antitrust law and state law, but sustaining their claims under the CEA. In June 2014, the plaintiffs moved for leave to file a third amended complaint. HSBC has opposed that motion, which remains pending. In November 2013, HSBC and other panel banks were also named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the New York District Court on behalf of persons who transacted in euro futures contracts and other financial instruments related to Euribor. The complaint alleges, amongst other things, misconduct related to Euribor in violation of US antitrust laws, the CEA and state law. The plaintiffs filed a second and later third amended complaint in May 2014 and October 2014, respectively. HSBC intends to respond to the third amended complaint once a court-ordered stay expires, currently set for May 2015. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 452 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) In September and October 2014, HSBC Bank plc and other panel banks were named as defendants in a number of putative class actions that were filed and consolidated in the New York District Court on behalf of persons who transacted in interest rate derivative transactions or purchased or sold financial instruments that were either tied to USD ISDAfix rates or were executed shortly before, during, or after the time of the daily ISDAfix setting window. The complaint alleges, amongst other things, misconduct related to these activities in violation of US antitrust laws, the CEA and state law. In October 2014, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. A motion to dismiss that complaint was filed in December 2014 and remains pending. In February 2015, plaintiffs filed a second consolidated amended complaint replacing HSBC Bank plc with HSBC Bank USA. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these private lawsuits, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC. Foreign exchange rate investigations and litigation Various regulators and competition and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in the UK, the US, the EU and elsewhere, are conducting investigations and reviews into a number of firms, including HSBC, related to trading on the foreign exchange markets. In November 2014, HSBC Bank plc entered into regulatory settlements with the FCA and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in connection with their respective investigations of HSBCs trading and other conduct involving foreign exchange benchmark rates. Under the terms of those settlements, HSBC Bank plc agreed to pay a financial penalty of £216m (US$336m) to the FCA and a civil monetary penalty of US$275m to the CFTC, and to undertake various remedial actions. In December 2014, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the completion of its investigation into the foreign exchange trading operations of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HBAP). The investigation found no evidence of market manipulation by HBAP and no monetary penalty was imposed. HBAP was required to implement various remedial actions. The remaining investigations and reviews in the UK, the US and elsewhere are ongoing. Based on the facts currently known there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the terms on which they will be resolved and the timing of such resolutions, including the amounts of fines and/or penalties, which could be significant. As at 31 December 2014, HSBC has recognised a provision in the amount of US$550m in respect of these matters. In addition, in late 2013 and early 2014, HSBC Holdings, HSBC Bank plc, HNAH and HSBC Bank USA were named as defendants, amongst other banks, in various putative class actions filed in the New York District Court. In March 2014, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging, amongst other things, that defendants conspired to manipulate the WM/ Reuters foreign exchange benchmark rates by sharing customers confidential order flow information, thereby injuring plaintiffs and others by forcing them to pay artificial and non-competitive prices for products based on these foreign currency rates (the Consolidated Action). Separate putative class actions were also brought on behalf of non-US plaintiffs (the Foreign Actions). Defendants moved to dismiss all actions. In January 2015, the court denied defendants motion to dismiss as to the Consolidated Action, but granted defendants motion to dismiss as to the Foreign Actions. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these private lawsuits, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC. Precious metals fix-related litigation and investigations Since March 2014, numerous putative class actions have been filed in the US District Courts for the Southern District of New York, the District of New Jersey and the Northern District of California naming HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Bank plc, HSI and other members of The London Gold Market Fixing Limited as defendants. The complaints allege that, from January 2004 to the present, defendants conspired to manipulate the price of gold and gold derivatives during the afternoon London gold fix in order to reap profits on proprietary trades. These actions have been assigned to and consolidated in the New York District Court. An amended consolidated class action complaint was filed in December 2014, and HSBCs response was filed in February 2015. Since July 2014, putative class actions were filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and the Eastern District of New York naming HSBC Holdings, HNAH, HSBC Bank USA, HSBC USA Inc. and other members of The London Silver Market Fixing Ltd as defendants. The complaints allege that, from January 2007 to the present, defendants conspired to manipulate the price of physical silver and silver derivatives for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws and the CEA. These actions have been assigned to and consolidated in the New York District Court. An amended consolidated class action complaint was filed in January 2015, and HSBCs response is due in March 2015. Between late 2014 and early 2015, numerous putative class actions were filed in the New York District Court naming HSBC Bank USA and other members of The London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Company Limited as defendants. The complaints allege that, from January 2007 to the present, defendants conspired to manipulate the price of physical Platinum Group Metals (PGM) and PGM-based financial products for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws and the CEA. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 453 Table of Contents Notes on the Financial Statements (continued) In November 2014, the DoJ issued a document request to HSBC Holdings, seeking the voluntary production of certain documents relating to a criminal antitrust investigation that the DoJ is conducting in relation to precious metals. In January 2015, the CFTC issued a subpoena to HSBC Bank USA, seeking the production of certain documents related to HSBC Bank USAs precious metals trading operations. HSBC is cooperating with the US authorities in their respective investigations. These matters are at an early stage. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC. Credit default swap regulatory investigation and litigation In July 2013, HSBC received a Statement of Objections from the Commission relating to its ongoing investigation of alleged anti-competitive activity by a number of market participants in the credit derivatives market between 2006 and 2009. The Statement of Objections sets out the Commissions preliminary views and does not prejudge the final outcome of its investigation. HSBC has submitted a response and attended an oral hearing in May 2014. Following the oral hearing, the Commission decided to conduct a further investigation phase before deciding whether or how to proceed with the case. HSBC is cooperating with this further investigation. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of this matter, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC. In addition, HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank plc have been named as defendants, amongst others, in numerous putative class actions filed in the New York District Court and the Illinois District Court. These class actions allege that the defendants, which include ISDA, Markit and several other financial institutions, conspired to restrain trade in violation of US antitrust laws by, amongst other things, restricting access to credit default swap pricing exchanges and blocking new entrants into the exchange market, with the purpose and effect of artificially inflating the bid/ask spread paid to buy and sell credit default swaps in the US. The plaintiffs in these suits purport to represent a class of all persons who purchased credit default swaps from or sold credit default swaps to defendants primarily in the US. In October 2013, these cases were consolidated in the New York District Court. An amended consolidated complaint was filed in January 2014, naming HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Bank plc as defendants, amongst other non-HSBC defendants. Following the filing of defendants initial motions to dismiss in March 2014, plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint, which defendants also moved to dismiss. In September 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion to dismiss. Discovery is in process. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these private lawsuits, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC. Economic plans: HSBC Bank Brasil S.A. In the mid-1980s and early 1990s, certain economic plans were introduced by the government of Brazil to reduce escalating inflation. The implementation of these plans adversely impacted savings account holders, thousands of which consequently commenced legal proceedings against financial institutions in Brazil, including HSBC Bank Brasil S.A. (HSBC Brazil), alleging, amongst other things, that savings account balances were adjusted by a different price index than that contractually agreed, which caused them a loss of income. Certain of these cases have reached the Brazilian Supreme Court (the Supreme Court). The Supreme Court has suspended all cases pending before lower courts until it delivers a final judgement on the constitutionality of the changes resulting from the economic plans. It is anticipated that the outcome of the Supreme Courts final judgement will set a precedent for all cases pending before the lower courts. Separately, the Brazilian Superior Civil Court (the Superior Civil Court) is considering matters relating to, amongst other things, contractual and punitive interest rates to be applied to calculate any loss of income. There is a high degree of uncertainty as to the terms on which the proceedings in the Supreme Court and Superior Civil Court will be resolved and the timing of such resolutions, including the amount of losses that HSBC Brazil may be liable to pay in the event of an unfavourable judgement. Such losses may lie in a range from a relatively insignificant amount to an amount up to US$800m, although the upper end of this range is considered unlikely. Regulatory Review of Consumer Enhancement Services Products HSBC Finance, through its legacy Cards and Retail Services business, offered or participated in the marketing, distribution, or servicing of products, such as identity theft protection and credit monitoring products, that were ancillary to the provision of credit to the consumer. HSBC Finance ceased offering these products by May 2012. The offering and administration of these and other enhancement services products, such as debt protection products, has been the subject of enforcement actions against other institutions by regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Such enforcement actions have resulted in orders to pay restitution to customers and the assessment of penalties in substantial amounts. We have made restitution to certain customers in connection with certain enhancement services products, and we continue to cooperate with our regulators in connection with their on-going review. In light of the actions that regulators have taken in relation to other non-HSBC credit card issuers regarding their enhancement services products, one or more regulators may order us to pay additional restitution to customers and/or impose civil money penalties or other relief arising from the prior offering and administration of such enhancement services products by HSBC Finance. There is a high degree of uncertainty as to the terms on which this matter will be resolved and the timing of such resolution, including the amount of any additional remediation which may lie in a range from zero to an amount up to US$500m.

The above outstanding balances arose from the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and security, as for comparable transactions with third-party counterparties. Post-employment benefit plans At 31 December 2014, US$4.5bn (2013: US$5.2bn) of HSBC post-employment benefit plan assets were under management by HSBC companies. Fees of US$12m (2013: US$23m) were earned by HSBC companies for these management services provided to its post-employment benefit plans. HSBCs post-employment benefit plans had placed deposits of US$223m (2013: US$620m) with its banking subsidiaries, on which interest payable to the schemes amounted to US$6m (2013: US$1m). The above outstanding balances arose from the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and security, as for comparable transactions with third-party counterparties. HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme entered into swap transactions with HSBC as part of the management of the inflation and interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. At 31 December 2014, the gross notional value of the swaps was US$24bn (2013: US$38bn), the swaps had a positive fair value of US$0.9bn (2013: positive fair value of US$2.8bn) to the scheme and HSBC had delivered collateral of US$2.0bn (2013: US$3.8bn) to the scheme in respect of these swaps, on which HSBC earned US$5m of interest (2013: US$33m). All swaps were executed at prevailing market rates and within standard market bid/offer spreads. Over the year, the Scheme reduced its level of swap transactions with HSBC. The International Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme entered into swap transactions with HSBC to manage the inflation and interest rate sensitivity of the liabilities and selected assets. At 31 December 2014, the gross notional value of the swaps was US$1.9bn (2013: US$1.8bn) and the swaps had a net negative fair value of US$107m to the scheme (2013: US$399m positive). All swaps were executed at prevailing market rates and within standard market bid/offer spreads.

Interim dividends for 2015 The Board has adopted a policy of paying quarterly interim dividends on the ordinary shares. Under this policy it is intended to have a pattern of three equal interim dividends with a variable fourth interim dividend. It is envisaged that the first interim dividend in respect of 2015 will be US$0.10 per ordinary share. Dividends are declared in US dollars and, at the election of the shareholder, paid in cash in one of, or in a combination of, US dollars, sterling and Hong Kong dollars, or, subject to the Boards determination that a scrip dividend is to be offered in respect of that dividend, may be satisfied in whole or in part by the issue of new shares in lieu of a cash dividend.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 461 Table of Contents Shareholder Information (continued) Simplified Structure Chart of HSBC Holdings plc  This simplified Group structure of principal subsidiaries is at 31 December 2014.  Not all intermediate holding companies are shown.  Unless shown otherwise, all subsidiaries are wholly owned. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 462 Table of Contents Shareholder Information (continued) Taxation of shares and dividends Taxation  UK residents The following is a summary, under current law, of certain UK tax considerations that are likely to be material to the ownership and disposition of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of shares. In particular, the summary deals principally with shareholders who are resident solely in the UK for UK tax purposes and only with holders who hold the shares as investments and who are the beneficial owners of the shares, and does not address the tax treatment of certain classes of holders such as dealers in securities. Holders and prospective purchasers should consult their own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in shares in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any national, state or local laws. Taxation of dividends Currently no tax is withheld from dividends paid by HSBC Holdings. However, dividends are paid with an associated tax credit which is available for set-off by certain shareholders against any liability they may have to UK income tax. Currently, the associated tax credit is equivalent to 10% of the combined cash dividend and tax credit, i.e. one-ninth of the cash dividend. For individual shareholders who are resident in the UK for taxation purposes and liable to UK income tax at the basic rate, no further UK income tax liability arises on the receipt of a dividend from HSBC Holdings. Individual shareholders who are liable to UK income tax at the higher rate or additional rate are taxed on the combined amount of the dividend and the tax credit at the dividend upper rate (currently 32.5%) and the dividend additional rate (currently 37.5%), respectively. The tax credit is available for set-off against the dividend upper rate and the dividend additional rate liability. Individual UK resident shareholders are not entitled to any tax credit repayment. Although non-UK resident shareholders are generally not entitled to any repayment of the tax credit in respect of any UK dividend received, some such shareholders may be so entitled under the provisions of a double taxation agreement between their country of residence and the UK. However, in most cases no amount of the tax credit is, in practice, repayable. Information on the taxation consequences of the HSBC Holdings scrip dividends offered in lieu of the 2013 fourth interim dividend and the first, second and third interim dividends for 2014 was set out in the Secretarys letters to shareholders of 25 March, 5 June, 3 September and 5 November 2014. In no case was the difference between the cash dividend foregone and the market value of the scrip dividend in excess of 15% of the market value. Accordingly, the amount of the dividend income chargeable to tax, and, the acquisition price of the HSBC Holdings ordinary shares for UK capital gains tax purposes, was the cash dividend foregone. Taxation of capital gains The computation of the capital gains tax liability arising on disposals of shares in HSBC Holdings by shareholders subject to UK tax on capital gains can be complex, partly depending on whether, for example, the shares were purchased since April 1991, acquired in 1991 in exchange for shares in The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, or acquired subsequent to 1991 in exchange for shares in other companies. For capital gains tax purposes, the acquisition cost for ordinary shares is adjusted to take account of subsequent rights and capitalisation issues. Any capital gain arising on a disposal by a UK company may also be adjusted to take account of indexation allowance. If in doubt, shareholders are recommended to consult their professional advisers. Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax Transfers of shares by a written instrument of transfer generally will be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer, and such stamp duty is generally payable by the transferee. An agreement to transfer shares, or any interest therein, normally will give rise to a charge to stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration. However, provided an instrument of transfer of the shares is executed pursuant to the agreement and duly stamped before the date on which the stamp duty reserve tax becomes payable, under the current practice of UK HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) it will not be necessary to pay the stamp duty reserve tax, nor to apply for such tax to be cancelled. Stamp duty reserve tax is generally payable by the transferee. Paperless transfers of shares within CREST, the UKs paperless share transfer system, are liable to stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration. In CREST transactions, the tax is calculated and payment made automatically. Deposits of shares into CREST generally will not be subject to stamp duty reserve tax, unless the transfer into CREST is itself for consideration. Following the case HSBC pursued before the European Court of Justice (Case C-569/07 HSBC Holdings plc and Vidacos Nominees Ltd v The Commissioners for HM Revenue & Customs) and a subsequent case in relation to depositary receipts, HMRC now accepts that the charge to stamp duty reserve tax at 1.5% on the issue of shares to a depositary receipt issuer or a clearance service is prohibited. Taxation  US residents The following is a summary, under current law, of the principal UK tax and US federal income tax considerations that are likely to be material to the ownership and disposition of shares or American HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 463 Table of Contents Shareholder Information (continued) Depositary Shares (ADSs) by a holder that is a resident of the US for US federal income tax purposes (a US holder) and who is not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of shares or ADSs. In particular, the summary deals only with US holders that hold shares or ADSs as capital assets, and does not address the tax treatment of holders that are subject to special tax rules, such as banks, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that hold shares or ADSs as part of an integrated investment (including a straddle) comprised of a share or ADS and one or more other positions, and persons that own, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of HSBC Holdings. This discussion is based on laws, treaties, judicial decisions and regulatory interpretations in effect on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change. Holders and prospective purchasers should consult their own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in shares or ADSs in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any national, state or local laws. Any US federal tax advice included in this Annual Report and Accounts is for informational purposes only; it was not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of avoiding US federal tax penalties. Taxation of dividends Currently no tax is withheld from dividends paid by HSBC Holdings. For US tax purposes, a US holder must include cash dividends paid on the shares or ADSs in ordinary income on the date that such holder or the ADS depositary receives them, translating dividends paid in UK pounds sterling into US dollars using the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt. A US holder that elects to receive shares in lieu of a cash dividend must include in ordinary income the fair market value of such shares on the dividend payment date, and the tax basis of those shares will equal such fair market value. Subject to certain exceptions for positions that are held for less than 61 days or are hedged, and subject to a foreign corporation being considered a qualified foreign corporation (which includes not being classified for US federal income tax purposes as a passive foreign investment company), certain dividends (qualified dividends) received by an individual US holder generally will be subject to US taxation at preferential rates. Based on the companys audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, HSBC Holdings does not anticipate being classified as a passive foreign investment company. Accordingly, dividends paid on the shares or ADSs generally should be treated as qualified dividends. Taxation of capital gains Gains realised by a US holder on the sale or other disposition of shares or ADSs normally will not be subject to UK taxation unless at the time of the sale or other disposition the holder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency or permanent establishment and the shares or ADSs are or have been used, held or acquired for the purposes of such trade, profession, vocation, branch or agency or permanent establishment. Such gains will be included in income for US tax purposes, and will be long-term capital gains if the shares or ADSs were held for more than one year. A long-term capital gain realised by an individual US holder generally will be subject to US tax at preferential rates. Inheritance tax Shares or ADSs held by an individual whose domicile is determined to be the US for the purposes of the United States-United Kingdom Double Taxation Convention relating to estate and gift taxes (the Estate Tax Treaty) and who is not for such purposes a national of the UK will not, provided any US federal estate or gift tax chargeable has been paid, be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individuals death or on a lifetime transfer of shares or ADSs except in certain cases where the shares or ADSs (i) are comprised in a settlement (unless, at the time of the settlement, the settlor was domiciled in the US and was not a national of the UK), (ii) is part of the business property of a UK permanent establishment of an enterprise, or (iii) pertains to a UK fixed base of an individual used for the performance of independent personal services. In such cases, the Estate Tax Treaty generally provides a credit against US federal tax liability for the amount of any tax paid in the UK in a case where the shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to US federal estate or gift tax. Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax  ADSs If shares are transferred to a clearance service or American Depositary Receipt (ADR) issuer (which will include a transfer of shares to the Depositary) under the current HMRC practice UK stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable. The stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is generally payable on the consideration for the transfer and is payable at the aggregate rate of 1.5%. The amount of stamp duty reserve tax payable on such a transfer will be reduced by any stamp duty paid in connection with the same transfer. No stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS, provided that the ADR and any separate instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remain at all times outside the UK, and provided further that any such transfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the UK. No stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on a transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS effected by the transfer of an ADR. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 464 Table of Contents Shareholder Information (continued) US backup withholding tax and information reporting Distributions made on shares or ADSs and proceeds from the sale of shares or ADSs that are paid within the US, or through certain financial intermediaries to US holders, are subject to information reporting and may be subject to a US backup withholding tax unless, in general, the US holder complies with certain certification procedures or is a corporation or other person exempt from such withholding. Holders that are not US persons generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding tax, but may be required to comply with applicable certification procedures to establish that they are not US persons in order to avoid the application of such information reporting requirements or backup withholding tax to payments received within the US or through certain financial intermediaries. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 465 Table of Contents Shareholder Information (continued) Information about the enforceability of judgements made in the US HSBC Holdings is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales. Most of the Directors and executive officers live outside the US. As a result, it may not be possible to serve process on such persons or HSBC Holdings in the US or to enforce judgements obtained in US courts against them or HSBC Holdings based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the US. There is doubt as to whether English courts would enforce:  civil liabilities under US securities laws in original actions; or  judgements of US courts based upon these civil liability provisions. In addition, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the US or elsewhere may be unenforceable in the UK. The enforceability of any judgement in the UK will depend on the particular facts of the case as well as the laws and treaties in effect at the time. Exchange controls and other limitations affecting equity security holders Other than certain economic sanctions which may be in force from time to time, there are currently no UK laws, decrees or regulations which would prevent the import or export of capital or remittance of distributable profits by way of dividends and other payments to holders of HSBC Holdings equity securities who are not residents of the UK.

Memorandum and Articles of Association The disclosure under the caption Memorandum and Articles of Association contained in Form 20-F for the years ended 31 December 2000 and 2001 is incorporated by reference herein, together with the disclosure below. Directors interests Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and provided that the Articles are complied with, a Director, notwithstanding his office:  may enter into or otherwise be interested in any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal with HSBC Holdings or in which HSBC Holdings is otherwise interested;  may hold any other office or place of profit under HSBC Holdings (except that of auditor or auditor of a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings) in conjunction with the office of Director and may act by himself or through his firm in a professional capacity for HSBC Holdings, and in any such case on such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Board may arrange;  may be a director or other officer, or employed by, or a party to any transaction or arrangement with or otherwise interested in, any company promoted by HSBC Holdings or in which HSBC Holdings is otherwise interested or as regards which HSBC Holdings has any powers of appointment; and  shall not be liable to account to HSBC Holdings for any profit, remuneration or other benefit realised by any such office, employment, contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal or from any interest in any body corporate and no such contract, arrangement, transaction, proposal or interest shall be avoided on the grounds of any such interest or benefit nor shall the receipt of any such profit, remuneration or any other benefit constitute a breach of his or her duty under the Companies Act 2006 not to accept benefits from third parties. Since 1 October 2008, the Board may authorise any matter proposed to it which would, if not so authorised, involve a breach by a Director of his or her duty to avoid conflicts of interest under the Companies Act 2006, including, without limitation, any matter which relates to a situation in which a Director has, or can have, an interest which conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interest of HSBC Holdings (including the exploitation of any property, information or opportunity, whether or not HSBC Holdings could take advantage of it, but excluding any situation which cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest). Any such authorisation will be effective only if:  any requirement as to quorum at the meeting at which the matter is considered is met without counting the Director in question or any other interested Director; and  the matter was agreed to without their voting or would have been agreed to if their votes had not been counted. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 465c Table of Contents Shareholder Information (continued) The Board may (whether at the time of the giving of the authorisation or subsequently) make any such authorisation subject to any limits or conditions it expressly imposes but such authorisation is otherwise given to the fullest extent permitted. The Board may vary or terminate any such authorisation at any time. A Director shall be under no duty to HSBC Holdings with respect to any information which he obtains or has obtained otherwise than as a Director of HSBC Holdings and in respect of which he has a duty of confidentiality to another person. Retirement There is no mandatory retirement age for Directors of HSBC Holdings. History and development of HSBC 1865 The founding member of the HSBC Group, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, is established in both Hong Kong and Shanghai. 1959 The Mercantile Bank of India Limited and The British Bank of the Middle East, now HSBC Bank Middle East Limited, are purchased. 1965 We acquire a 51% interest (subsequently increased to 62.14%) in Hang Seng Bank Limited.

Differences in HSBC Holdings/New York Stock Exchange corporate governance practices Under the NYSEs corporate governance rules for listed companies and the applicable rules of the SEC, as a NYSE-listed foreign private issuer, HSBC Holdings must disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US companies subject to NYSE listing standards. HSBC Holdings believes the following to be the significant differences between its corporate governance practices and NYSE corporate governance rules applicable to US companies. US companies listed on the NYSE are required to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. The Listing Rules of the FCA require each listed company incorporated in the UK to include in its Annual Report HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 465d Table of Contents Shareholder Information (continued) and Accounts a statement of how it has applied the principles of The UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council and a statement as to whether or not it has complied with the code provisions of The UK Corporate Governance Code throughout the accounting period covered by the Annual Report and Accounts. A company that has not complied with the code provisions, or complied with only some of the code provisions or (in the case of provisions whose requirements are of a continuing nature) complied for only part of an accounting period covered by the report, must specify the code provisions with which it has not complied, and (where relevant) for what part of the reporting period such non-compliance continued, and give reasons for any non-compliance. As stated above, HSBC Holdings complied throughout 2014 with the applicable code provisions of The UK Corporate Governance Code. The UK Corporate Governance Code does not require HSBC Holdings to disclose the full range of corporate governance guidelines with which it complies. Under NYSE standards, companies are required to have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of directors determined to be independent in accordance with the NYSEs corporate governance rules. All of the members of the Nomination Committee during 2014 were independent non-executive Directors, as determined in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The terms of reference of our Nomination Committee, which comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code, require a majority of members to be independent. In addition to identifying individuals qualified to become Board members, a nominating/corporate governance committee must develop and recommend to the Board a set of corporate governance principles. The Nomination Committees terms of reference do not require it to develop and recommend corporate governance principles for HSBC Holdings. As stated above, HSBC Holdings is subject to the corporate governance principles of The UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board of Directors is responsible under its terms of reference for the development and review of Group policies and practices on corporate governance. Under the NYSE standards, companies are required to have a compensation committee composed entirely of directors determined to be independent in accordance with the NYSEs corporate governance rules. All of the members of the Group Remuneration Committee during 2014 were independent non-executive Directors, as determined in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The terms of reference of our Group Remuneration Committee, which comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code, require at least three members to be independent. A compensation committee must review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to chief executive officer compensation and evaluate a chief executive officers performance in light of these goals and objectives. The Group Remuneration Committees terms of reference require it to review and approve performance-based remuneration of the executive Directors by reference to corporate goals and objectives which are set by the Board of Directors. Pursuant to NYSE listing standards, non-management directors must meet on a regular basis without management present and independent directors must meet separately at least once per year. During 2014, the non-executive Directors and the Group Chairman met once without the other executive Directors. The non-executive Directors also met four times without the Group Chairman, including to appraise the Group Chairmans performance. HSBC Holdings practice, in this regard, complies with The UK Corporate Governance Code. In accordance with the requirements of The UK Corporate Governance Code, HSBC Holdings discloses in its Annual Report and Accounts how the Board, its committees and the Directors are evaluated (on pages 273 to 274) and provides extensive information regarding Directors compensation in the Directors Remuneration Report (on pages 300 to 327). The terms of reference of HSBC Holdings Group Audit, Group Nomination, Group Remuneration and Group Risk Committees are available at www.hsbc.com/investor-relations/governance/boardcommittees. NYSE listing standards require US companies to adopt a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees, and promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers. In 2009, the Board endorsed three HSBC Values statements underpinned by the continued use of our Business Principles, in replacement of the Group Business Principles and Values. In addition to the HSBC Values statements and Business Principles (and previously the Group Business Principles and Values), which apply to the employees of all our companies, pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act the Board of HSBC Holdings has adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive, as the principal executive officers, and to the Group Finance Director and Group Chief Accounting Officer. HSBC Holdings Code of Ethics is available on www.hsbc.com/codeofethics or from the Group Company Secretary at 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ. If the Board amends or waives the provisions of the Code of Ethics, details of the amendment or waiver will appear at the same website address. During 2014, HSBC Holdings made no amendments to its Code of Ethics and granted no waivers from its provisions. The references to the standards to be followed by all employees reflect the Boards endorsement of HSBC Values statements underpinned by the continued use of our Business Principles. The HSBC Values statements and Business Principles are available on www.hsbc.com/groupvalues. Under NYSE listing rules applicable to US companies, independent directors must comprise a majority of the board of directors. Currently, more than three-quarters of HSBC Holdings Directors are independent. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 465e Table of Contents Shareholder Information (continued) Under The UK Corporate Governance Code the HSBC Holdings Board determines whether a Director is independent in character and judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the Directors judgement. Under the NYSE rules a director cannot qualify as independent unless the board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the listed company; in addition the NYSE rules prescribe a list of circumstances in which a director cannot be independent. The UK Corporate Governance Code requires a companys board to assess director independence by affirmatively concluding that the director is independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of independent judgement. Lastly, a chief executive officer of a US company listed on the NYSE must annually certify that he or she is not aware of any violation by the company of NYSE corporate governance standards. In accordance with NYSE listing rules applicable to foreign private issuers, HSBC Holdings Group Chief Executive is not required to provide the NYSE with this annual compliance certification. However, in accordance with rules applicable to both US companies and foreign private issuers, the Group Chief Executive is required promptly to notify the NYSE in writing after any executive officer becomes aware of any material non-compliance with the NYSE corporate governance standards applicable to HSBC Holdings. HSBC Holdings is required to submit annual and interim written affirmations of compliance with applicable NYSE corporate governance standards, similar to the affirmations required of NYSE-listed US companies.
