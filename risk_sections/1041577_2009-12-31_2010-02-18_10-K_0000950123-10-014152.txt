Item 1A. Risk Factors Cautionary Statements Regarding Future Results of Operations You should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings. These cautionary statements are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ATMI with broad international operations. Like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the United States or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our common stock is subject to volatility because of fluctuations in general market conditions, differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community, and other factors beyond our control. The global economic recession and continuing uncertainty in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business may be affected by the ongoing volatility and illiquidity in the financial and credit markets, the general global economic recession, such as inflationary or deflationary pressures and other market or economic challenges experienced by the world economy. There can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. The recent tightening of credit in financial markets and the general economic downturn has led consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which has caused our customers to delay orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of these disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions, and if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Cyclicality in the markets we sell to may adversely affect our performance. The semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases or decreases in demand. These changes, along with cyclical changes in the flat-panel display market, could adversely affect our results of operations and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Our results of operations have been adversely affected, and may be further affected in the future, if demand for semiconductors, or devices that use semiconductors, or flat panels decreases or grows at a significantly slower pace than has historically occurred. Subsequent upturns in the markets which we serve have historically been characterized by sudden increased product demand and production capacity constraints. We may have difficulty reacting quickly enough to a sudden upturn in demand for our products and may incur significant expediting and manufacturing costs to meet a rapid increase in customer demand. Our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors. Our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of, our inventory and shifts in our product mix. Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are fixed in the short term. Accordingly, reduced demand for our products and services can cause our fixed production costs to be allocated across reduced production volumes, which can adversely affect our gross margin and profitability, and reduced demand could adversely affect our performance. Our ability to reduce expenses is further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing global customer base. 15 Table of Contents Our business could be adversely affected if we cannot protect our proprietary technology or if we infringe on the proprietary technology of others. Our proprietary technology aids our ability to compete effectively with other companies. Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for or have been licensed under numerous patents in the United States and other countries, these patents may not fully protect our technology or competitive position. Further, our competitors may apply for and obtain patents that will restrict our ability to make and sell our products. Our competitors may intentionally infringe our patents. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against us in the future. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. The defense and prosecution of patent suits are both costly and time-consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. Outside the United States, in particular, such proceedings can be extremely expensive and their outcome very unpredictable. An adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could cause us to lose proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to license rights from third parties or to cease selling our products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology that others may independently develop or otherwise obtain access to. Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies could negatively affect our revenues and earnings. The loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. While we generate revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations. Our customers and their customers aggressive management of inventory has already adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to adversely affect future results of operations. Customer driven pricing pressure may adversely affect our average selling prices. We face aggressive cost-containment pressures from our customers. There can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain current prices in the face of continuing pricing pressures. Over time, the average price for our products may decline as the markets for these products become more competitive. Any material reduction in product prices could negatively affect both revenues and profits. Our revenues and earnings could be negatively affected if we cannot anticipate market trends, enhance our existing products and processes, develop and commercialize new products and processes, and identify and consummate strategic acquisitions. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends, to enhance our existing products and processes, to develop and commercialize new products and processes, and to expand through selected acquisitions of technologies or businesses or other strategic alliances. The microelectronics industry markets we serve undergo frequent technological changes, which in turn create demand for new and improved products and process technologies. We may not be able to improve our existing products and process technologies or to develop and market new products and technologies that will be cost-effective or introduced in a timely manner or accepted in the marketplace. We may not be able to leverage our knowledge to make full use of combinatorial science and HPD capabilities into as an effective market offering for our customers. Our failure to develop or introduce enhanced and new products and processes in a timely manner may negatively affect our revenues and earnings, and result in a potential impairment of assets. Management considers, on a continuing basis, potential acquisitions of technologies and businesses and other strategic alliances, some of which may be material to us. However, we cannot be assured that we will identify or succeed in consummating transactions with suitable acquisition candidates or alliance partners in the future. 16 Table of Contents We may have difficulty obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing or assembling our products or operating other aspects of our business, which could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs. We have hundreds of suppliers providing various materials that we use in the production of our products and other aspects of our business, and we seek, where possible, to have several sources of supply for all of these materials. However, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country, for certain of these materials. The inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production process. In addition, production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as electricity, chemicals, and gases. The unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of these materials or resources. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We face intense competition from a variety of sources, including larger companies. The markets for our products are intensely competitive. A number of domestic and international companies engage in commercial activities in the markets we serve. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. In addition, as this industry evolves, other competitors may emerge. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in and focus upon research and development and product and process innovation. We may not be successful if we cannot compete on: price, technical capabilities, quality, or customer service. Our global manufacturing and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal, political, economic or other changes. We have facilities in eight countries worldwide and, in 2009, more than 80 percent of our revenues came from sales to companies outside the United States. Operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as the general political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks, of the various countries in which we operate, which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchanges rates. Given our current operations and large customer base outside the United States, we employ the use of forward currency exchange contracts to attempt to minimize the potentially adverse earnings effect from exchange rate fluctuations on our net balance sheet exposures. Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, such as the Euro, Japanese Yen, and the South Korean Won, fluctuations can have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by natural events in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate. We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes that could disrupt operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or our customers or suppliers operations, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered may affect our ability to meet our forecasts, especially during the current economic crisis where there is limited visibility to future wafer starts. In addition, when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customers demands. These forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. If we inaccurately forecast customer demand, or if the industry recovers more quickly than anticipated, we may incur expedited shipping costs to deliver products to meet customer demand or hold excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our results of operations. 17 Table of Contents We may have difficulty managing our growth and attracting and retaining highly skilled scientific, technical, managerial and marketing personnel, which could adversely affect our revenues and increase our operating expenses. Despite the recent economic downturn and contraction of our business, we have historically experienced periods of growth and intend to grow our business in the future. The management of our growth requires qualified personnel, systems and other resources. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific, technical, managerial and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel in the industries that we serve is intense, and our competitors are often larger and more established than we are. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. In addition, our expansion may also significantly strain operational, management, financial, sales and marketing and other resources. To manage growth effectively, we must continue to enhance and integrate our information technology infrastructure, systems and controls and successfully expand, train and manage our employee base. We may not be able to manage this expansion effectively, including by providing satisfactory levels of customer service and technical support. Inability to manage our growth and to attract and retain skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We engage in acquisitions, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. We seek to grow through strategic acquisitions. In the past several years, we have made certain acquisitions intended to complement and expand our business, and may continue to do so in the future. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions, apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, and cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We face the risk of product liability claims. The manufacture and sale of our products, which include thin film and other toxic materials, involve the risk of product liability claims. In addition, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of the customer. Our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us. Our business is potentially subject to substantial liabilities for failure to comply with environmental regulations. We use, generate and discharge toxic or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our manufacturing, processing and research and development activities. As a result, we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the storage, use and disposal of these materials. Our failure to comply with present or future laws could result in fines or other liabilities being imposed on us, suspension of production or a cessation of operations. In addition, under federal and state statutes and regulations, a government agency may seek to recover its response costs and/or require future remedial measures from both operators and owners of property where releases of hazardous substances may have occurred (including releases by prior occupants) or are ongoing, and for which only partial indemnification may be available in some cases. Our activities may also result in our being subject to additional regulation. Such regulations could require us to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur other substantial expenses to comply with environmental laws. Our failure to control the use of hazardous substances could subject us to substantial financial liabilities. 18 Table of Contents Our financial results or financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, inventories, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in taxation. We have facilities in eight countries and, as a result, are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the appropriate jurisdiction to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. Changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability may change. Compliance with changing corporate governance regulations and public disclosures may result in additional risks and exposures. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new regulations from the SEC, have created uncertainty for public companies such as ours. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices and our commitment to maintaining high standards with regard thereto. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased selling, general, and administrative expenses and significant management time and attention. In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment and, our independent registered public accounting firms audit, for fiscal 2009 have necessitated, and we expect such efforts to continue to necessitate, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources.
