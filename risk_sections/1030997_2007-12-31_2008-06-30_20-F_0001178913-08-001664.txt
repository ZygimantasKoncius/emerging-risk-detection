D. RISK FACTORS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE IMPACTED BY MONETARY RISK. OUR PORTFOLIO OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS MARKET RISKS. We are exposed to fluctuations in the rate of the United States Dollar and Euro versus the NIS. Most of our income is in NIS, whereas most of our purchases are in United States Dollars and in Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our short term bank borrowings, when needed, are in United States Dollars and/or in Euros. A significant depreciation in the NIS vis-a-vis the United States Dollar and/or Euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We strive to minimize market risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations and the cost of imported goods, especially by opening wide documentary credits for suppliers abroad, holding foreign currency reserves and initiating forward transactions and foreign currency options. As a method of investing cash reserves, we hold from time to time a portfolio of marketable securities traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange as well as other stock exchanges and certain bonds traded abroad. This portfolio of marketable securities is subject to various market risks resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency, exchange rates, price fluctuations and other market risks in Israel and abroad. We do not utilize derivative securities for trading purposes, enter into swap arrangements or otherwise hedge our currency in a manner that we believe could expose us to significant market risk. Page 4 Our financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, current accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable and accruals. In view of their nature, the fair value of the financial instruments, included in working capital, is usually identical or close to their book value. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED IF ANY OF OUR MAJOR CLIENTS DEFAULTS ON ITS PAYMENT TO US. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. Despite our large number of clients (over 1,100 in Israel and about 900 abroad), a major and significant part of our sales is made to a limited number of customers (mainly the organized market). Our two largest customers accounted for 21% of our sales in 2007. We generally do not require and do not receive collateral from those customers, although we do require and receive collateral from most of the remainder of our clients in Israel to ensure security of collecting payments. We maintain an allowance for doubtful debts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information which our management believes adequately covers all anticipated losses in respect of trade receivables. There can be no assurance that this allowance will be adequate. In the event that any of our major clients defaults on its payment obligations to us, such as Club Market in 2005, we will not possess sufficient security to collect the entire debt. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. We depend on a small number of technical staff, managers and directors, including managing services provided to us by Zwi Williger and Joseph Williger, through management companies that they control, each of whom holds senior management positions with us. The loss of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AND OTHER POLICIES OF THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES INTO WHICH WE IMPORT AND EXPORT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY QUALIFICATIONS OR APPROVALS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. REGULATORY, LICENSING AND QUOTAS: The import, export, storage, marketing, distribution and labeling of food products are subject to extensive regulation and licensing by various Israeli government and municipal agencies, principally the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Finance. To the extent that we have imported and exported, or will import and export, food products outside of Israel, we may be subject to quotas and other import and export laws and regulations which may limit our ability to sell certain of our food products into these countries. We are required to maintain our distribution processes in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations. In the event that such laws and regulations change, or we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we may be prevented from trading within Israel or another part of the world. TARIFFS: The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry of the State of Israel may increase the levels of tariffs on importing goods. This would have a direct impact on us and our financial performance by increasing our costs which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. KOSHER LICENSES: Under kosher regulations, we are required to ascertain that the foodstuffs which we offer for sale bear kosher certification approved by certain authorities such as the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. There is a risk that the relevant authorities in Israel or other areas of the world responsible for issuing kosher licenses may change the criteria for obtaining such licenses. In such circumstances, we may be prohibited from obtaining kosher licenses for various products that we sell into the various kosher markets. Failure to comply with such applicable laws and regulations in relation to kosher licenses could subject us to civil sanctions, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial performance. Page 5 WE ARE DEPENDENT ON ARLA FOODS AMBA, OR ARLA, AND WE ALSO WORK WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF OTHER KEY SUPPLIERS. IF THESE SUPPLIERS RAISE PRICES OR TERMINATE THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH US, OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We are dependent on Arla, which supplies a high percentage of our dairy and dairy substitute products, although we are not dependent on any single supplier in respect of a majority of our products. Terminating the engagement with any supplier, in particular Arla, or a material change in the engagement terms for purchasing products from those suppliers may have an adverse affect on our results of operations. We have a distribution agreement with Arla pursuant to which we serve as Arla's sole agent and distributor in Israel of certain products for a five-year period beginning in March 2005. In July, 2007, the agreement was amended and the exclusivity period was extended to ten years from March, 2005. See "Item
