BUSINESS (a) General Development of the Business Canterbury Park Holding Corporation (the Company) conducts pari-mutuel wagering operations and hosts unbanked card games at its Canterbury Park Racetrack and Card Club facility (the Racetrack) in Shakopee Minnesota. The Companys pari-mutuel wagering operations include both wagering on live thoroughbred and quarter horse races at the Racetrack and wagering on races held at out-of-state racetracks that are televised simultaneously at the Racetrack (simulcasting). Unbanked card games, in which patrons compete against each other, are hosted in the Card Club at the Racetrack. The Company also derives revenues from related services and activities, such as concessions, parking, advertising, admissions, programs, a recreational vehicle park and from other entertainment events held at the Racetrack. The Company was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota on March 24, 1994, acquired the Racetrack on March 29, 1994, commenced seven day a week simulcast operations on May 6, 1994, and, beginning in May 1995, launched live horse racing and related pari-mutuel wagering on a seasonal basis, generally from early May to early September. The Company opened the Card Club on April 19, 2000 with 43 tables and expanded to 50 tables (the maximum permitted by law) in 2001. The ownership and operation of the Racetrack and the Card Club are significantly regulated by the Minnesota Racing Commission (the MRC). The Company maintains a website at www.canterburypark.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our periodic reports on Form 8-K (and any amendments to these reports) are available free of charge on our website. (b) Financial Information About Segments The Company divides its business into three segments: card club, horse racing and concessions. The card club segment represents operations of the Card Club. The horse racing segment represents simulcast and live racing operations, and the concessions segment represents food and beverage services for simulcast and live racing, the Card Club, and during special events. Further information regarding the Companys business segments is set forth in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and such information is incorporated herein by reference. (c) Narrative Description of Business (i) Card Club Operations The Card Club is open 24 hours per day, seven days per week, offering two types of unbanked card games: Poker and Casino Games. Poker games, including Texas Hold Em, 7-Card Stud and Omaha, with betting limits ranging between $2 and $60, are currently offered on a maximum of 34 tables in the poker room. A dealer, employed by the Company, regulates the play of the game at each table and deals the cards, but does not participate in play. In poker games, the Company is allowed to deduct a percentage from the accumulated wagers and impose other charges for hosting the activity, but does not have an interest in the outcome of a game. The Company may add additional prizes, awards, or money to any game for promotional purposes. The Company collects a rake of 10% of each addition to the pot, up to a maximum of $4.00 or $4.50 per hand, depending on the game, as its collection revenue. In addition, poker games offer progressive jackpots for most games. In order to fund the jackpot pool, the dealer withholds $1.00 from each final pot in excess of the $15 minimum. Casino Games, including Pai Gow Poker, Blackjack, Caribbean Stud, Let-It-Ride, Three Card Poker and Four Card Poker, are currently offered at 16 of the 50 tables in the Card Club. The Companys Casino Games are required by law to be unbanked. Unbanked refers to a wagering system or game where wagers lost or won in card games are accumulated into a player pool liability for purposes of enhancing the total amount paid back to winning players. The Company may only serve as custodian of the player pool, may not have an active interest in any card game, and does not recognize amounts that dealers win or lose during the course of play 3 as revenue. The Company also takes a rake of $.50 to $3.00 per wager, depending on the game and size of wager, for the Companys collection revenue. The only casino game to offer a progressive jackpot is Caribbean Stud. The player has the option of playing the jackpot, and has the opportunity to win some, or all, of the jackpot amount depending upon his hand. (ii) Horse Racing Operations The Companys horse racing operations consist of year-round pari-mutuel wagering on simulcast horse races (simulcasting) and live horse races (live meets) held on a seasonal basis beginning in May and concluding in September. Thoroughbred and quarter horse racing is conducted during the live meet. The Company has also conducted two-day harness racing live meets from time to time. Live Racing. The Company conducts live horse racing at its facility generally from early May until early September each year. In 2006 the Racetrack hosted 68 days of live racing beginning May 6th and concluding September 4th. The meet included 44 days of mixed thoroughbred and quarter horse racing and 24 days of thoroughbred only racing. The 2005 live meet was also 68 days long, beginning May 7th and ending September 5th, and consisted of 46 days of mixed thoroughbred and quarter horse racing and 22 days of thoroughbred only racing. Currently, Minnesota law requires the Racetrack to schedule a minimum of 125 days of live racing annually, unless the Minnesota Horsemens Benevolent and Protective Association (the MHBPA) agrees to a lesser number of live racing days. Since 1995, the MHBPA has agreed to waive the 125-day requirement and has allowed the Company to run a live meet of at least 50 days each year. After 2007, no assurance can be given that the MHBPA will agree to a shorter live meet than the 125-day statutory minimum. If the MHBPA does not agree to a live meet shorter than 125 days, the Companys operations could be adversely impacted by a decrease in the daily purses and potential reduction in quality of horses, attendance and overall handle, as well as increased operating expenses. Simulcasting. Simulcasting is the process by which live horse races held at one facility (the host track) are transmitted simultaneously to other locations that allow patrons at each receiving location (the guest track) to place wagers on races transmitted from the host track. Monies are collected at the guest track and the information with respect to the total amount wagered is electronically transmitted to the host track. All of the amounts wagered at guest tracks are combined into the appropriate pools at the host track with the final odds and payouts determined based upon all the monies in the respective pools. The Company offers full card simulcast racing (broadcasting of another racetracks entire daily live racing program) from up to 20 racetracks per day, seven days a week, 364 days per year, including Churchill Downs, Hollywood Park, Santa Anita, Gulfstream Park, Belmont Park and Saratoga Racecourse. In addition, races of national interest, such as the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Breeders Cup, supplement the regular simulcast program. The Company regularly evaluates its agreements with other racetracks in order to offer the most popular simulcast signals of live horse racing that are feasible to offer at the Racetrack. Under applicable provisions of federal and state law, the Racetrack must obtain the consent of the states regulatory authority, and the organization which represents the majority of the owners and trainers of the horses who race at the Racetrack, with respect to simulcast operations both as a host and guest track. In Minnesota such consent must be obtained from the MHBPA and the MRC. (iii) Special Events While pari-mutuel horse racing and Card Club operations are the Companys principal businesses, the Companys facilities are capable of being used for multiple purposes. In an effort to more fully utilize the property and to generate additional revenues, the Company has increasingly used its grandstand, grounds and parking lot for special events and rentals. While the use of the Companys facilities for particular special events 4 and purposes varies from year to year, the following are among the types of events and purposes for which the Companys facilities have been used: snowmobile races, major arts and crafts shows, trade shows, concerts, fund raisers, automobile shows and competitions, vehicle and boat storage, and private parties. (iv) Sources of Revenue General. The Companys revenues are principally derived from Card Club operations, wagering on live and simulcast horse races, and concession sales. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 revenues from Card Club operations represented 53.8% of total revenues, wagering on horse races generated 29.3% of total revenues and concessions revenue represented 10.8% of total revenues. Card Club Operations. The Company receives revenue from its Card Club, which operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The Company currently receives collection revenue from 34 poker tables and 16 tables offering casino games. Under Minnesota law, the Company is required to pay 10% of the first $6 million of gross Card Club revenues towards purses for live horse racing at the Racetrack. After meeting the $6 million threshold, the Company must pay 14% of gross Card Club revenues as purse monies, although by agreement with the MHBPA the Company paid 15% of Card Club collection revenues into the purse fund in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Of funds allocated for purses, the Company pays 10% of the purse monies to the State of Minnesota Breeders Fund, with the remaining 90% of purse monies divided between thoroughbred (90%), quarter horse (9%) and standard bred (1%) purse funds. Pari-mutuel wagering  General. In pari-mutuel wagering, bettors wager against each other in a pool, rather than against the operator of the facility or with preset odds. From the total amount wagered or handle, the Minnesota Pari-Mutuel Horse Racing Act (the Racing Act) specifies the maximum percentage, referred to as the takeout, which may be withheld by the Racetrack, with the balance returned to the winning bettors. The takeout constitutes one of the Racetracks primary sources of operating revenue. From the takeout, funds are set aside for purses and paid to the State of Minnesota for pari-mutuel taxes and the Minnesota Breeders Fund (the Breeders Fund) which is a fund apportioned by the MRC among various purposes related to Minnesotas horse breeding and horse racing industries. The balance of the takeout remaining after these deductions is commonly referred to as the retainage. The various forms of pari-mutuel wagering can be divided into two categories: straight wagering pools and multiple wagering pools, which are also referred to as exotic wagering pools. Examples of straight wagers include: win (a wager on one specific horse to finish first); place (a wager on one specific horse to finish first or second); and show (a wager on one specific horse to finish first, second or third). Examples of exotic wagers include: daily double (a wager in which the bettor selects the horses that will win two consecutive races); exacta (a wager in which the bettor selects the horses that will finish first and second, in order); trifecta (a wager in which the bettor selects the horses that will finish first, second and third, in order); and pick six (a wager in which the bettor selects the horses that will finish first in six consecutive races). The amount of takeout earned by the Company depends on where the race is run and the form of wager (straight or exotic). Net revenues from pari-mutuel wagering on live races run at the Racetrack consist of the total amount wagered, less the amounts paid (i) to winning patrons, (ii) for purses, (iii) to the Breeders Fund and (iv) for pari-mutuel taxes to the State of Minnesota. Net revenues from pari-mutuel wagering on races being run at out-of-state racetracks and simulcast to the Racetrack have similar expenses, but also include a host fee payment to the host track. The host fee, which is calculated as a percentage of monies wagered (generally 2.50% to 4.50%), is negotiated with the host track and must comply with state laws governing the host track. 5 Wagering on Live Races. The Racing Act establishes the maximum takeout that may be deducted from the handle. The takeout percentage on live races depends on the type of wager. The total maximum takeouts are 17% from straight wagering pools and 23% from exotic wagering pools. From this takeout, Minnesota law requires deductions for purses, pari-mutuel taxes and the Breeders Fund. While the Racing Act provides that a minimum of 8.4% of the live racing handle is to be paid as purses to the owners of the horses, the size of the purse is subject to further agreement with the horsepersons associations. The Breeders Fund receives 1% of the handle. The pari-mutuel tax applicable to wagering on all simulcast and live races is 6% of takeout in excess of $12 million during the twelve month period beginning July 1 and ending the following June 30. The following table sets forth the percentage distribution of each dollar wagered on live races at the Racetrack, as established by the Racing Act, and the Racetracks retainage: Live Racing Straight Exotic Returned to Winning Patrons 83.00 % 77.00 % Purse (1) 8.40 8.40 Minnesota Breeders Fund 1.00 1.00 Minnesota Pari-Mutuel Taxes (2) .17 .23 Racetrack Retainage (1) 7.43 13.37 Total Takeout 17.00 23.00 Total Handle 100.00 % 100.00 % (1) Minnesota law provides that the 8.40% purse payment is a minimum. The actual percentage, if any, above the minimum is determined between the Racetrack and the MHBPA. Any additional amounts paid for purses decrease the Racetracks retainage. (2) The current pari-mutuel tax structure exempts the first $12 million of takeout during a statutorily mandated twelve-month period. The total pari-mutuel tax liability for a twelve-month period will depend upon the total takeout during that period. Wagering on Simulcast Races. The amount of takeout from simulcast wagering is determined by the laws of the state in which the host track is located. In addition, the Racing Act establishes a minimum that must be set aside from simulcasting for purse payments on racing within Minnesota. Different amounts are deducted for purses from the takeout depending on whether simulcasting occurs during the Racing Season, a statutorily defined 25 week period beginning in early May each year, or outside of the Racing Season. If simulcasting occurs during the Racing Season, the amount set aside for purses further depends on whether the simulcasting is part of a full racing card that occurs during the part of the day that live races are conducted at the Racetrack. For races that are part of a full simulcast racing card that takes place within the time of live races at the Racetrack, the amount reserved for purse payout is 8.4%. For simulcasting conducted during the Racing Season that does not occur within the time period of live races, the purse is equal to 50% of the takeout remaining after deductions for pari-mutuel taxes, payments to the Breeders Fund and payments to the host racetrack for host track fees. For simulcasting conducted outside of the Racing Season, the amount that must be contributed to the purses is 25% of the takeout after deducting pari-mutuel taxes, payments to the Minnesota Breeders Fund and host fee payments to the host racetrack. 6 The following table sets forth the approximate percentage distribution of each dollar wagered for races simulcast at the Racetrack and the Racetracks retainage at December 31, 2006 and 2005: During Racing Season Concurrent with Live Card Not Concurrent with Live Card Outside of Racing Season Returned to Winning Patrons (1) 80.50 % 80.50 % 80.50 % Minnesota Breeders Fund 1.00 1.00 1.10 Minnesota Pari-Mutuel Taxes (2) .19 .19 .19 Purse (3) 8.40 7.39 1.70 Host Track Fees (4) 3.50 3.50 3.50 Racetrack Retainage (3) 6.41 7.32 13.01 Total Takeout 19.50 19.50 19.50 Total Handle 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % (1) This amount will depend upon the takeout at the host racetrack. This percentage is determined by local and state law applicable to the host track, and ranges from 75.0% to 85.0%. (2) The current pari-mutuel tax structure exempts the first $12 million of takeout during a statutorily mandated twelve-month period. The total pari-mutuel tax liability for a twelve-month period will depend upon the total takeout during that period. (3) Although Minnesota law specifies purse percentages, the actual percentage is determined by agreement between the Racetrack and the MHBPA. Until December 31, 2005, the MHBPA allowed the Company to deduct an additional 8% expense factor when calculating the purse contribution for periods outside of the racing season. For the year ended December 31, 2006 the MHBPA allowed a 3.7% expense deduction, and in 2007 the expense deduction is estimated to be 1.9%. (4) Payments to the host track generally range from 2.5% to 4.5% of total handle, subject to negotiation with each host track. For purposes of this table, the host track fee is assumed to be 3.5%. Concessions Revenue. The Company earns revenue from food and beverage sales in its restaurant, group catering areas and numerous concession stands located throughout the facility. Food and beverage sales are offered during live and simulcast racing, in the Card Club and during special events. Other Revenue. The Company generates cash revenues from the receipt of admission and reserved seating charges, preferred and valet parking, and the sales of various daily pari-mutuel publications. Additional revenues are derived from the operation of an RV Park during the summer months, and the use of the facility year round for special events such as concerts, trade and craft shows, snowmobile racing, business meetings, private parties, horse expositions and sales, boat and automobile storage and community events. The Company also generates revenue from providing advertising signage space similar to that appearing at many sports stadiums and leases excess parking lot space for various automotive activities and vehicle storage. (v) Competition From 1994 through 2004, the Company was the only Racetrack licensed to operate in the State of Minnesota. On January 20, 2005, the MRC granted a license to the North Metro Harness Initiative, LLC (NMHI) to construct and operate a harness racetrack in Columbus Township, Anoka County, MN. Construction has not begun on that facility as of the date of this report. Columbus Township is approximately 50 miles from Canterbury Park. This license authorizes NMHI to engage in pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast racing for standardbred (harness) horses. NMHI has stated they intend to commence operations in 2008. 7 Current Minnesota state law permits licensed racetracks to operate a card room with up to 50 tables subject to completion of a 50-day live race meet and regulatory approval of a card room plan of operation. NMHI has publicly stated its intentions to seek legislation to allow them to apply for a license to operate a card room prior to completion of the minimum 50 live race days, and to permit pari-mutuel simulcast racing of all breeds at its racetrack. The Company competes with other forms of gaming, principally casino-style gambling including slots and blackjack offered at numerous tribal casinos located throughout the State of Minnesota, including a large casino located approximately four miles from the Racetrack. More recently, unbanked card games have also become available at some tribal casinos. In addition, the Company competes against charitable gambling (bingo and pull tabs) and various state lottery products. The Company also faces increasing competition from offshore and out-of-state simulcast operations offering Internet and telephone account home wagering systems to Minnesota residents, although Minnesota regulatory authorities consider such wagering to be illegal. The Company also competes with other forms of entertainment in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area, including a wide range of live and televised professional and collegiate sporting events. In addition, live horse racing competes with a wide variety of summer attractions, including amusements parks, sporting events and other local activities. The Company competes with racetracks located throughout the United States in securing horses to run at the Racetrack. Attracting owners and trainers is largely dependent on the ability to offer large purses. The Company experiences significant competition for horses from racetracks located near Des Moines Iowa and Chicago Illinois, both of which offer substantially larger purses than the Company. This competition is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. (vi) Regulation General. The ownership and operation of the Racetrack in Minnesota is subject to significant regulation by the MRC under the Racing Act and the rules adopted by the MRC. The Racing Act provides for the allocation of each wagering pool to winning bettors, the Racetrack, purses, the State of Minnesota and the Breeders Fund and empowers the MRC to license and regulate substantially all aspects of horse racing in the State. The MRC, among other things, grants operating licenses to racetracks after an application process and public hearings, licenses all employees of a racetrack, jockeys, trainers, veterinarians and other participants, regulates the transfer of ownership interests in licenses, allocates live race days and simulcast-only race days, approves race programs, regulates the conduct of races, sets specifications for the racing ovals, animal facilities, employee quarters and public areas of racetracks, regulates the types of wagers on horse races, and approves significant contractual arrangements with racetracks, including management agreements, simulcast arrangements, totalizator contracts and concessionaire agreements. A federal statute, the Interstate Horse Racing Act of 1978, also provides that a racetrack must obtain the consent of the group representing the horsepersons (owners and trainers) racing the breed of horses that race a majority of the time at the racetrack, and the consent of the state agency regulating the racetrack, in order to transmit simulcast signals of its live races or to receive and use simulcast signals from other racetracks. The Company has obtained the consent of the MHBPA and MRC for receiving and sending simulcast signals. Issuance of Class A, and Class B Licenses to the Company. The Company holds a Class A License, issued by the MRC, which allows the Company to own and operate the Racetrack. The Class A License is effective until revoked or suspended by the MRC, or relinquished by the licensee. Currently the fee for a Class A License is $253,000 per fiscal year. The Company also holds a Class B License, issued by the MRC that allows the Company to sponsor and manage horse racing on which pari-mutuel wagering is conducted at its Class A licensed racetrack and on other horse races run at out-of-state locations as authorized by the MRC. The Class B License is renewable 8 each year by the MRC after a public hearing (if required by the MRC). Currently the fee for the Class B License is $500 for each assigned race day on which live racing is actually conducted and $100 for each day on which simulcasting is authorized and actually takes place. Limitation on the Number of Class A, and Class B Licenses. Pursuant to the Racing Act, so long as the Racetrack maintains its Class A License, no other Class A License may be issued to operate a racetrack in the seven county metropolitan area (the counties of Hennepin, Ramsey, Washington, Scott, Dakota, Anoka and Carver), except the MRC may issue an additional Class A License within the seven county metropolitan area, provided that the additional license may only be issued for a facility which, among other conditions, is located more than 20 miles from the Racetrack, contains a track no larger than five-eighths of a mile in circumference, and is used exclusively for standard bred (harness) racing. An additional Class A license was issued to NMHI on January 20, 2005 (see Competition above). However, as long as the Company holds its Class A License, only the Company may own and operate a racetrack in the seven county metropolitan area where thoroughbred horses and quarter horses may be raced. Limitation on Ownership and Management of an Entity, which holds a Class A License and/or Class B License. The Racing Act requires prior MRC approval of all officers, directors, 5% shareholders, or other persons having a present or future direct or indirect financial or management interest in any person applying for a Class A and Class B license, and if a change of ownership of more than 5% of the licensees shares is made after an application is filed or the license issued, the applicant or licensee must notify the MRC of the changes within five days of this occurrence and provide the information required by the Racing Act. Card Club Regulation. The MRC is authorized by law to regulate Card Club operations and the law requires that the Company reimburse the MRC for its actual costs, including personnel costs, of regulating the Card Club. For fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, and 2005, the Company paid $120,000 and $110,000, respectively, to the MRC as reimbursement for costs of regulating card club operations. The MRC issued an additional Class B License to the Company on January 19, 2000 that authorizes the Company to host unbanked card games. The Class B License is renewable each year by the MRC after a public hearing (if required by the MRC). Currently, the Class B License Fee of $10,000 per calendar year is included in the Class A License Fee of $253,000 per calendar year. Local Regulation. The Companys operations are subject to state and local laws, regulations, ordinances and other provisions affecting zoning and other matters which may have the effect of restricting the uses to which the Companys land and other assets may be used. Also, any development of the Racetrack site is, among other things, subject to applicable zoning ordinances and requires approval by the City of Shakopee and other authorities and there can be no assurance such approvals would be obtained if any development was undertaken. (vii) Legislation In 2006 the Company supported legislation to place a proposed amendment of the Minnesota Constitution on the November 2006 ballot that would have established a framework under which electronic gaming could be conducted at the Racetrack. The extension of the Companys business to include electronic gaming at the Racetrack, often referred to as a Racino, contemplated adding approximately 3,000 electronic gaming devices, as well as 40 table games, a 250-room hotel, an Olympic scale horse park and additional restaurant venues. Legislation was also introduced in 2006 to remove the 50-table limit currently imposed by Minnesota law and allow Canterbury Park to offer banked games in the Card Club. No action was, however, taken on either of these bills in 2006. In the future, the Company may support legislation similar to the bills 9 introduced in 2006, or other legislation that would increase gaming options at Canterbury Park, however, no Canterbury Park legislation has been introduced in 2007. The effort to support legislation that would increase gaming options at Canterbury Park has required, and similar efforts in the future will require, substantial expenditures. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcome of legislative activities, there can be no assurance that any such activities will result in bills favorable to the Companys interests being enacted into law. Moreover, it is possible that, as a result of the legislative process, legislation directly or indirectly adverse to the Company (including proposed legislation discussed in the paragraph below) may be enacted into law. As of March 30, 2007 bills were under consideration in the Minnesota Legislature, in both the House and the Senate, that if enacted into law would severely restrict smoking in all public places in Minnesota, including bars and restaurants generally and the Racetrack in particular. Eighteen tribal casinos in Minnesota would not, however, be covered by this legislation as currently proposed and these casinos would continue to be able to offer various gaming alternatives, including card games, in an environment that allows smoking. Therefore, if the proposed legislation is enacted into law in Minnesota in substantially its current form, the Companys revenues and profits may be materially adversely affected to the extent current and potential Racetrack customers who smoke decide to patronize tribal casinos, where smoking is permitted, rather than the Racetrack. (viii) Marketing The Companys primary market is the seven-county Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area plus the two counties to the south of the Racetrack. Current demographic information indicates that approximately 2.2 million adults age 18 and older, reside within the primary market. The City of Shakopee, located in the southwestern portion of the metropolitan area, is one of the fastest growing communities in the region and Scott County is one of the fastest growing counties in the country. Between 2005 and 2010, the population of adults age 18 and older in the primary market is expected to increase by an estimated 6.7%. To support its pari-mutuel horse racing and Card Club businesses, the Company conducts year-round marketing efforts to maintain the loyalty of live racing and simulcast patrons and attract new racing and Card Club customers. The Company utilizes newspapers and television advertising, the Internet, other print media, radio and direct mail. Often the Company combines its marketing efforts to communicate the excitement of both wagering on horse racing and card playing. In addition to its regular advertising program, the Company conducts numerous special promotions and handicapping contests to increase simulcast patronage, and maintains successful pari-mutuel player and Casino Games player rewards programs. In addition, the development and maintenance of a customer database over the past several years has enabled the Company to effectively utilize direct mail advertising. Because wagering on horse racing and playing poker and casino style card games are more complex than many other forms of gaming, such as slot machines or various lottery products, the Company continues to develop and conduct various educational programs, such as complimentary poker and casino games lessons, tours of the Racetrack, wagering and handicapping classes and contests that it believes will make pari-mutuel wagering on horse racing and card playing more understandable to the general public. (ix) Employees At March 15, 2007, the Company had 398 full-time employees and 292 part-time employees. On a seasonal basis the Company adds approximately 120 full-time and 250 part-time employees for live racing operations from early May until early September. The Companys management believes its employee relations are good. 10 (x) Executive Officers The executive officers of the Company, their ages and their positions with the Company are as follows: Name Age Position with Company Randall D.

RISK FACTORS The Company is subject to risk factors that may affect our operating results. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to, the matters discussed below as well as the additional risks discussed under Forward Looking Statements on page 33 of this Form 10-K for additional risks to which the Company is exposed. We face significant competition from other gaming operations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We face intense competition in our market, particularly competition from tribal casinos. Such facilities have the advantage of being exempt from certain state and federal taxes. We also compete with Internet wagering on horse races, other forms of gambling, other forms of entertainment and other racetracks throughout the country as previously discussed under Competition above. In addition, another racetrack may begin competing with the Company. In early 2005, the MRC granted a license to NMHI to construct and operate a harness racetrack in Columbus Township, Anoka County, MN, which is approximately 50 miles from the Racetrack. This license authorizes NMHI to engage in pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast racing for standardbred (harness) horses. In addition, Minnesota law permits licensed racetracks to operate a card room with up to 50 tables after completing a 50-day live race meet and regulatory approval of a card room plan of operation. As of the date of this report, construction had not begun on the harness racetrack, but NMHI has indicated it intends to commence harness racing operations in 2008 and will seek to begin operating a card room at the earliest possible time it is legally permitted to do so. We expect competition for our existing and future operations to increase both from NMHI, and as existing tribal casinos expand their operations. In addition, several of our tribal gaming competitors have substantially larger marketing and financial resources than we do. We are unable to predict with any certainty the effects of existing and future competition on our operating results. We are subject to extensive regulation from gaming authorities that could adversely affect us. The ownership and operation of our Racetrack and Card Club are subject to significant regulation by the MRC under the Racing Act and the rules adopted by the MRC. The MRC has the authority to impose increases in the Class A and Class B license fees. In addition, State law requires that we reimburse the MRC for its actual costs of regulating the Card Club, including personnel costs. Increases in these licensing and regulatory costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Decisions by the MRC in regard to any one or more of the following matters could also adversely affect the Companys operations: the granting of operating licenses to Canterbury Park and other racetracks after an application process and public hearings; the licensing of all employees of a racetrack, jockeys, trainers, veterinarians and other participants; regulating the transfer of ownership interests in licenses, allocating live race days and simulcast-only race days, approving race programs, regulating the conduct of races, setting 12 specifications for the racing ovals, animal facilities, employee quarters and public areas of racetracks; changes to the types of wagers on horse races; and approval of significant contractual agreements. We are subject to changes in the laws that govern our business, including the possibility of an increase in gaming taxes, which would increase our costs, and changes in other laws may adversely affect our ability to compete. Our operations and oversight by the MRC are ultimately subject to the laws of Minnesota and there exists the risk that these laws may be amended in ways adverse to our operations. In particular, we are required to pay taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. From time to time, state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of laws affecting our industry, such as the allocation of each wagering pool to winning bettors, the Racetrack, purses, and the Breeders Fund. In addition, poor economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We are also subject to laws in Minnesota that affect businesses generally. And, it is possible, as a result of the legislative process, that legislation directly or indirectly adverse to the Company (including proposed legislation discussed in the remainder of this paragraph) may be enacted into law. As of March 30, 2007 bills were under consideration in the Minnesota Legislature, in both the House and the Senate, that if enacted into law would severely restrict smoking in all public places in Minnesota, including bars and restaurants generally and the Racetrack in particular. Eighteen tribal casinos in Minnesota would not, however, be covered by this legislation as currently proposed and these casinos would continue to be able to offer various gaming alternatives, including card games, in an environment that allows smoking. Therefore, if the proposed legislation is enacted into law in Minnesota in substantially its current form, the Companys revenues may be materially adversely affected to the extent current and potential Racetrack customers who smoke decide to patronize tribal casinos, where smoking is permitted, rather than the Racetrack. Energy and fuel price increases may adversely affect our costs of operations and our revenues. Our facility uses significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy. While no shortages of energy have been experienced, increases in the cost of electricity or natural gas negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, energy and fuel price increases could negatively impact our operations by reducing disposable income of potential customers and decreasing visitation to our facility. A downturn in general economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business is subject to changes in national and local economic conditions, including changes in the economy related to threatened or actual terrorist attacks and related to the war with Iraq. A recession or downturn in the general or regional economy could result in fewer customers visiting our facility, adversely affecting our results of operations. Item 1B.
