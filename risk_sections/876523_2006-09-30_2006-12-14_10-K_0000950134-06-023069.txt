ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Important risk factors that could cause results or events to differ from current expectations are described below. These factors are not intended to be an all-encompassing list of risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance, development and results of the Company's business. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this discussion, which speaks only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to these risk factors which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereon, including without limitation, changes in the Company's business strategy or planned capital expenditures, store growth plans, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. - - THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN GOLD VALUES AND THE RESULTING IMPACT ON PAWN LENDING AND JEWELRY SALES; A SIGNIFICANT OR SUDDEN CHANGE IN GOLD VALUES MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. Pawn service charge, sales proceeds and the Company's ability to liquidate excess jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin are dependent upon gold values. The Company periodically changes its lending guidelines on jewelry in response to gold values and other market factors, such as competitor loan values. Gold scrapping revenues were $43.1 million and gross profit from gold scrapping was $14.7 million in Fiscal 2006. The impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in gold values cannot be reasonably estimated because the market and competitive response to changes in gold values is not known; however, changes in gold values would lead to changes in sales, sales margins, and pawn service charge revenues. - - CHANGES IN LAWS, GOVERNMENTAL RULES OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SPECIALTY FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S LENDING ACTIVITIES. The Company's lending is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations. Recent legislative action has concentrated on attempts to limit payday loans, including applicable rates, the ability for customers to renew their loans, and the ability to lend to military personnel. The passage of new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations could have a negative impact on the Company's lending activities, including its ability to provide credit services in Texas, where a majority of the Company's signature loans are made. THE COMPANY'S CSO REVENUES ARE DEPENDENT UPON UNAFFILIATED LENDERS' ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO MAKE LOANS TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS. The loss of the relationships with its unaffiliated lenders or a decrease in those lenders' ability to lend money could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and earnings. - - ACHIEVEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S GROWTH OBJECTIVES IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO OPEN AND ACQUIRE NEW STORES. The Company's expansion program is subject to numerous factors that cannot be predicted or controlled, such as identifying acceptable locations or attractive acquisition targets and the Company's ability to attract, train and retain qualified associates. - - FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S SALES, PAWN LOAN BALANCES, SALES MARGINS, PAWN REDEMPTION RATES, AND SIGNATURE LOAN DEFAULT AND COLLECTION RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS. The Company regularly experiences fluctuations in these operating metrics. Changes in any of these factors, as might be caused by changes in the economic environment or a significant decrease in gold prices, could materially and adversely affect the Company's profitability and ability to achieve its planned results. - - CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS COULD LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ITS PLANS. The Company requires continued access to capital; a significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect the Company's ability to achieve its planned growth and operating results. Similarly, if actual costs to build new stores significantly exceed planned costs, this could materially restrict the Company's ability to build new stores or to operate new stores profitably. 17 - - CHANGES IN COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS SOURCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ITS PLANS. The Company encounters significant competition in connection with its lending and retail operations from other pawnshops, cash advance companies and other forms of financial institutions and other retailers, many of which have significantly greater financial resources than the Company. Significant increases in these competitive influences could adversely affect the Company's operations through a decrease in the number or quality of signature and pawn loans or the Company's ability to liquidate forfeited collateral at acceptable margins. - - ONE PERSON HOLDS VOTING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY AND CONTROLS THE OUTCOME OF ALL MATTERS REQUIRING A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH MAY INFLUENCE THE VALUE OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED STOCK. Mr. Phillip E. Cohen controls all of the Company's Class B Voting Common Stock. He controls the outcome of all issues requiring a vote of stockholders, including the election of the Company's directors. - - THE COMPANY FACES OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED UNDER QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK IN ITEM 7A OF THIS FORM 10-K. 18
