Risk Factors and Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. GENERAL DESCRIPTION The terms United Fire, we, us, or our refer to United Fire & Casualty Company or United Fire & Casualty Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliate, as the context requires. We are engaged in the business of writing property and casualty insurance and life insurance. We are an Iowa corporation incorporated in January 1946. Our principal executive office is located at 118 Second Avenue SE, P.O. Box 73909, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52407-3909. Telephone: 319-399-5700. Our property and casualty insurance segment includes United Fire and the following companies:  Addison Insurance Company, an Illinois property and casualty insurer; Lafayette Insurance Company, a Louisiana property and casualty insurer; and American Indemnity Financial Corporation, a Delaware holding company; all of which are wholly owned by United Fire & Casualty Company.  American Indemnity Financial Corporation owns substantially all of American Indemnity Company, a Texas property and casualty insurer. American Indemnity Company has two wholly owned insurance subsidiaries: Texas General Indemnity Company, a Colorado property and casualty insurer, and United Fire & Indemnity Company, a Texas property and casualty insurer. United Fire Lloyds, a Texas property and casualty insurer, is an affiliate of and operationally and financially controlled by United Fire & Indemnity Company. Our life insurance segment consists of United Life Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Fire & Casualty Company. A table reflecting revenues, net income and assets attributable to our segments is included in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. As of December 31, 2005, we employed 648 full-time employees. Our website provides access to our electronic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website free of charge. We also voluntarily provide paper and electronic copies of our filings free of charge upon request. Our company website address is www.unitedfiregroup.com. MARKETING We market our products through our home office in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and in two regional locations: Westminster, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, and Galveston, Texas. We are licensed as a property and casualty insurer in 41 states, primarily in the Midwest, West and South. We have 917 independent agencies representing us and our property and casualty subsidiaries. The following states provided 55.6 percent of the direct premium volume written by the property and casualty insurance segment in 2005: Iowa (13.4%), Texas (12.9%), Colorado (10.5%), Louisiana (10.4%) and Missouri (8.4%). Our life insurance subsidiary is licensed in 27 states, primarily in the Midwest and West, and is represented by 944 independent agencies. The following states provided more than 76.5 percent of the direct premium volume written by this segment in 2005: Iowa (45.6%), Wisconsin (8.9%), Minnesota (8.4%), Nebraska (7.2%) and Illinois (6.4%). Our regional offices are staffed with underwriting, claims and marketing representatives and administrative technicians, all of whom provide support and assistance to the independent agencies. Also, home office staff technicians and specialists provide support to the subsidiaries, regional offices and independent agencies. We use management reports to monitor subsidiary and regional offices for overall results and conformity to our business policies. 1 Table of Contents We compete in the United States property and casualty insurance market with approximately 3,000 other insurers. The industry is highly competitive, with insurers competing on the basis of service, price and coverage. Because we rely heavily on independent agencies, we utilize a profit-sharing plan as an incentive for agents to place high-quality property and casualty business with us. We estimate property and casualty agencies will receive profit-sharing commissions of $20.0 million in 2006, based on business the agencies did in 2005. Our life insurance segment also operates in a highly competitive industry. We encounter significant competition in all lines of business from other life insurance companies and other providers of financial services. The life insurance segment utilizes competitive commission rates, other sales incentives and quality service to attract and maintain its relationship with independent agencies. To enhance our ability to compete, we utilize technology in a variety of ways to assist our agents and improve the delivery of service to our policyholders. For example, on our public website, which provides general company and product information, we provide a section accessible exclusively to our agents where they can quote new business, submit applications, submit change requests, report new claims, and process payments electronically. Our agents can access detailed information about their policyholders, including policy declarations, coverage forms, billing transactions and claims information. Our agents can also use the agent-only portion of our website to access their experience reports, review detailed information about our products, order sales literature and download our applications, questionnaires and other forms. Our surety bond agents can issue and upload contract, license and permit bonds online, submit new bid bond requests and view detailed bond information. Our life agents can quote new life policies, view the status of customers applications and access detailed information on our annuity, universal life, term life and whole life policies. We electronically scan and store our documents, allowing multiple users to simultaneously retrieve and view them. Additionally, we provide our policyholders secure online access to their account information. We also offer a variety of online payment options for our policyholders, including payment via credit card, debit card and electronic check. We believe our investment in technology allows us to provide enhanced service to our agents, policyholders and investors. PRODUCTS Property and casualty insurance segment We write both commercial and personal lines of property and casualty insurance. We focus on our commercial lines, which represented 91.1 percent of our direct property and casualty premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2005. Our primary commercial lines are tailored business packages that include the following coverages: fire and allied lines, other liability, automobile, workers compensation and surety. Our personal lines, which represented 8.9 percent of our direct property and casualty premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily consist of automobile and fire and allied lines coverage. The table below is a summary of our property and casualty direct premiums written by major category.

Our principal life insurance products are single premium annuities, universal life products and traditional life (primarily single premium whole life) products. Universal and traditional life products have become a larger portion of our life insurance business in recent years. Our 2005 life insurance premium revenues, as determined on the basis of statutory accounting principles, were allocated as follows: single premium annuities (approximately 64 percent); traditional life products (approximately 21 percent); and universal life products (approximately 13 percent). We also underwrite and market other traditional products, including various term life insurance products and whole life insurance. Additionally, we offer an individual disability income rider that may be attached to our life insurance products. We do not write variable annuities or variable insurance products. Statutory accounting principles require us to recognize deposits for policyholders on universal life and annuity products as premiums when they are collected. Under GAAP, we are required to recognize these deposits as policyholder liabilities. Total life insurance in force, before ceded reinsurance, is $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Traditional life insurance products represent 52 percent of our insurance in force at December 31, 2005, and 47 percent of insurance in force at December 31, 2004. Universal life insurance represents 42 percent of insurance in force at December 31, 2005, and 43 percent of insurance in force at December 31, 2004. REINSURANCE Property and casualty insurance segment Our property and casualty insurance segment follows the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposure by ceding to reinsurers a portion of the premium received and a portion of the risk under the policies reinsured. We purchase reinsurance to reduce the net liability on individual risks to predetermined limits and to protect against catastrophic losses from a single catastrophe, such as a hurricane or tornado. In 2005, we ceded written premiums of $36.1 million, which was 7.4 percent of our direct and assumed written premium. We use many reinsurers, both domestic and foreign, which helps us to avoid concentrations of credit risk associated with our reinsurance. Our principal reinsurers include Employers Reinsurance Corporation, Folksamerica Reinsurance Company, Hanover Ruckversicherungs, Platinum Underwriters Re, AXA Corporate Solutions Insurance Company, Partner Reinsurance Company of the United States, and Hartford Steam Boiler & Inspection. 3 Table of Contents We have several programs that provide reinsurance coverage. Our reinsurance programs limit the risk of loss that we retain by reinsuring direct risks in excess of our stated retention. Our property reinsurance program covers policy losses in excess of $2.0 million up to $12.0 million for 2005 and 2004, and policy losses in excess of $1.5 million up to $10.0 million for 2003. Our casualty reinsurance program covers policy losses in excess of $2.0 million up to $15.0 million for 2005 and 2004, and policy losses in excess of $1.5 million up to $12.0 million for 2003. Our personal and commercial umbrella reinsurance program generally covers policy losses in excess of $1.0 million up to $5.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Our surety reinsurance program covers 100 percent of policy losses in excess of $1.5 million up to $5.0 million for 2005 and 100 percent of policy losses in excess of $1.3 million up to $5.0 million for 2004 and 2003. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, our surety reinsurance program also covers 90 percent of policy losses in excess of $5.0 million up to $15.0 million; and 80 percent of policy losses in excess of $15.0 million up to $20.0 million. Our catastrophe reinsurance program mitigates the total direct loss we may incur from a single catastrophe. For 2005, this program provides coverage, for 95 percent of our policy losses in excess of our retention of $10.0 million for a catastrophic event, up to a limit of $115.0 million. For 2004, our program covered 95 percent of catastrophic policy losses in excess of $10.0 million up to $95.0 million. For 2003, our program covered 95 percent of catastrophic policy losses in excess of $7.5 million up to $70.0 million. The ceding of reinsurance does not legally discharge us from primary liability under our policies, and we must pay the loss if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligation. We periodically monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no uncollectible reinsurance balances that would result in a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with GAAP and industry practice, we account for premiums, both written and earned, and losses incurred net of reinsurance ceded. Historically, we have acted as a reinsurer, assuming both property and casualty reinsurance from other insurance or reinsurance companies. Most of the business we have assumed is property reinsurance, with an emphasis on catastrophe coverage. Most of our assumed reinsurance business expired on or before December 31, 2000. We continue to limit our exposure through the selective renewal of our remaining reinsurance contracts. However, we continue to have exposure related to the assumed reinsurance contracts that we have elected to continue to write and those that are in runoff status. Life insurance segment Our life insurance segment purchases reinsurance to limit the dollar amount of any one risk of loss. On standard individual life cases where the insured is age 65 or less, our retention is $.2 million. On standard individual life cases where the insured is age 66 or older, our retention is $.1 million. Our accidental death benefit rider on an individual policy is reinsured at 100 percent, up to a maximum benefit of $.3 million. Our group coverage, both life and accidental death and dismemberment, is reinsured at 50 percent. Catastrophe excess reinsurance coverage applies when three or more insureds die in a catastrophic accident. For catastrophe excess claims, we retain the first $1.0 million of ultimate net loss, and the reinsurer agrees to indemnify us for the excess up to a maximum of $5.0 million. We supplement this coverage when appropriate with known concentration coverage. Known concentration coverage is typically tied to a specific event and time period, with a threshold of a minimum number of lives involved in the event, minimum event deductible (companys retention) and a maximum payout. In 2005, we ceded written premiums of $1.8 million, which was 5 percent of our direct and assumed written premium. The ceding of reinsurance does not legally discharge United Life Insurance Company from primary liability under its policies. United Life Insurance Company must pay the loss if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations. United Life Insurance Companys primary reinsurance companies are Generali USA Life Reassurance Company, American United Life Insurance Company, Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America, and RGA Reinsurance Company. Most of these companies insure both life and accident and health risks. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no uncollectible reinsurance balances that would result in a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The life insurance segment began assuming credit life and accident and health insurance in 2002. We discontinued this practice in 2004. We continue to have exposure related to our assumed reinsurance contracts that are in a runoff status. RESERVES Property and casualty insurance segment Our property and casualty companies are required by applicable insurance laws to maintain reserves for losses and loss settlement expenses with respect to both reported and unreported losses. Loss reserves are estimates at a given time of the ultimate amount expected to be paid on losses that are, in fact, incurred. Reserves for loss settlement expenses are intended to cover the actual cost of investigating losses and defending lawsuits arising from losses. These reserves are revised based on analysis of historical results and managements review. We base estimates of losses on facts and circumstances known at the time those estimates are made. Loss reserves have two components: reserves for reported losses and reserves for incurred but not yet reported losses. We estimate reserves for reported losses in one of two ways. For some classes of reported losses under $5,000, we base reserves upon a preset 4 Table of Contents schedule determined by averaging similar claims paid over a recent twelve-month period. Annually we revise the preset schedule in response to changes in experience or as investigations progress and further information is received. We establish other reserves for reported losses on an individual case basis. Our claims personnel establish the reserves, review and revise the reserves on expected losses based on a variety of factors, including the type of claim, our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each loss, the policy provisions relating to the type of loss, trends in the legal system and other factors. For incurred but not yet reported losses, we estimate the amount of reserves for each line of business on the basis of historical and statistical information. We consider historical patterns of paid and reported claims and the probable number and nature of losses arising from occurrences that have not yet been reported. The process of estimating loss reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by our claims personnel. Because reserves are estimates of the amount expected to be paid based on facts and circumstances known at any given time, we continuously review our loss reserves. During the claims settlement period, which may extend over a long period of time, our claims personnel may become aware of additional facts regarding claims and trends that cause us to refine and adjust our estimates of ultimate liability. Consequently, actual loss reserves may deviate significantly from the estimates reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such deviations may be significant. We do not discount reserves based on the time value of money. We consider inflation in the reserving process by reviewing cost trends, loss settlement expenses and historical reserving results, and likely future economic conditions. The table on the following page shows the calendar year development of net loss and loss settlement expense reserve liabilities and payments for our property and casualty companies for the years 1996 through 2004. The top line of the table shows the estimated net liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses recorded at the end of each of the indicated years. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss settlement expenses for losses arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the end of each year, including an estimate for losses that had been incurred but not yet reported, net of applicable ceded reinsurance. The first portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the losses for individual years. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily exist in the future. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table. The second portion of the table displays cumulative net losses and loss settlement expenses paid for each of the years indicated. The third portion of the table displays the reinsurance recoverable, the re-estimated amount of reinsurance recoverable and the resulting gross liabilities. 5 Table of Contents (Dollars in Thousands) Years Ended December 31 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Settlement Exp: $ 209,876 $ 218,912 $ 243,006 $ 310,637 $ 320,506 $ 326,910 $ 356,889 $ 399,740 $ 436,280 $ 559,963 Net Liability Re-Estimated as of One year later 176,332 192,297 213,047 273,706 273,469 315,854 344,590 361,153 358,796 Two years later 169,348 185,700 233,325 261,217 290,872 323,354 340,502 331,693 Three years later 164,030 198,298 226,353 273,921 300,011 321,168 324,582 Four years later 172,366 198,931 232,851 279,740 302,884 318,125 Five years later 176,411 202,765 235,860 279,653 298,428 Six years later 177,384 208,071 235,560 280,983 Seven years later 181,611 206,938 236,844 Eight years later 181,512 206,962 Nine years later 181,771 Net Redundancy $ 28,105 $ 11,950 $ 6,162 $ 29,654 $ 22,078 $ 8,785 $ 32,307 $ 68,047 $ 77,484 Cumulative Amount of Net Liability Paid Through: One year later $ 61,694 $ 62,988 $ 71,251 $ 97,021 $ 110,516 $ 112,546 $ 107,271 $ 100,895 $ 110,016 Two years later 93,599 97,142 123,965 154,886 166,097 172,538 172,158 167,384 Three years later 110,531 122,818 155,622 189,730 204,792 215,002 214,307 Four years later 122,413 143,216 176,376 213,190 230,889 240,973 Five years later 134,193 158,306 190,644 231,838 245,677 Six years later 142,955 168,310 199,802 241,540 Seven years later 150,346 175,381 205,149 Eight years later 153,955 179,261 Nine years later 157,074 Net Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Settlement Exp: $ 209,876 $ 218,912 $ 243,006 $ 310,637 $ 320,506 $ 326,910 $ 356,889 $ 399,740 $ 436,280 $ 559,963 Reinsurance Recoverable 11,331 12,856 8,111 27,606 37,526 36,909 35,760 27,307 28,609 60,137 Gross Liability $ 221,207 $ 231,768 $ 251,117 $ 338,243 $ 358,032 $ 363,819 $ 392,649 $ 427,047 $ 464,889 $ 620,100 Net Re-Estimated Liability $ 181,771 $ 206,962 $ 236,844 $ 280,983 $ 298,428 $ 318,125 $ 324,582 $ 331,693 $ 358,796 Re-Estimated Reinsurance Recov. 17,088 14,827 11,089 27,275 34,712 37,133 41,039 35,795 34,703 Gross Re-Estimated Liability $ 198,859 $ 221,789 $ 247,933 $ 308,258 $ 333,140 $ 355,258 $ 365,621 $ 367,488 $ 393,499 Gross Redundancy $ 22,348 $ 9,979 $ 3,184 $ 29,985 $ 24,892 $ 8,561 $ 27,028 $ 59,559 $ 71,390 The table above illustrates a year-to-year cumulative redundancy in our net reserves for liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses. Because establishing reserves is inherently uncertain, an analysis of factors affecting reserves can produce a range of reasonable estimates. We believe that our redundancies are the result of a variety of factors, including:  establishing reserves that are appropriate and reasonable, but assuming a pessimistic view of potential outcomes;  using claims negotiation to control the size of settlements;  assuming that we have a percentage of liability for all claims, even though the issue of liability may in some cases be resolved totally in our favor;  promoting claims management services to encourage return-to-work programs, case management by nurses for serious injuries and management of medical provider services and billings; and  using programs and services to help prevent fraud and to assist in favorably resolving cases. The determination of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance reserves, particularly those relating to liability lines, reflects significant judgment factors. If, during the course of our regular monitoring of reserves, we determine that coverages previously written were incurring higher than expected losses we would take action that could include increasing the related reserves. Any adjustments we make to reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which we make those adjustments. As required by state law, we engage an independent actuary to render an opinion as to the adequacy of the statutory reserves we establish. The actuarial opinion is filed in those states where we are licensed. There are no material differences between our statutory reserves and those established under GAAP. Over the course of the last 10 years, our net reserves for losses and loss settlement expenses have exceeded our incurred losses and loss settlement expenses. Because establishing reserves is inherently uncertain, an analysis of factors affecting reserves can produce a 6 Table of Contents range of reasonable estimates. Our philosophy is to establish reserves that are appropriate and reasonable, but assume a pessimistic view of potential outcomes. Generally, our best estimate of reserves is slightly above the midpoint of a range of reasonable estimates. We believe that it is appropriate and reasonable to establish a best estimate within a range of reasonable estimates for use in determining reserves, especially when we are reserving for claims for bodily injury, disabilities and similar claims, for which settlements and verdicts can vary widely. Our reserving philosophy may result in favorable development in succeeding years that will decrease loss and loss settlement expenses for prior year claims in the year of adjustment. While we realize that this philosophy, coupled with what we believe to be aggressive and successful claims management and loss settlement practices, has resulted in year-to-year net redundancies in reserves, we believe our approach is better than experiencing year-to-year uncertainty as to the adequacy of our reserves. We believe the reserves for our property and casualty insurance segment at December 31, 2005, are appropriate. The increases over the last 10 years in liability for net unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses reflect our increased business. In determining the appropriateness of our reserves, we rely upon the opinion of an independent actuary that our reserves meet the requirements of applicable insurance laws, are consistent with reserves that are computed in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and principles, and make a reasonable provision in the aggregate for all unpaid loss and loss settlement expense obligations under the terms of our insurance policies and agreements. We also consider state regulatory reviews and examinations and our own experience. Because we are comfortable with our reserving experience, we have not made any significant changes in our reserving methodology or philosophy. Life insurance segment The reserves reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements are calculated in accordance with GAAP. We calculate our annuity and universal life policy deposits in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses on the Sale of Investments. Under Statement No. 97, we establish a benefit reserve at the time of policy issuance in an amount equal to the deposits received. Subsequently, we adjust the benefit reserve for any additional deposits, interest credited and partial or complete withdrawals. We base statutory reserves for the life insurance segment upon applicable Iowa insurance laws. Reserves determined for statutory purposes are based upon mortality rates and interest rates specified by state law. Our life insurance subsidiarys reserves meet or exceed the minimum statutory requirements. Independent consulting actuaries assist us in developing and analyzing our reserves. INVESTMENTS We comply with state insurance laws that prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments that may be made by insurance companies. We determine the mix of our investment portfolio based upon these state laws, our liquidity needs, our tax position and general market conditions. We also consider the timing of our obligations, as cash must be available when obligations are due to be paid. We make modifications to our investment portfolio as the conditions listed above change. We manage all but a small portion of our investment portfolio internally. The property and casualty insurance segments assets are invested to meet liquidity needs and maximize after-tax returns with appropriate risk diversification. The life insurance segments assets are invested primarily in investment grade fixed maturities in order to meet liquidity needs, maximize the investment return and achieve a matching of assets and liabilities. Investment results for the periods indicated are summarized in the following table, which is presented in accordance with GAAP. (Dollars in Thousands) Annualized Yield on Average Invested Investment Income, Average Invested Years ended December 31 Assets(1) Net(2) Assets 2005 $ 2,065,775 $ 118,847 5.8 % 2004 1,959,729 111,474 5.7 % 2003 1,836,872 108,540 5.9 % (1) Average based on invested assets (including money market accounts) at beginning and end of year.

RISK FACTORS RISK FACTORS We provide the following discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business. These are factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We could also be adversely affected by other factors in addition to those listed here. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Risks relating to our business  Catastrophe losses are unpredictable and may adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, hailstorms, fires, explosions, earthquakes and other events, including terrorist acts. For example, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita swept through the Gulf Coast region of the United States in 2005, severely impacting our financial results for the year. Catastrophe claims arise principally under our commercial insurance policies, but we also have exposure under our personal insurance policies. Our automobile business exposes us to losses arising from floods and other perils. Property damage resulting from catastrophes is the greatest risk of loss we face in the ordinary course of our business. Because the occurrence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and may vary significantly from year to year, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations. Claims from catastrophic events could reduce our net income, cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Catastrophes may also negatively affect our ability to write new business. Increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future.  Risks and uncertainties our business is subject to may potentially impair our ability to maintain our favorable financial strength ratings and the financial strength ratings of insurance company subsidiaries. This could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with our competitors; and our ability to sell insurance policies could decline, reducing our sales and earnings. Third-party rating agencies assess and rate the claims-paying ability of insurers and reinsurers based on criteria established by the agencies. These financial strength ratings are used by policyholders, insurers, reinsurers and insurance and reinsurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers and reinsurers. Furthermore, if the rating of a reinsurer is unfavorable, the rating agency may reduce the rating of an insurance company purchasing reinsurance from that reinsurer. We believe that the ratings assigned by third-party rating agencies are an important factor in marketing our products. Our ability to retain our existing business and to attract new business in our insurance operations depends largely on our ratings by these agencies. If an agency downgrades our ratings in the future, it is likely that we would not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and our ability to sell insurance policies could decline. If that happens, our sales and earnings would decrease. Rating agencies evaluate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to pay claims, factors that are more relevant to policyholders than investors. Financial strength ratings by rating agencies are not ratings of securities or recommendations to buy, hold or sell any security.  Our reserves for losses and costs related to settlement of losses and our annuity reserves may be inadequate, which would have an unfavorable impact on our financial results. Our reserves for claims and future policy benefits may prove to be inadequate, which may result in a downgrade of our financial strength rating or the financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries. We establish property and casualty reserves for loss and loss settlement expenses based on assumptions and estimates of damages and liabilities incurred. For our life insurance products, our actuaries calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid, and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we receive. Our reserves are only estimates; we determine the amount of these reserves based on our best estimate and judgment of the losses and costs we will incur on existing insurance policies. Because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves, we cannot precisely determine the ultimate amounts that we will pay for or the timing of payment of actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. The following factors may have a substantial impact on our future loss experience:  the length of time between the actual occurrence of a claim, and the report date of the claim; 8 Table of Contents  the amounts of claims settlements and awards;  changes in medical care, including the effect of inflation;  the cost of home/business repair, including the effect of inflation and the accessibility of labor and materials;  state regulatory requirements; and  the judicial environment, including, but not limited to, changes in case law, the impact of jury awards, and the interpretation of policy provisions. Actual claims and claim expenses paid might exceed our reserves. If our reserves are insufficient, or if we believe our reserves are insufficient, to cover our actual loss and loss settlement expenses, we would have to augment our reserves and incur charges to our earnings. These charges could be material.  Interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect our profitability. Some of our products, principally fixed annuities, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our spread, which is the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support our obligations under the contracts. In periods of increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace our invested assets with higher yielding assets to the extent needed to fund the higher rates we must pay with respect to our interest-sensitive products to keep them competitive. Consequently, we may have to accept a lower spread, and thus lower profitability, or face a decline in sales and loss of existing contracts and related assets. In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments then available. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals and because many of our policies have guaranteed interest rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. Due to the reinvestment risk described above, a decline in market interest rates available on investments could also reduce our return from investments of capital that do not support particular policy obligations, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The adverse effect on us of fluctuations in interest rates may be exacerbated because we currently maintain, and intend to continue to maintain, a large portion (approximately 89 percent) of our investment portfolio in fixed income securities, including our portfolio of preferred debt trading securities. Generally, the fair value of these investments increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with changes in interest rates. Because we classify approximately 96 percent of our fixed income securities as available-for-sale, we must report the value of those investments at their current fair value. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates may result in fluctuations in the valuation of our fixed income investments, which could affect our stockholders equity. Increases in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals from insurance products. In periods of increasing interest rates, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns. This process may lead to an outflow of cash from our business. These outflows may require us to sell invested assets at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. In addition, unanticipated withdrawals and terminations also may require us to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, which would increase our expenses in the current period. The fair value of securities in our investment portfolio may fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions or events relating to a particular issuer of securities. Changes in the fair value of securities in our investment portfolio are reported in our financial statements and, therefore, could result in realized or unrealized investment losses, thereby affecting our stockholders equity. We are exposed to the chance that issuers of bonds that we hold will not be able to pay principal or interest when it is due. Increasing credit defaults and impairments may cause write-downs in the value of the bonds we hold. Pervasive deterioration in the credit quality of issuers, changes in interest rate levels, and changes in interest rate spreads between types of investments, could significantly affect the value of our invested assets and our earnings.  Our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry. The financial results of companies in the property and casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. Rates for property and casualty insurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of our control, including market and competitive conditions and regulatory issues. Any significant decrease in the rates for property and 9 Table of Contents casualty insurance could reduce our net income. Our profitability, like the profitability of other companies in the industry, can be affected significantly by:  rising levels of actual costs that we are unaware of at the time we price our products;  volatile and unpredictable developments, including manmade, weather-related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks;  changes in loss reserves resulting from general claims and the legal environment, as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of our liability develop; and  fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect our return on invested assets and may impact our ultimate payout of losses. The demand for property and casualty insurance can also vary significantly, rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as that activity decreases. The property and casualty insurance industry historically is cyclical in nature. Fluctuations in demand and competition could produce underwriting results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our investment returns, and thus our profitability, may also be adversely affected from time to time by conditions affecting a specific investment and, more generally, by stock and other market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions. Our ability to make a profit on insurance products, fixed annuities and products with guaranteed interest features depends in part on the returns on investments supporting our obligations under these products. As previously described, the value of specific investments may fluctuate substantially.  Our geographic concentration in both our property and casualty insurance and life insurance segments tie our performance to the business, economic and regulatory conditions of those states. The following states provided 55.6 percent of the direct premium volume in the property and casualty insurance segment in 2005: Iowa (13.4%), Texas (12.9%), Colorado (10.5%), Louisiana (10.4%) and Missouri (8.4%). The following states provided 76.5 percent of the direct premium volume in the life insurance segment in 2005: Iowa (45.6%), Wisconsin (8.9%), Minnesota (8.4%), Nebraska (7.2%), and Illinois (6.4%). Unfavorable business, economic, or regulatory conditions in these states could negatively affect our company. In addition, our exposure to severe losses from localized natural perils, such as hurricanes or hailstorms, is increased in those areas where we have written significant numbers of property and casualty insurance policies.  If we cannot adequately meet our independent agents needs or keep pace with our competitors future technological advances, we may lose business. We do business with 917 property and casualty insurance agencies in 41 states and 944 life insurance agencies in 27 states. We have contracts with all of our agencies. Our agencies are independent and offer products of competing companies. Our agencies require the timely processing of applications and claims, as well as prompt attention to their questions and concerns. We use technology to provide our agencies with information and to process applications for insurance coverage and claims. Examples of such technology include the use of the Internet to provide agencies with access to policy information and to submit underwriting and claims information. Although we believe we have good relationships with our independent agents, if we are unable to continue to adequately meet our independent agents needs and keep pace with our competitors future technological advances, we may not be able to retain the agents business.  If market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for significant amounts of risk, especially catastrophe risks that we and our insurance company subsidiaries underwrite. The availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions that are beyond our control. The availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase may affect the level of our business and profitability. Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. We may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposure to risk would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures, we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite, especially risks related to catastrophes. 10 Table of Contents  We cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay claims in a timely fashion, if at all. As a result, we could experience losses. We transfer some of the risk we have from the direct policies that we write to reinsurance companies in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred, it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders. Our reinsurers may not pay what they owe us on a timely basis or at all. If our reinsurers fail to pay us or fail to pay us on a timely basis, our financial results would be adversely affected. Losses incurred by some of our reinsurers from Hurricane Katrina may adversely affect their financial resources, which could affect their ability to pay us.  Legal and regulatory proceedings may have an adverse effect on our business. As a member of the insurance industry, we are subject to various lawsuits arising out of the ordinary course of business, some of which involve claims for significant and/or uncertain amounts and the resolutions of which are unpredictable. This litigation is based on a range of issues including insurance and claim settlement practices. For further information about our significant pending litigation, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings.  We face significant competitive pressures in our business that could cause demand for our products to fall and reduce our revenue and our profitability. The insurance industry is highly competitive. In our property and casualty business and in our life business, we compete, and will continue to compete, with dozens of major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and smaller regional companies, as well as mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies. Some of our competitors have far greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our premium revenue and our profitability could decline if we lose business to competitors offering similar or better products at or below our prices. We price our insurance products based on estimated profit margins, and we do not expect to be able to significantly reduce our current estimated profit margins in the near future. Many of our competitors, however, are better capitalized than we are and may be able to withstand significant reductions in their profit margins. If our competitors decide to target our policyholder base by offering lower-priced insurance, we may not be able to respond competitively. In addition, a number of legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in our industry. Increased competition from these developments could cause the demand for our products to fall, which could reduce our revenue and our profitability. These legislative or industry developments include:  the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which permits financial services companies such as banks and brokerage firms to engage in the insurance business, could result in increased competition from new entrants to our markets;  the formation of new insurers and an influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their business as a result of better pricing and/or terms;  programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas; and  changing practices caused by the Internet, such as the direct purchase by consumers of life and property and casualty insurance products, which have led to greater competition in the insurance business. These developments and others could make the property and casualty insurance marketplace more competitive by increasing the number and strength of competitors. In that event, recent favorable industry trends that have reduced insurance and reinsurance supply and increased demand could be reversed and may negatively influence our ability to maintain or increase premium rates. Accordingly, these developments could reduce our revenue and our profitability.  Because we are heavily regulated by the states in which we operate, we may be limited in the way we operate. We are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by the states in which we operate. Governmental agencies exercise broad administrative power to regulate many aspects of the insurance business. This regulation covers, among other things:  standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;  restrictions on the amount, type, nature, quality and concentration of investments;  restrictions on the types of terms that we can include in the insurance policies we offer; 11 Table of Contents  certain required methods of accounting;  reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;  premium rates;  marketing practices;  policy forms;  capital adequacy;  the amount of dividends that can be paid;  licensing of agents;  approval of reinsurance contracts and intercompany contracts;  approval of proxy statements; and  potential assessments in order to provide funds to settle covered claims under insurance policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies. In addition, state insurance holding company statutes generally require prior notice or approval of changes in control of an insurer or its holding company. Regulatory authorities enforcing these statutes are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than stockholders. Regulations of state insurance departments may affect the cost or demand for our products and may impede us from obtaining premium rate increases or taking other actions we might wish to take to increase our profitability. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could stop or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or assess fines or penalties against us.  Our success depends on retaining our current key personnel and attracting additional key personnel. Our performance depends on the continued service of our senior management. None of our senior management is bound by an employment agreement nor do we have key person insurance on any of our senior management. Our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, hire, train and retain highly skilled managerial, underwriting, claims, risk management, sales, marketing and customer support personnel. In addition, new hires frequently require extensive training before they achieve desired levels of productivity. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may fail to retain our key employees or to attract or retain other highly qualified personnel.  The majority owner of our common stock may take actions conflicting with other stockholders interests. The majority owner has a beneficial interest in, and votes or controls the disposition of, 22.2 percent of our issued and outstanding common stock. He is in a position to strongly influence the outcome of substantially all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including mergers involving our company, sales of all, or substantially all, of our assets and the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation. Also, he may have interests different than, or adverse to, those of our other stockholders. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
