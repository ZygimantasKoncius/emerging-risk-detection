Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Any of the risk factors we describe below could severely harm our business, financial condition and operating results. The market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON OUR INFORMATION SERVICES DIVISION FOR ALL OF OUR REVENUE. In each of 2006 and 2005, our information services segment accounted for nearly 100% of our revenue. Despite licensing tagatose in 1996 for food and beverage use, our principal biotechnology product, we have yet to receive any substantial royalties from the sales of tagatose by our licensee. We are actively pursuing various non-food uses of Naturlose, including as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes. Thus, we have incurred substantial and continuing losses in our biotechnology segment which have adversely affected our overall financial results. If we continue to be unsuccessful in commercializing our biotechnology products, our financial results will continue to be adversely affected to the detriment of our stock price. OUR LARGEST INFORMATION SERVICES CONTRACT WAS AWARDED TO A COMPETITOR. In October 2006, the Company agreed to a $6 million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the governments award of the National Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) contract to ReserveAmerica, a Ticketmaster subsidiary. The Companys National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007. The National Park Service contract contributed $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. We will need to replace it with other work to avoid an adverse impact on our financial results. OUR INFORMATION SERVICES BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CONTRACTING OR FISCAL POLICIES OF THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. We derive substantial revenue from contracts with the U.S. federal government and we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in U.S. federal government contract programs. Accordingly, changes in U.S. federal government contracting policies could directly affect our financial performance. Among the factors that could have a material adverse affect on our U.S. federal government contracting business are: · budgetary constraints affecting U.S. federal government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policies or available funding; · technological developments; · U.S. federal governmental shutdowns and other potential delays in the government appropriations process; · delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices due to problems with, or upgrades to, government information systems, or for other reasons; · competition and consolidation in the information services industry; and · general economic conditions. OUR INFORMATION SERVICES BUSINESS IS RELIANT ON TECHNOLOGY. We have devoted significant resources to developing and acquiring specialized hardware and software in our information services business. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to select, invest in, acquire and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely ba-sis. We may not be successful in these efforts or in anticipating developments in technology. In addition, competitors could develop similar applications. Third parties could independently develop similar technology, obtain unauthorized access to our proprietary technology or misappropriate technology to which we have granted access. Failure to remain current with technology or misappropriation of our technology could adversely affect our ability to compete for information services business and could lead to reduced business and reduced financial results. WE HAVE NOT YET SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZED NATURLOSE. We are in the process of attempting to develop other uses of tagatose, under the brand name Naturlose, in non-food products such as a treatment for diabetes, toothpaste, mouthwash, and over-the-counter and pharmaceutical drugs. Efforts are presently limited to the Type 2 diabetes clinical trial and toothpaste developments because of cash limitations. To date, we have yet to secure any substantial revenue from Naturlose sales. One of the hurdles we will have to overcome is that our foreign licensee for tagatose (which has the right to manufacture tagatose) does not currently have sufficient capacity to manufacture enough tagatose to supply both food and nonfood markets if such markets mature and grow. Failure to successfully commercialize Naturlose may adversely affect our stock price. 8 OTHER BIOTECH PRODUCTS ARE STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE. We are developing other biotech products. None of these have been developed to a stage where any significant revenue has been generated. Development of products will require significant additional research and development. Such additional effort will require substantial funding which may not be available to us. Further, our research and development activities may not result in any saleable products. It is also possible that we will license or seek an affiliation with a third party to bring some products to market. In such an event, we would likely have minimal control over the manufacture and marketing of such products. DEVELOPMENT OF ANY BIOTECH PRODUCTS WILL DEPEND ON OBTAINING FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY APPROVALS. Development of new products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries. These rigorous regulatory approval processes can take five to ten years or more and require the expenditure of substantial resources. We may not be able to obtain the necessary approvals for clinical testing or for the marketing of products. Continuing failure to commercialize biotechnology products may adversely affect our financial results and stock price. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN PATENT PROTECTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS. We have several patents for tagatose and other products under development. We may not be able to obtain additional patents. Further, future patents may not be held valid if subsequently challenged. Failure to obtain and maintain patent protection for our biotechnology products may further delay or eliminate our ability to commercialize such products, which may adversely affect our financial results and stock price. WE HAVE SUSTAINED LOSSES IN THE PAST AND WE MAY SUSTAIN LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. We have incurred losses in prior years, including the years 2005 and 2004. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $2.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, included $6 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture settlement. We may not return to profitable operations. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING THAT WE WILL NEED. During 2006, our working capital increased by $7.7 million, largely as a result of proceeds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture settlement and proceeds from stock issuances. In recent years, we have funded our operations through private placements of our common stock and through the exercise of warrants issued in connection with such private placement transactions. We believe that we will need to raise additional funding to continue to finance our product development operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain required financing may cause us to curtail or cease our operations. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN OUR KEY EXECUTIVES AND PERSONNEL. As a small company, our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and other positions. None of our key employees have employment agreements. The loss of the services of one or more of such employees could have a material adverse effect on us. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION BY COMPETITORS IN BOTH DIVISIONS. Our competitors in the information services business are numerous. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Our principal information services competitor, ReserveAmerica, is a division of Ticketmaster which is a subsidiary of IAC/InterActive Corp., a significantly larger public company than Spherix. Our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and biotechnology products that are more effective than ours. RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK THE PRICE OF SPHERIXS COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN HIGHLY VOLATILE DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO EFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK. Our common stock has traded as low as $1.18 and as high as $3.92 between January 2, 2006 and December 29, 2006. Some of the factors leading to this volatility include: 9 · relatively small amounts of our stock trading on any given day; · fluctuations in our operating results; · announcements of technological innovations or new products which we or our competitors make; · developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights. CORNELL CAPITAL PARTNERS WILL PAY LESS THAN THE MARKET PRICE AND WILL HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO SELL ITS SHARES, WHICH MAY CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. Cornell Capital Partners will purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (SEDA) at a purchase price that is less than the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. Cornell Capital Partners will have an incentive to immediately sell any shares of our common stock that it purchases pursuant to the SEDA to realize a gain on the difference between the purchase price and the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. To the extent Cornell Capital Partners sells its common stock, the common stock price may decrease. NEW SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DILUTION FROM OUR SALE OF SHARES UNDER THE SEDA. The sale of shares pursuant to the SEDA will have a dilutive impact on our stockholders. As a result, our net income per share could decrease in future periods, and the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the lower our stock price, the more shares of common stock we will have to issue under the SEDA. If our stock price is lower, then our existing stockholders would experience greater dilution. OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE DELISTED FROM NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET SYSTEM IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS. We were previously advised that we were in danger of our common stock being delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market due to our stockholders equity falling below the $10 million minimum requirement. At December 31, 2006, the Companys shareholders equity was $14.6 million. If at some point we are unable to meet the listing standards, we intend to apply to list our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK ARE NOT LIKELY. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, in order to provide funds for use in the operation and expansion of our business and for further research and development. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Investors must look solely to appreciation in the market price of the shares of our common stock to obtain a return on their investment. BECAUSE OF THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT AND ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, A THIRD PARTY MAY BE DISCOURAGED FROM MAKING A TAKEOVER OFFER WHICH COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. In 2001, we adopted a shareholder rights plan. The effect of this rights plan and of certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us or replacing members of our board of directors, even if the acquisition or the replacements would be beneficial to our stockholders. These factors could also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of the common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions. INSIDERS OWN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR STOCKHOLDERS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF KEY TRANSACTIONS. As of December 31, 2006, our officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, our officers and directors are able to exert considerable influence over the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, including the election of our Board of Directors. The voting power of these stockholders could prevent or frustrate attempts to effect a transaction that is in the best interests of the other stockholders and could also discourage others from seeking to purchase our common stock, which might depress the price of our common stock. WE EXPERIENCE QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenue and operating income as a result of many factors, including the seasonality of our information services business, timing of customers budget processes and slowdowns or accelerations of work by customers. General work economic conditions may result in customer deferral of projects or cancellation in planned expenditures. These factors may adversely affect our financial results and our stock price. 10 Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. Item
