The reduction in revenue was due to decreased sales of the Groups consumer health care products of A$0.3 million or 4%. Other revenue for the year ended 30 June, 2010 was $1.9 million, a decrease of $0.9 million from $2.8 million for the twelve months ended 30 June, 2009. The decrease in other revenue was mainly due to the lower interest receipts on lower cash balances, combined with unfavourable exchange rate impacts on royalty receipts. Consumer product sales Sales of consumer health care products for the year ended 30 June, 2010 were $8.0 million, a decrease of $0.3 million from $8.3 million for the year ended 30 June, 2009. The decrease was related to a number of factors including discontinuing sales of the Aliten weight loss product in Australia and decreased consumer demand in the UK associated with the economic downturn. Sales were negatively effected by exchange rate movements as a result of a strengthening of the AUD compared to both the GBP and CAD. These decreases were partially offset by increased export sales from Australia to overseas distributor partners. Sales in Australia for the year ended June 30, 2010 was A$3.5 million, a decrease of A$0.2 million or 5% from A$3.7 million for the previous year. Sales in North America decreased A$0.3 million to A$1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2010 compared to A$2.1 million for the previous year. Regulatory issues in Canada, which were resolved during the year, combined with the impact of negative exchange rate movements contributed to this decrease. Sales revenue in Europe remained constant at A$2.2 million for the year. Strong sales growth in Italy has offset declining sales in UK caused by the continuing economic downturn and negative exchange rate movements when converting sales denominated in GBP to A$. Costs and expenses Total expenses before interest and tax decreased by A$9.8 million to A$25.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2010 compared to A$34.9 million for the year ended June 2009. Cost of sales decreased A$0.3 million corresponding with reduced sales. Cost of sales, which includes only costs associated with the sale of goods, decreased A$0.3 million corresponding with reduced sales from Australia and North America and improved gross margins on consumer product sales as a result of favorable currency movements on purchasing active ingredients from an overseas third party manufacturer. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2010 continued to decline due to the impact of the favorable currency movements on the cost of active ingredient in relative A$. 38 Research and development expenses decreased by A$10.7 million reflecting cost savings following the termination of the Phase III Ovature clinical trial. Selling and promotional expenses decreased by $2.4 million as a result of reduced marketing expenses associated with discontinuing sales of Aliten. General and Administrative Expenses increased by A$3.7 million primarily as a result of staff terminations described below. Net loss The operating loss attributable to Novogen shareholders for the financial year, after allowing for losses attributable to non-controlling interests of $2.9 million, reduced by $6.6 million or 35% to $12.3 million from a loss of $18.9 million for the previous year. The net loss from continuing operations after income tax for the consolidated Group for the year ended 30 June, 2010 reduced by $8.6 million to $15.2 million from $23.8 million for the previous year. The reduction in the Groups net loss for the year ended 30 June, 2010 was primarily due to costs savings related to the termination of the Phase III Ovature clinical trial, combined with reduced marketing expenses associated with discontinuing sales of Aliten. Other savings in administrative expenses were offset by the termination payments made to the Companys CEO in December 2009 and termination payments for a number of other senior management staff as part of the Company restructure which took place in June, 2010, amounting in total to approximately A$3 million. This restructure is part of the continuing strategy to focus the Groups resources towards oncology drug research and development. Operating Results  Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenue The Group earned gross revenues for the year ended June 30, 2009 of A$11.1 million versus A$13.3 million in the previous corresponding period, a reduction of A$2.2 million. The reduction in revenue was due to decreased sales of the Groups consumer health care products of A$1.1 million or 12%. Other revenue also reduced by A$1.1 million to A$2.8 million verses A$3.9 million for the previous corresponding period. The decrease in other revenue was mainly due to the reduced interest received on cash balances reflecting lower global interest rates. Consumer product sales Sales of consumer health care products decreased by A$1.1 million to A$8.3 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2009 from A$9.4 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008. Sales in Australasia (including sales to export markets) for the year ended June 30, 2009 were A$4.9 million, an increase of A$0.1 million or 2% from A$4.8 million for the 39 previous year. Canadian sales for the year ended June 30, 2009 reduced by A$0.2 million to A$2.1 million from A$2.3 million for the previous 12 month period. The reduction was due to difficult market conditions and a significant downturn in the consumer market for menopause products. Sales revenue in the UK decreased by A$0.3 million to A$1.4 million for the twelve month period to June 30, 2009 compared to A$1.7 million for the same period last year. The UK sales decline was caused by the economic downturn with consumers turning away from premium brands and a reduction in the supplement market for menopause. Costs and expenses Total expenses before interest and tax decreased by A$4.8 million to A$34.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 compared to A$39.7 million for the year ended June 2008. Cost of sales, which includes only costs associated with the sale of goods, decreased A$1.6 million corresponding with reduced sales from Europe and Canada and improved gross margins on consumer product sales through sourcing active ingredients from a lower cost third party manufacturer, following the decision to close the Companys production facility at Wyong NSW in 2007. Sales of product manufactured from lower cost active commenced during fiscal year 2008 having a favourable impact on cost of sales for part of that year. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2009 continued to decline due to the annualized impact of a lower cost active ingredient. General and Administrative Expenses were favourably impacted by A$3.1 million due primarily to favourable currency movements. These savings were partially offset by an increase in selling and promotional expense of A$0.4 million. This increase was due to expenses associated with a decision to discontinue the weight loss product Aliten following disappointing consumer uptake post launch. Net loss The operating loss attributable to Novogen shareholders for the financial year, after allowing for losses attributable to minority interests of A$4.9 million, reduced by A$1.4 million to A$18.9 million from a loss of A$20.3 million for the previous year. The net loss from ordinary activities after income tax for the consolidated Group for the year ended June 30, 2009 reduced by A$1.0 million to $23.8 million from A$24.8 million for the previous year. The reduction in the Groups net loss for the year ended June 30, 2009 was due to reduced revenues and other incomes being offset by reduced expenditures. Liquidity and capital resources Cash resources At 30 June, 2010 the Group had total funds of $15.1 million compared to $33.3 million at 30 June, 2009. 40 During fiscal 2010, the Company had net cash outflows from operating activities of A$16.6 million compared to cash outflows of A$20.6 million in fiscal 2009. Cash was used to fund the Groups operations including the OVATURE clinical trial program for the investigational anti-cancer drug phenoxodiol being undertaken by Novogens U.S. subsidiary Marshall Edwards, Inc. (MEI), and in connection with the termination of employment of the Companys CEO in December 2009 and additional redundancy costs associated with the management restructure in June 2010, which will result in future cash savings. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents in interest bearing facilities with various maturity dates. At the end of fiscal 2010, term deposits amounting to A$3.0 million had a weighted average interest rate of 5.40% and cash deposits at call of A$12.1 million had a weighted average interest rate of 0.66%. The Company has arranged a multi option facility with St George Bank Limited, an Australian commercial bank, of A$1.0 million, A$0.5 million of which was unused at the end of fiscal 2010. As of June 30, 2010, the Group did not hold derivative financial instruments in managing its foreign currency, however, the Company may from time to time enter into hedging arrangements where circumstances are deemed appropriate. The Company believes that its cash balances will provide sufficient cash resources to fund operations over the next twelve months. The Company will require additional funds in order complete the planned clinical development programs. In order to obtain additional funding the Company may need to rely on collaboration and /or licensing opportunities. The Company cannot assure you that it will be able to raise the funds necessary to complete the planned clinical trial programs, or find appropriate collaboration or licensing opportunities. The Company has historically financed its operations primarily from equity capital. On March 31, 2010, MEI effected a reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock on a 1-for-10 split adjusted basis in order to correct a bid price listing requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Market under Nasdaq Rule 5450(a)(1). For the purpose of this report we have adjusted all share data presented retrospectively to incorporate the 1-for-10 reverse stock split. On July 28, 2008 MEI entered into a securities subscription agreement with Oppenheimer Funds, Inc. and Novogen Limited pursuant to which MEI sold 170,000 and 290,829 shares of common stock to Oppenheimer and Novogen respectively, at a purchase price of US$21.70 per share. The aggregate proceeds to MEI from the sale of shares was US$10,000,000. The shares are registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. On 41 July 30,2008 MEI filed a Prospectus Supplement to the registration statement covering the sale of shares to Oppenheimer and Novogen. On July 29, 2008 the Company entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with El Coronado Holdings LLC for the placement of 4,531,633 ordinary shares at a purchase price of A$1.2215 per share raising gross proceeds of A$5,535,390. Following the placement El Coronado Holdings LLC holds 19.9% of the Companys issued and outstanding shares. There are no commitments for capital expenditure outstanding at the end of the financial year. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements Financial Instruments for disclosures about financial risk management including interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk. Research and Development Research and development policy Expenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when incurred. Development costs are capitalised only when technical feasibility studies identify that the project will deliver future economic benefits and these benefits can be measured reliably. Development costs have a finite life and are amortised on a systematic basis matched to the future economic benefits over the useful life of the project. The Company spent A$8.1 million, A$18.8 million and A$18.8 million on gross research and development expenditure during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively. Due to the nature and uncertainty of the research and development projects being undertaken by the Company, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost and timing of project completion. The costs of research and development projects are not estimated on a project by project basis. An analysis of costs between projects may only be performed on an arbitrary and subjective basis. The progress on research and development projects and expenses is monitored and controlled in a number of ways:  All third party research and development, including the conduct of clinical trials, are carried out under contract. The contract details include project milestones and expenditure budgets. Senior research and development staff monitor the projects to ensure that milestones are achieved in a timely manner.  In-house research and development is managed by senior research and development staff. Budgets are prepared annually and agreed upon by the Novogen 42 Board. Actual expenses incurred are monitored monthly against the budget by expense line and in total. Trend Information The Company expects to consume cash and incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company intends to continue its expenditure on the development of its oncology drug candidates. The impact on cash resources and results from operations will vary with the extent and timing of the future clinical trial program. It is not possible to make accurate predictions of future operating results. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Compensation Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration Remuneration philosophy Remuneration is assessed for Directors and senior executives with the overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality executive team. The appropriateness and nature of remuneration is assessed by reference to employment market conditions. The financial and non-financial objectives of the Company are also considered when assessing the remuneration of Directors and other key management personnel, however, Directors and other key management personnels annual remuneration has no variable performance bonus elements that are directly linked to Company financial performance with the exception of the CEO of Glycotex, Inc. (Refer to section Employment Agreements for details of performance bonus). The Board has established a Remuneration Committee which is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the key management personnel. Directors fees The Constitution of the Company and the ASX Listing Rules specify that the aggregate remuneration of Non-executive Directors shall be determined from time to time by General Meeting. The last determination for Novogen Limited was at the Annual General Meeting held on 28 October, 2005 when the shareholders approved an aggregate remuneration of $560,000. The total Non-executive Director remuneration of Novogen Limited for the year ended 30 June, 2010 utilised $212,000 (2009: $260,000) of this authorised amount. The amount of aggregate remuneration sought to be approved by shareholders and the manner in which it is apportioned amongst Directors is reviewed periodically. Non-executive Director remuneration Fees to Non-executive Directors reflect the demands which are made on, and the responsibilities of the Directors. Non-executive Directors fees are reviewed periodically by the Board. In conducting these reviews the Board considers independent remuneration surveys to ensure Non-executive Directors fees are appropriate and in line with the market. Each Non-executive Director receives a fee for being a Director of the Company. An additional fee is also paid for each Board committee on which a Director sits. The payment of additional fees for serving on a committee recognises the additional time commitment required by Non-executive Directors who serve on one or more committees. 47 Due to the impact of the global financial crisis and the need for the Company to conserve cash, the Companys Non-executive Directors voluntarily reduced Directors fees by 20% with effect from 1 February, 2009, this reduction was maintained for the year ended 30 June, 2010. Executive Directors and other key management personnel remuneration The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the key management personnel. The Remuneration Committee assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of remuneration of such Officers on a periodic basis by reference to relevant employment market conditions with the overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality executive team. Such officers are given the opportunity to receive their base remuneration, which is structured as a total employment cost package, in a variety of forms including cash and prescribed non-financial benefits. It is intended that the manner of payment chosen will be optimal for the recipient without creating undue cost for the Group. Due to the impact of the global financial crisis and the need for the Company to conserve cash, effective from 1 February, 2009, the Companys Executive Directors and key management personnel entered into an agreement to voluntarily reduce their working hours effecting a corresponding reduction of 20% in paid remuneration. This voluntary reduction ceased on 1 February, 2010, coinciding with the new employment agreements being signed with the Companys seven most senior executives. The new agreements bring all the Company executives termination payments into full compliance with the recent amendments to the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and with the ASX Listing Rules. 48 Employment Agreements Novogen Executive Directors and key management executives (standard contracts) It is the Remuneration Committee policy that employment contracts are entered into with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Research Director and each of the executives who are considered key management personnel. New contracts were entered into in March 2010. Under the terms of the agreement remuneration is reviewed annually and any increases may be made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Key management executives are given the opportunity to receive their base remuneration, which is structured as a total employment cost package, in a variety of forms including cash and prescribed non financial benefits. The employment agreements continue until terminated by either party by giving six months notice in accordance with the terms of their contract or in the case of the Company by making a payment in lieu of six months notice to the employee. In the event of the Company terminating without cause, under the terms of the contracts the amount payable on termination is a fixed dollar value for each key management personnel which at 30 June, 2010 is of an amount equal to 4.66 months remuneration, in addition to any amount payable in lieu of notice. In September 2010, an employment agreement was signed with the Chief Financial Officer. The employment agreement continues until terminated by either party by giving six months notice in accordance with the terms of their contract or in the case of the Company by making a payment in lieu of six months notice to the employee. In the event of the Company terminating without cause, under the terms of the contract the amount payable on termination is equal to 6 months remuneration, in addition to any amount payable in lieu of notice. The Company may terminate the contracts at any time without cause if serious misconduct has occurred. 49 Glycotex, Inc.  Chief Executive Officer The CEO of Glycotex, Inc. is employed under an employment agreement that commenced in December, 2005 and was subsequently amended in January, 2008.

In May, 2009, Dr Koenig was issued stock options under the terms of Glycotex, Incs 2007 Stock Option Plan amounting to 5% of the outstanding common stock of Glycotex, Inc.

The value of options for key management personnel, granted during the year ended 30 June, 2010 was A$857,000.

There is no Board policy in relation to staff members limiting their exposure to risk as options vest subject to service criteria, not performance criteria. 53 Fair values of options: The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants made on: Novogen 6 March, 31 October, 2009 2008 Exercise price 0.5256 1.06 Share price at grant date 0.51 0.95 Dividend yield 0 % 0 % Expected volatility 73 % 66 % Historical volatility 73 % 66 % Risk-free interest rate 3.61 % 4.76 % Expected life of option 5 years 4.3 years Option fair value 0.31 0.51 Marshall Edwards 18 June, 7 June, 23 April, 28 January, 30 July, 2010 2010 2010 2009 2008 Exercise price US$ 1.52 US$ 1.86 US$ 5.05 US$ 6.30 US$ 21.70 Share price at grant date US$ 1.52 US$ 1.86 US$ 5.05 US$ 6.30 US$ 21.30 Dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % Expected volatility 136 % 135 % 132 % 111 % 81 % Historical volatility 136 % 135 % 132 % 111 % 81 % Risk-free interest rate 2.04 % 1.95 % 2.61 % 1.70 % 3.36 % Expected life of warrant/option 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Warrant/option fair value US$ 1.33 US$ 1.63 US$ 4.38 US$ 5.00 US$ 14.10 Glycotex 29 May, 2009 Exercise price US$ 15.13 Share price at grant date US$ 15.13 Dividend yield 0 % Expected volatility 52 % Historical volatility 52 % Risk-free interest rate 2.34 % Expected life of warrant 5 years Warrant fair value US$ 7.13 The dividend yield reflects the assumption that the current dividend payout, which is zero, will continue with no anticipated increases. The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. 54 Further detail on the remuneration of Directors and Executives are also provided in Note 19 to the financial statements. Arrangements and Relationships There are no arrangements (other than standard employment remuneration arrangements) by which any Director or Executive Officer was appointed to his position. There are no family relationships between any of the Directors or Executive Officers.

Leppinus Director 2005 Retired October , 2010 A. J. Husband Executive Director 2006 Retired as a Director June 30, 2010 Term of Directors The Companys Constitution requires that at each Annual General Meeting of the Company, one third (or the number nearest to but not exceeding one third) of the 55 Directors, (excluding a Director who is the Managing Director, and a director appointed to fill a casual vacancy) must retire from office provided that no Director may retain office for more than 3 years without offering himself/herself for re-election even though such submission results in more than one third of the Directors retiring from office. The Board of Directors has the power to appoint any person to be a director either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director (up to a maximum of 10). Any Director so appointed may hold office only until the next Annual General Meeting when he or she shall be eligible for election by the Company shareholders. Board of Directors The Board of Directors of Novogen Limited is elected by and accountable to shareholders. The Board monitors and directs the business and is responsible for the corporate governance of the Company. The Managing Director, who is accountable to the Board, is responsible for managing the development of the Company consistent with the objective of enhancing long term shareholder value. The Board is comprised of five Directors all of whom are non-Executive Directors. In addition, the Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee. Structure of the Board of Directors The skills, expertise and experience relevant to the position of Director held by each Director in office at the date of this Annual Report is included in Item 6 beginning on page 44. Directors are considered to be independent when they are independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with, or could reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with, the exercise of their unfettered and independent judgement. In the context of Director independence, materiality is considered from both the Company and individual Director perspective. In determining whether a non-Executive Director is independent, he or she must not hold more than 5% of the Companys outstanding shares. Also, the following qualitative factors, among others, are considered:  whether the director has been employed as an Executive of the Company within the last three years;  whether the director has been a principal of a material professional advisor or consultant of the Company;  whether the director has a material contractual relationship with the Company;  whether the director has served on the Board of Directors for a period which could be perceived to interfere with his or her ability to act in the best interests of the Company; and 56  whether the director has any business interests which could be perceived to interfere with his or her ability to act in the best interests of the Company. In accordance with the definition of independence above, and the materiality thresholds set, the following Directors of Novogen Limited are considered to be independent: Name Position Philip A. Johnston Non-Executive Chairman  retired 18 October, 2010 Professor Paul J. Nestel AO Non-Executive Director  retired 29 October, 2010 Geoffrey M. Leppinus Non-Executive Director  retired 29 October, 2010 William D. Rueckert Non-Executive Director Peter R. White Non-Executive Director  appointed September, 2010 Ross Youngman Non-Executive Director  appointed September, 2010 Peter Scutt Non-Executive Director  appointed October, 2010 There are procedures in place, agreed upon by the Board of Directors, to enable Directors in the furtherance of their duties, to seek independent professional advice at the Companys expense. For additional details regarding appointments to the Board of Directors please refer to the Companys web site. Audit Committee The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, which operates under a charter approved by the Board. It is the Boards responsibility to ensure that an effective internal control framework exists within the Group. This includes internal controls to deal with both the effectiveness and efficiency of significant business processes, the safeguarding of assets, the maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability of financial information as well as non-financial considerations such as bench marking of operational key performance indicators. The Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of a framework of internal control and ethical standards for the management of the consolidated entity to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible for the hiring, termination and compensation of the independent auditors and approving any non-audit work performed by the auditors. The Audit Committee also provides the Board with additional assurance regarding the reliability of financial information for inclusion in the financial reports. All members of the Audit Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors. The members of the Audit Committee during the fiscal year 2010 were Mr. Geoffrey Leppinus (Chairman), Professor Paul J. Nestel, Mr. Philip A. Johnston and Mr. William D. Rueckert (appointed April 1, 2010). The members of the Audit Committee at the date of this report were Mr. William D. Rueckert (Chairman), Mr. Josiah T. Austin and Mr. Peter R. White. 57 Performance The performance of the Board of Directors and the key Executives is reviewed regularly against both measurable and qualitative indicators. The performance criteria against which Directors and Executives are assessed have regard to the financial and non-financial objectives of Novogen Limited. Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the Directors, the Managing Director, Executive Director and senior Executives. The Remuneration Committee assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of emoluments of such officers on a periodic basis by reference to relevant employment market conditions with the overall objective of ensuring maximum shareholder benefit from the retention of a high quality executive team. The members of the Remuneration Committee during the fiscal year 2010 were Mr. Philip A. Johnston (Chairman), Mr. Geoffrey Leppinus, Professor Paul J. Nestel, and Mr. William D.

Novogen is listed on the ASX and subject to Chapter 10 of the ASX listing rules which requires shareholder approval for an acquisition from or disposal to a related party (including a director) or substantial shareholder (who is entitled to at least 10% of the voting securities) of substantial assets.

Significant Changes After Balance Sheet Date Novogen Limited Novogen Limited received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market on 19 July, 2010 notifying it that for the last 30 consecutive business days the bid price of the Companys ADRs closed below the minimum US$1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Market under Nasdaq Rule 5450(a)(1). According to Nasdaqs letter, the Company will be afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until 18 January, 2011, to regain compliance in accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). In order to regain compliance, shares of the Companys ADRs must maintain a minimum bid closing price of at least US$1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the grace period. The Company intends to actively monitor the bid price of its common stock between now and 18 January, 2011 and take those steps possible to maintain a Nasdaq listing. This notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market has no bearing on the ASX listing. On 8 September, 2010, Novogen announced that it had reached agreement in principle with its subsidiary MEI to acquire Novogens entire isoflavone-related intellectual property portfolio in a stock-based transaction. The agreement in principle was negotiated by an independent subcommittee of the Board of Directors of both companies. The closing of the transaction is subject to, among other things, due 64 diligence, the execution of a definitive agreement, an independent fairness opinion and shareholder approvals. On 20 September, 2010, Novogen appointed three new directors; Mr Ross Youngman, Mr Peter White and Mr Josiah T Austin. Of the three Directors, two are based in the United States and one in Australia, with their backgrounds encompassing investment and corporate finance. On 18 October, 2010, Novogen appointed Mr William D Rueckert, a current non-executive Director, as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr Rueckert replaces Mr Philip Johnston, who resigned as both Chairman and a director. On 29 October, 2010, Novogen appointed Mr Peter Scutt, an Australian based corporate advisor, as a director of the Company, following the retirement of Prof. Paul Nestel and Mr Geoff Leppinus. On December 8, 2010, the Company received approval to transfer the listing of its ADRs from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Companys securities will be transferred to the Capital Market at the opening of business on December 20, 2010. The Companys research and development operations in Australia will cease on 31 December, 2010. Staff termination costs associated with this restructure will amount to approximately A$465,000. The Company may seek to sublet excess space following this decision as well as disposing of any plant and equipment no longer required. Marshall Edwards, Inc. On May 18, 2010 Novogens subsidiary MEI received a notice from Nasdaq indicating that the it failed to comply with the minimum stockholders equity requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(A) for continued listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market because our stockholders equity as of March 31, 2010 as set forth in MEIs quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2010 of US$9.16 million was below the US$10 million minimum stockholders equity requirement. The notice also stated MEI would be provided 45 calendar days, or until July 2, 2010, to submit a plan to regain compliance. MEI responded to Nasdaq on July 2, 2010. The response included plans to satisfy the listing requirements with respect to the maintaining a minimum US$10 million Shareholders equity value. MEI stated its intention to pursue a capital raising transaction within the time provided by Nasdaq rules if market conditions permit, to further fund development of our product candidates 1) triphendiol or its primary active metabolite NV-143, a potentially more potent, second generation analog of phenoxodiol; and 2) NV-128. In the alternative, MEI intends to apply to transfer the listing of its common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. 65 On August 5, 2010, MEI received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that, based on its plan, Nasdaq has determined to grant an extension, through November 15, 2010, to regain compliance with the Rule by establishing stockholders equity of at least US$10 million. On November 16, 2010, MEI was notified by the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market that, due to the Companys non-compliance with the minimum US$10 million stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in Listing Rule 5450(b)(1), MEIs common stock is subject to delisting unless it requests a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. MEI has requested a hearing before the Panel, which request will stay any further action by Nasdaq until the Panel issues its decision following the hearing. In connection with the hearing, the Panel may grant MEI an additional compliance period of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the Nasdaq staffs determination, or 16 May, 2011, to evidence compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. MEI has been granted a hearing date of 6 January, 2010. While MEI is working diligently to remedy the listing deficiency, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant MEIs request for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market and, if the Panel does not, MEIs common stock may be transferred to The Nasdaq Capital Market or delisted from Nasdaq. On 14 July, 2010, MEI received notice from Nasdaq stating that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Market Value of Publicly Held Shares closed below the minimum US$5 million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market under Nasdaq Rule 5450(b)(1)(C). Market Value of Publicly Held Shares is calculated by multiplying the publicly held shares, which is total shares outstanding less any shares held by officers, directors, or beneficial owners of 10% or more, by the consolidated closing bid price. Novogen Limited currently owns 71.3% of the outstanding common stock of MEI. Therefore, the value of Novogen Limiteds shares is excluded from the Market Value of Publicly Held Shares of MEI. According to Nasdaqs letter, MEI would be afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until 10 January, 2011, to regain compliance in accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). MEI intend to actively monitor the Market Value of Publicly Held Shares between now and 10 January, 2011. On 10 August, 2010 MEI announced the appointment of Christine A. White, M.D. to its board of directors. Dr. White replaced Professor Paul J. Nestel, who served as a director since April 2001. On September 8, 2010, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with MEI to sell Novogens entire isoflavone-related intellectual property portfolio in a stock-based transaction. The agreement in principle was negotiated by independent committees of the Board of Directors of both companies. The closing of the transaction is subject to, among other things, due diligence, the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, independent fairness opinions and shareholder approvals. The foregoing description of the agreement in principle between the MEI and Novogen does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale or a solicitation of offers to purchase securities. 66 There have been no other significant events occurring after balance sheet date which have had a material impact on the business. 67 Item 9.
