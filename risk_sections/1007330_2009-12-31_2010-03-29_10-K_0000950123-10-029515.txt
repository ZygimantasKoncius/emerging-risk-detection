ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Revenues from our accounts payable recovery audit business have declined over the last several years. We must successfully execute our recovery audit growth strategy in order to reverse this trend. Over time, our clients tend to resolve recurring transaction processing deficiencies. In addition, many of our clients have internal staffs that audit the transactions before we do. As the skills, experience and resources of our clients internal recovery audit staffs improve, they will identify many overpayments themselves and reduce some of our audit recovery opportunities. Based on these and other factors, including competitive rate pressures and loss of clients from time to time, without improved audit execution and acquisition of new clients, we believe that our accounts payable recovery audit business will continue to experience revenue declines. We depend on our largest clients for significant revenues, so losing a major client could adversely affect our revenues and liquidity. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from our largest clients. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our five largest clients accounted for approximately 29.9%, 30.4% and 32.6% of our revenues from continuing operations, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (and its affiliated companies) accounted for approximately 12.3% and 11.2% of our total revenues, respectively. If we lose any of our major clients, our results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. We have a history of losses and may not be able to sustain profitability. We reported a net loss from continuing operations of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and net losses of $21.1 million, $207.7 million, $71.5 million, and $160.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Despite reporting a profit from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we can make no assurance that our ongoing cost management efforts or our attempts to increase our revenues will be successful on a sustained basis. If we are not able to increase revenues and effectively manage our costs, we may not be able to sustain profitability in the future or generate sufficient cash to fund our operations and pay our indebtedness. Client and vendor bankruptcies and financial difficulties could reduce our earnings. Our clients generally operate in intensely competitive environments and, accordingly, bankruptcy filings by our clients are not uncommon. Bankruptcy filings by our large clients or the significant vendors who supply them or unexpectedly large vendor claim chargebacks lodged against one or more of our larger clients could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, our inability to collect our accounts receivable due to other financial difficulties of one or more of our large clients could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Recent economic conditions which have adversely impacted the U.S. retail industry may continue to negatively impact our revenues. Since we audit our clients purchases on an average of 12-18 months in arrears, we may not know the full impact of the recent economic downturn on our business and revenues until late 2010 or later. We expect that if the retail industry economic conditions continue to erode, it could continue to have a negative impact on our revenues. Specifically, client liquidity and the liquidity of client vendors can significantly impact claim production, the claim approval process, and the ability of clients to offset or otherwise make recoveries from their vendors. If a client files for bankruptcy, we could be subject to an action to recover certain payments received in the 90 days prior to the bankruptcy filing known as preference payments. If we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims, we would be required to make unbudgeted cash payments which could strain our financial liquidity and our earnings would be reduced. Our growth strategy may not be successful. As discussed in Item 1 The PRGX Strategy, our objective is to build on our position as the leading worldwide provider of recovery audit services and to develop and grow our business analytics and advisory services businesses. 12 Table of Contents Our strategic plan to achieve these objectives focuses on a series of initiatives designed to maintain our dedicated focus on clients and rekindle our growth. We are executing a number of initiatives that are designed to implement our strategy. These initiatives are ongoing and the results of the strategy and implementation will not be known until sometime in the future. Each of the initiatives requires sustained management focus, organization and coordination over time, as well as success in building relationships with third parties. If we are unable to implement our strategy successfully, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, implementation of our strategy will require material investments and cost increases which may not yield incremental revenues and improved financial performance as planned. We have incurred significant costs in establishing the necessary resources to provide services for Medicare audit recovery work and we will continue to incur significant costs as a subcontractor in the national RAC program. Furthermore, revenues from our Medicare audit recovery work lag significantly behind these costs and may not justify the costs incurred. We have expended substantial resources in connection with preparing for and providing Medicare audit services under CMSs RAC program. While our participation in the RAC demonstration project made an important contribution to our revenues in 2006 and 2007, the RAC demonstration project contract expired on March 27, 2008. We continue to incur significant costs relating to our participation as a subcontractor in the national RAC program. We incurred an operating loss of approximately $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 in connection with our RAC subcontractor program work. In addition, as a result of the complex regulations governing Medicare payments and recoupments, including a multi-layered scheme for provider appeals of overpayment determinations, the terms of the Companys Medicare audit subcontracts and the complexity of Medicare data, systems and processes, generally, it is more difficult and takes longer to achieve recoveries than in other areas of our recovery audit business. Recovery auditing of Medicare spending is subject to a number of pressures and uncertainties that could impact our future opportunities and revenues from this business. As contrasted with recovery auditing for our retail/wholesale and commercial clients, recovery auditing of Medicare spending is a legislatively mandated program subject to, among other things, the efforts of healthcare providers and provider associations, including political pressures, to end or severely limit the CMS recovery audit program. These efforts and political pressures are expected to be ongoing throughout the life of the CMS recovery audit program and during 2007, for example, resulted in a number of significant developments. In October 2007, CMS implemented a temporary pause in our review under the RAC demonstration program of certain payments made to rehabilitation hospitals. Further, on November 8, 2007, legislation was introduced in Congress proposing a one year halt to CMSs recovery audit program and calling for an assessment of the program by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Although the referenced legislation was not passed, and the national CMS RAC program is underway, similar legislative efforts to delay or eliminate the program could emerge at any time and management is unable to assess the prospects for the success of any such legislation. Furthermore, efforts by healthcare providers and provider associations to limit or end the program are expected to be ongoing. If CMSs recovery audit program is significantly limited or delayed, subjected to burdensome or commercially challenging requirements, terms and/or conditions, or altogether terminated, our future revenues, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. Our participation in the national Medicare recovery audit program is as a subcontractor, and consequently, is subject to being reduced or eliminated should the prime contractors with whom we have contracted have their prime contracts with CMS terminated or should those contracts expire. Under CMSs national recovery audit contractor program, we will be participating as a subcontractor in three of the national RAC programs four geographic regions. Accordingly, we have entered into three separate contracts with the prime contractors and are not directly contracting with CMS. Under these circumstances, we generally bear the risk that the prime contractors will not meet their performance obligations to CMS under the prime contract, that the prime contractors will not pay us amounts due under the subcontracts and that the prime contractors will seek to minimize our role in RAC program. The failure of a prime contractor to perform its obligations to CMS could result in the termination of such contract with CMS which would, in turn, result in the termination of our subcontract. Additionally, CMS could choose to not exercise its option to extend its contract with any of the prime contractors at the end of any one-year term, which would also, in turn, result in our subcontract with that prime contractor 13 Table of Contents expiring. The termination or expiration of these subcontracts or the failure of the prime contractors to make required payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to protect and maintain the competitive advantage of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights. Our operations could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to protect our proprietary software, audit techniques and methodologies, and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. Although we presently hold U.S. and foreign registered trademarks and U.S. registered copyrights on certain of our proprietary technology, we may be unable to obtain similar protection on our other intellectual property. In addition, our foreign registered trademarks may not receive the same enforcement protection as our U.S. registered trademarks. Additionally, to protect our confidential and trade secret information, we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, clients and potential clients. We also limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. Nevertheless, we may be unable to deter misappropriation or unauthorized dissemination of our proprietary information, detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Even though we take care to protect our own intellectual property, there is no guarantee that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. Moreover, although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, we are also subject to the risk that someone else will assert a claim against us in the future for violating their intellectual property rights. Security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, damaging our reputation or exposing us to liability. We receive, process, store and transmit our clients confidential data electronically. Unauthorized access to our computer systems or stored data could result in the theft or disclosure of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could cause interruptions in our operations. These security risks increase when we transmit information over the Internet or other electronic networks. Despite implemented security measures, computer viruses from electronic networks or in physical media could infiltrate our systems and disrupt our delivery of services or expose our clients confidential information. A security breach or computer virus could have a negative impact on our reputation, could expose us to liability to our clients, third parties or government authorities and could cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Operational failures in our data processing facilities could harm our business and reputation. An interruption of data processing services caused by damage or destruction of our facilities or a failure of our data processing equipment could result in a loss of clients, difficulties in obtaining new clients and a reduction in revenue. In addition, we may also be liable to third parties or our clients because of such interruption. These risks increase with longer service interruptions. Despite any disaster recovery and business continuity plans and precautions we have implemented (including insurance) to protect against the effects of service delivery interruptions, such interruptions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to retain the services of key members of management and highly skilled personnel could adversely impact our operations and financial performance. Our future success depends largely on the efforts and skills of our executive officers and key employees. As such, we have entered into employment agreements with key members of management. While these employment agreements limit the ability of key employees to directly compete with us in the future, nothing prevents them from leaving our company. In addition, it is especially challenging to attract and retain highly qualified skilled auditors and other professionals in an industry where competition for skilled personnel is intense. Accordingly, our future performance also depends, in part, on the ability of our management team to work together effectively, manage our workforce, 14 Table of Contents and retain highly qualified personnel. We rely on operations outside the U.S. for a significant portion of our revenues. Approximately 45.8% and 42.8% of our revenues from continuing operations were generated from operations outside the U.S. in 2009 and 2008, respectively. These international operations are subject to numerous risks, including:  political and economic instability in the international markets we serve;  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and in collecting accounts receivable;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly weaknesses in the British pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, and the Brazilian real and other currencies of countries in which we transact business, which could result in currency translations that materially reduce our revenues and earnings;  costs associated with adapting our services to our foreign clients needs;  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws;  expenses and legal restrictions associated with transferring earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to us;  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices;  business interruptions due to widespread disease, potential terrorist activities, or other catastrophes;  reduced or limited protection of our intellectual property rights; and  longer accounts receivable cycles. Because we expect a significant portion of our revenues to continue to come from operations outside the U.S., the occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our revenues from providing accounts payable recovery audit services to commercial clients have been declining. The service model for commercial clients is generally different from that for retailers. The substantial majority of our domestic commercial accounts payable recovery audit clients are served using a disbursement audit service model which entails obtaining limited data from the client and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories. Historically, services to these types of clients have tended to be either periodic (typically, every two to three years) or rotational in nature with different divisions of a given client being audited in pre-arranged periodic sequences. Accordingly, revenues derived from a given commercial client may change markedly from year to year. Additionally, the duration of a disbursement audit is often measured in weeks or months, as opposed to years, and the number of auditors assigned per client is usually between one and five. We will need to successfully execute our strategies to lower our cost to serve commercial recovery audit clients, broaden the number of profitably served recovery audit clients and grow our other lines of business in order to stabilize and increase our revenues to replace declining revenues from this business. Our recovery audit services, business analytics and advisory services businesses operate in highly competitive environments and are subject to pricing pressure. The recovery audit business is highly competitive, with numerous other recovery audit firms and other providers of recovery audit services, and with many clients having developed their own internal audit capabilities. As a result of competition among the providers of recovery audit services and the availability of certain audit services from clients internal audit departments, our recovery audit services business is subject to intense price pressure. Such price pressure could cause our profit margins to decline and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business analytics and advisory services businesses also have numerous competitors varying in size, market strength and specialization. These businesses face competition, in some cases, from firms who have established and well known franchises and brands. Frequently, these businesses must compete not only on service quality and expertise, but also on price. Intense price competition faced by these service lines could negatively impact our profit margins and have a potential adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 15 Table of Contents Generally our client contracts contain provisions under which the client may terminate the agreement prior to the completion of the agreement. Many of our client contracts contain provisions that would permit the client to terminate the contract without cause prior to the completion of the term of the agreement by providing us with relatively short prior written notice of the termination. As a result, the existence of contractual relationships with our clients is not an assurance that we will continue to provide services for our clients through the entire terms of their respective agreements. If clients representing a significant portion of our revenues terminated their agreements unexpectedly, we may not, in the short-term, be able to replace the revenues and earnings from such contracts and this would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, client contract terminations could also harm our reputation within the industry which could negatively impact our ability to obtain new clients. Our failure to comply with applicable governmental privacy laws and regulations could substantially impact our business, operations and financial condition. We are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and foreign privacy laws and regulations. Changes in privacy laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could have a substantial effect on our operating methods and costs. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in the termination or loss of contracts, the imposition of contractual damages, civil sanctions, damage to the Companys reputation, or in certain circumstances, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. Determining compliance with such regulations is complicated by the fact that many of these laws and regulations have not been fully interpreted by governing regulatory authorities or the courts and many of the provisions of such laws and regulations are open to a wide range of interpretations. There can be no assurance that we are or have been in compliance with all applicable existing laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with new laws or regulations. The ownership change that occurred as a result of our 2006 exchange offer limits our ability to use our net operating losses. We have substantial tax loss and credit carry-forwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On March 17, 2006, as a result of the closing of its exchange offer, the Company experienced an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). This ownership change resulted in an annual IRC Section 382 limitation that limits the use of certain tax attribute carry-forwards. Of the $47.4 million of U.S. federal net loss carry-forwards available to the Company, $21.9 million of the loss carry-forwards are subject to an annual usage limitation of $1.4 million. We believe that such limitations and the loss of these carry-forwards may significantly increase our projected future tax liability. Certain of our tax positions may be subject to challenge by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and if successful, these challenges could increase our future tax liabilities and expense. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as local country tax purposes in the jurisdictions where we operate, from time to time we take positions under provisions of applicable tax law that are subject to varying interpretations. Certain of our tax positions may be subject to challenge by the applicable taxing authorities, including, in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service. If our tax positions are successfully challenged, our future tax liabilities and expense could significantly increase. For example, during 2008, the Company acceded to a position taken by the taxing authorities in the United Kingdom (UK) regarding the denial of certain goodwill deductions taken on UK tax returns for 2003 through 2005. As a result, foreign net operating loss carry-forwards were reduced by approximately $17.0 million based on December 31, 2008 foreign exchange rates. Accordingly, deferred tax assets of $5.1 million were written off. While we believe that our tax positions are proper based on applicable law and we believe that it is more likely than not that we would prevail with respect to challenges to these positions, we can make no assurances that we would prevail if our positions are challenged or that business economics would justify the mounting of a legal defense against such challenges. If our tax positions are successfully challenged by the U.S. or non-U.S. taxing authorities, it could increase our future tax liabilities and expense and have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 16 Table of Contents Future impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets would reduce our future earnings. As of December 31, 2009, the Companys goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $28.7 million. We must perform annual assessments to determine whether some portion, or all, of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-term assets are impaired. Future annual impairment testing under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (FASB ASC 350) could result in a determination that our goodwill or other intangible assets have been impaired, and future annual impairment testing under FASB ASC 350 could result in a determination that our long-lived assets have been impaired. Adverse future changes in the business environment or in our ability to perform audits successfully and compete effectively in our market or the discontinuation of our use of certain of our intangible or other long-lived assets could result in impairment which could materially adversely impact future earnings. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, shareholder rights plan and Georgia law may inhibit a change of control that shareholders may favor. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders receive attractive offers for their shares or if a substantial number, or even a majority, of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions that could delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following:  a classified Board of Directors;  the requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause;  specified requirements for calling special meetings of shareholders; and  the ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests of various constituencies, including our employees, clients and creditors and the local community, in making decisions. Our articles of incorporation also permit the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock with such designations, powers, preferences and rights as it determines, without any further vote or action by our shareholders. In addition, we have in place a poison pill shareholders rights plan that could trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon substantial purchases of our common stock by a third party that are not approved by the Board of Directors. These provisions also could discourage bids for our shares of common stock at a premium and have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The terms of our credit facility place restrictions on us, which create risks of default and reduce our flexibility. Our current credit facility (see New Credit Facility included in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information regarding our new credit facility) contains a number of affirmative, negative, and financial covenants which limit our ability to take certain actions and require us to comply with specified financial ratios and other performance covenants. No assurance can be provided that we will not violate the covenants of our secured credit facility in the future. If we are unable to comply with our financial covenants in the future, our lenders could pursue their contractual remedies under the credit facility, including requiring the immediate repayment in full of all amounts outstanding, if any. Additionally, we cannot be certain that, if the lenders demanded immediate repayment of any amounts outstanding, we would be able to secure adequate or timely replacement financing on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to make payments due on our debt will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which we cannot control. If the cash flow from our operating activities is insufficient, we may take actions such as delaying or reducing capital expenditures, attempting to restructure or refinance our debt, selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital. Some or all of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations and we could be required to file for bankruptcy. Further, we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our credit agreements may limit our ability to take several of these actions. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. 17 Table of Contents Our common stock is currently traded on The Nasdaq Global Market. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2009, our stock traded as high as $6.98 per share and as low as $2.48 per share. Our stock price may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including:  future announcements concerning us, key clients or competitors;  quarterly variations in operating results and liquidity;  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;  developments with respect to technology or litigation;  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to our company;  acquisitions and financings; and  sales and purchases of blocks of stock by insiders. Fluctuations in the stock market, generally, also impact the volatility of our stock price. Finally, general economic conditions and stock market movements may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
