Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our BusinessSUSS is our largest customer, and we are dependent on SUSS for a significant majority of our revenues. Therefore, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of SUSS. If SUSS changes its business strategy, is unable to satisfy its obligations under our various commercial agreements for any reason, or significantly reduces the volume of motor fuel it purchases under the SUSS Distribution Contract, our revenues will decline and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders will be adversely affected.For the year ended December 31, 2012, SUSS would have accounted for approximately 65% of our revenues, 50% of our gross profit and 65% of our motor fuel volumes sold, had our initial public offering, related contribution transactions and entry into commercial contracts with SUSS occurred on January 1, 2012. As we expect to continue to derive a significant percentage of our revenues from SUSS for the foreseeable future, we are subject to the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance by SUSS under the SUSS Distribution Contract. Furthermore, the SUSS Distribution Contract does not impose any minimum volume obligations on SUSS and SUSS will have a limited ability to remove Stripes® convenience stores from the SUSS Distribution Contract. If SUSS changes its business strategy or significantly reduces the volume of motor fuel it purchases for its Stripes® convenience stores and independently operated consignment locations, our cash flows will be adversely impacted. Any event, whether in our areas of operation or otherwise, that materially and adversely affects SUSS' financial condition, results of operation or cash flows may adversely affect our ability to sustain or increase cash distributions to our unitholders. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the operational and business risks of SUSS, some which are related to the following:•competitive pressures from convenience stores, gasoline stations, and non-traditional fuel retailers such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants located in SUSS' markets;•volatility in prices for motor fuel, which could adversely impact consumer demand for motor fuel;•increasing consumer preferences for alternative motor fuels, or improvements in fuel efficiency;•seasonal trends in the convenience store industry, which significantly impact SUSS' motor fuel sales;•the impact of severe or unfavorable weather conditions on SUSS' facilities or communications networks, or on consumer behavior, travel and convenience store traffic patterns;•cross‑border risks associated with the concentration of SUSS' stores in markets bordering Mexico;8•SUSS' dependence on information technology systems;•SUSS' ability to build or acquire and successfully integrate new stores;•the operation of SUSS' retail stores in close proximity to stores of our other customers; and•risks relating to SUSS' substantial indebtedness and its dependence on us for cash flow generation.Finally, we have no control over SUSS, our largest source of revenue and our primary customer. SUSS may elect to pursue a business strategy that does not favor us and our business. SUSS owns and controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our general partner and its affiliates, including SUSS, have conflicts of interest with us and limited fiduciary duties and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders.We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner, to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution to our unitholders.We may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay the full amount of our minimum quarterly distribution of $0.4375 per unit, or $1.75 per unit per year, which will require us to have available cash of approximately $9.6 million per quarter, or $38.3 million per year, based on the number of common and subordinated units currently outstanding. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common and subordinated units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:•demand for motor fuel in the markets we serve, including seasonal fluctuations in demand for motor fuel;•competition from other companies that sell motor fuel products in our market areas;•regulatory action affecting the supply of or demand for motor fuel, our operations, our existing contracts or our operating costs;•prevailing economic conditions; and•volatility of prices for motor fuel.In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors including:•the level and timing of capital expenditures we make;•the cost of acquisitions, if any;•our debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in our working capital needs;•reimbursements made to our general partner and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses they incur on our behalf pursuant to the partnership agreement;•our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in debt agreements to which we are a party; and•the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner.9The growth of our wholesale business depends in part on SUSS' ability to construct, open and profitably operate new Stripes® convenience stores. If SUSS does not construct additional Stripes® convenience stores, our growth strategy and ability to increase cash distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected.A significant part of our growth strategy is to increase our wholesale fuel distribution volumes and rental income relating to newly constructed Stripes® convenience stores. SUSS may not be able to construct and open new convenience stores, and any new stores that SUSS opens may be unprofitable or fail to attract expected volumes of motor fuel sales. Several factors that could affect SUSS' ability to open and profitably operate new stores include:•competition in targeted market areas;•the inability to identify and acquire suitable sites for new stores or to negotiate acceptable leases for such sites;•difficulties in adapting distribution and other operational and management systems to an expanded network of stores;•the potential inability to obtain adequate financing to fund its expansion; and•difficulties in obtaining governmental and other third‑party consents, permits and licenses needed to construct and operate additional stores.Furthermore, SUSS is not obligated to construct additional Stripes® convenience stores nor enter into additional sale and leaseback transactions with respect to any newly constructed stores beyond the 75 option stores under the Omnibus Agreement. Additionally, under the SUSS Distribution Contract, SUSS will continue to have the right to convert a limited number of stores each year to third‑party consignment contracts, and the third‑party wholesalers party to such consignment contracts would not be obligated to purchase any motor fuel from us. If SUSS were to determine in the future that growth via the construction of additional Stripes® convenience stores or additional sale and leaseback transactions is not attractive or that it is more advantageous to contract for third‑party consignment sales of motor fuel at existing or future locations as opposed to SUSS selling the motor fuel, it could adversely impact our ability to grow our motor fuel volumes and rental income and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected.A substantial majority of our revenues are generated under contracts that must be renegotiated or replaced periodically. If we are unable to successfully renegotiate or replace these contracts, then our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.For the year ended December 31, 2012, on a pro forma basis, SUSS would have accounted for approximately 65% of our revenues, 50% of our gross profit and 65% of our motor fuel volumes sold. The SUSS Distribution Contract has (i) a term of ten years from the IPO with respect to sales of motor fuel to existing Stripes® convenience stores and consignment locations, and (ii) a term of ten years from the applicable option store closing date with respect to any Stripes® convenience stores we purchase and lease back to SUSS pursuant to the 75 store option. However, SUSS is under no obligation to renew these volumes under the SUSS Distribution Contract on similar terms or at all, and SUSS' failure to renew the SUSS Distribution Contract would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, SUSS' obligation under the Omnibus Agreement to purchase any fuel it sells in the future for its own account will expire after ten years.Our third‑party revenues are generated under contracts with specified term lengths. As these contracts expire, they must be renegotiated or replaced. Our existing third‑party dealer distribution contracts generally have an initial term of ten years and currently have an average remaining term of approximately five years. These dealers have no obligation to renew their distribution contracts with us on similar terms or at all.We receive rental income from 55 properties that we currently lease or sublease to third parties, and eight Stripes® locations. Our lessees have no obligation to renew their contracts. Our third‑party rental contracts typically have an initial term of five to ten years, and, as of December 31, 2012, had an average remaining life of seven years.We may be unable to renegotiate or replace our third‑party distribution contracts or leases when they expire, and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the terms of the contracts they replace. Whether these contracts are successfully renegotiated or replaced is frequently subject to factors beyond our control. Such factors include fluctuations in motor fuel prices, counterparty ability to pay for or accept the contracted volumes and a competitive marketplace for the services offered by us. If we cannot successfully renegotiate or replace our third‑party contracts or must renegotiate or replace 10them on less favorable terms, revenues from these arrangements could decline and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected.Our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by changes in the prices of motor fuel, which may adversely impact our margins, our customers' financial condition and the availability of trade credit.Our operating results are influenced by prices for motor fuel, pricing volatility and the market for such products. When prices for motor fuel rise, some of our customers may have insufficient credit to purchase motor fuel from us at their historical volumes. In addition, significant and persistent increases in the retail price of motor fuel could also diminish consumer demand, which could subsequently diminish the volume of motor fuel we distribute. Furthermore, higher prices for motor fuel may reduce our access to trade credit support or cause it to become more expensive. On the other hand, significant decreases in wholesale motor fuel prices could result in lower motor fuel gross margins per gallon due to the reduction in value of discounts from our suppliers.A significant decrease in demand for motor fuel in the areas we serve would reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.A significant decrease in demand for motor fuel in the areas that we serve could significantly reduce our revenues and, therefore, reduce our ability to make or increase distributions to our unitholders. Our revenues are dependent on various trends, such as trends in commercial truck traffic, travel and tourism in our areas of operation, and these trends can change. Furthermore, seasonal fluctuations or regulatory action, including government imposed fuel efficiency standards, may affect demand for motor fuel. Because certain of our operating costs and expenses are fixed and do not vary with the volumes of motor fuel we distribute, our costs and expenses might not decrease ratably or at all should we experience a reduction in our volumes distributed. As a result, we may experience declines in our profit margin if our fuel distribution volumes decrease.Certain of our contracts with suppliers currently have early payment and volume‑related discounts which reduce the price we pay for motor fuel that we purchase from them. If we are unable to renew these contracts on similar terms, our gross profit will correspondingly decrease.Certain of our contracts with suppliers currently have early payment and volume‑related discounts based on the timing of our payment and the market price of the fuel and volumes that we purchase. During the year ended December 31, 2012, on a pro forma basis, we would have received early payment and volume‑related discounts on approximately 44% of all motor fuel volumes purchased. If we were to be unable to qualify for these discounts, or unable to renew these contracts on similar terms, our gross profit would decrease, which could, in turn, reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We currently depend on two principal suppliers for the majority of our motor fuel. A failure by a principal supplier to renew our supply agreement, a disruption in supply or an unexpected change in our supplier relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business.For fiscal 2012, Valero supplied approximately 35% and Chevron supplied approximately 20% of our consolidated motor fuel purchases. Our supply agreement with Valero expires in July 2018 and our supply agreement with Chevron expires in August 2014. If Valero or Chevron elects not to renew their contracts with us, we may be unable to replace the volume of motor fuel we currently purchase from them on similar terms or at all. Furthermore, a disruption in supply or a significant change in our relationship with our principal fuel suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We are exposed to performance risk in our supply chain. If our suppliers are unable to sell to us sufficient amounts of motor fuel products, we may be unable to satisfy our customers' demand for motor fuel.We rely upon our suppliers to timely provide the volumes and types of motor fuels for which they contract with us. We purchase motor fuels from a variety of suppliers under term contracts. Generally, our supply contracts do not guarantee that we will receive all of the volumes that we need to fulfill the demands of our distribution customers. In times of extreme market demand or supply disruption, we may be unable to acquire enough fuel to satisfy the fuel demand of our customers. Furthermore, the feedstock for a significant portion of our supply comes from other countries, which could be disrupted by political events. In the event that such feedstock becomes scarce, whether as a result of political events or otherwise, we may be unable to meet our customers' demand for motor fuel.11Increasing consumer preferences for alternative motor fuels, or improvements in fuel efficiency, could adversely impact our business.Any technological advancements, regulatory changes or changes in consumer preferences causing a significant shift toward alternative motor fuels, or non-fuel dependent means of transportation, could reduce demand for conventional petroleum based motor fuels. Additionally, a shift toward electric, hydrogen, natural gas or other alternative or non-fuel-powered vehicles could fundamentally change consumers' spending habits or lead to new forms of fueling destinations or new competitive pressures. Finally, new technologies have been developed and governmental mandates have been implemented to improve fuel efficiency. Any of these outcomes could potentially result in decreased consumer demand for motor fuel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.The wholesale motor fuel distribution industry is characterized by intense competition and fragmentation, and our failure to effectively compete could result in lower margins.The market for distribution of wholesale motor fuel is highly competitive and fragmented, which results in narrow margins. We have numerous competitors, some of which may have significantly greater resources and name recognition than us. We rely on our ability to provide value‑added, reliable services and to control our operating costs in order to maintain our margins and competitive position. If we were to fail to maintain the quality of our services, certain of our customers could choose alternative distribution sources and our margins could decrease. While major integrated oil companies have generally continued to divest retail sites and the corresponding wholesale distribution to such sites, such major oil companies could shift from this strategy and decide to distribute their own products in direct competition with us, or large customers could attempt to buy directly from the major oil companies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.The motor fuel business is subject to seasonal trends, which may affect our earnings and ability to make distributions.Our customers experience more demand for motor fuel during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel, recreation and construction activities typically increase in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for motor fuel. Therefore, the volume of motor fuel that we distribute is typically somewhat higher in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our results from operations may vary from period to period, affecting our earnings and ability to make cash distributions.Severe weather could adversely affect our business by damaging our suppliers or our customers' facilities or communications networks.A substantial portion of our wholesale distribution network is located on the Texas gulf coast. Although South Texas is generally known for its mild weather, the region is susceptible to severe storms, including hurricanes. A severe storm could damage our facilities or communications networks, or those of our suppliers or our customers, as well as interfere with our ability to distribute motor fuel to our customers or our customers' ability to operate their locations. If warmer temperatures, or other climate changes, lead to changes in extreme weather events, including increased frequency, duration or severity, these weather‑related risks could become more pronounced. Any weather‑related catastrophe or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, potentially causing losses beyond the limits of the insurance we currently carry.Negative events or developments associated with our branded suppliers could have an adverse impact on our revenues.We believe that the success of our operations is dependent, in part, on the continuing favorable reputation, market value and name recognition associated with the motor fuel brands sold both at Stripes® convenience stores and to independent, branded dealers. Erosion of the value of those brands could have an adverse impact on the volumes of motor fuel we distribute, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.12If we cannot otherwise agree with SUSS on fuel supply terms for volumes we sell to SUSS in the future (other than for stores purchased by us pursuant to our sale and leaseback option), then we will be required to supply volumes at a price equal to our motor fuel cost plus the alternate fuel sales rate, which will be substantially less than the fixed profit margin of three cents per gallon we will receive for motor fuel sold pursuant to the SUSS Distribution Contract. Furthermore, if certain of our operating costs increase significantly, we may not realize our anticipated profit margin with regard to motor fuel distributed to SUSS at the alternate fuel sales rate.Our Omnibus Agreement provides that if we cannot agree with SUSS on fuel supply terms for volumes we sell to SUSS in the future (other than for stores purchased by us pursuant to our sale and leaseback option), we will be required to distribute motor fuel to SUSS' newly built, acquired or added retail stores or consignment locations at a price equal to our motor fuel cost plus the alternate fuel sales rate, which will be substantially less than the fixed profit margin of three cents we receive for motor fuel sold pursuant to the SUSS Distribution Contract. The alternate fuel sales rate is a per gallon fee we will receive equal to our prior year per‑gallon motor fuel distribution costs, excluding the cost of the motor fuel, plus 30% of such costs. Our motor fuel distribution costs include direct distribution expenses as well as general and administrative expenses, maintenance capital expenditures, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous costs. Under the Omnibus Agreement, the alternate fuel sales rate will reset annually, but the fixed fee included in the rate for a given year will be based on our motor fuel distribution costs for the immediately preceding year.Accordingly, even though the alternate fuel sales rate will reset annually, we may not realize our anticipated profit margin on motor fuel distributed to SUSS at the alternate fuel sales rate. If our operating costs significantly increase in a given year as compared to immediately preceding year operating costs, the profit margin we receive for fuel distributed at the alternate fuel sales rate will be reduced, which will negatively impact our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Due to our lack of geographic diversification, adverse developments in our operating areas could adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Our operations are located in Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana and Oklahoma. Due to our lack of geographic diversification, an adverse development in the areas in which we operate, such as a catastrophic weather event or a decrease in demand for motor fuel, could have a significantly greater impact on our results of operations and cash available for distribution than it would if we operated in more diverse locations.If we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth may be limited.Our ability to grow depends substantially on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in available cash per unit. We intend to expand our dealer distribution network through acquisitions, and we anticipate that we may jointly pursue mutually beneficial acquisition opportunities with SUSS. However, we may be unable to take advantage of accretive opportunities for any of the following reasons:•we are unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or negotiate acceptable terms;•we are unable to reach an agreement with SUSS regarding the terms of jointly pursued acquisitions;•we are unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or•we are outbid by competitors.Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, we have a three-year option to purchase up to 75 new or recently constructed Stripes® convenience stores from SUSS and lease them back to SUSS on specified terms set forth in a lease agreement, including a specified lease rate, for an initial term of 15 years. However, such specified terms may not be economically favorable to us in the future, and we may not choose to exercise this option.In addition, we expect to grow through additional sale and leaseback transactions with SUSS beyond the 75 store option set forth in the Omnibus Agreement. However, SUSS is under no obligation to pursue acquisitions with us, enter into additional sale and leaseback arrangements with us beyond the 75 store option or generally pursue projects that enhance the value of our business. Finally, we may complete acquisitions which at the time of completion we believe will be accretive, but which ultimately may not be accretive. If any of these events were to occur, our future growth would be limited.13Any acquisitions we complete are subject to substantial risks that could reduce our ability to make distributions to unitholders.Even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase available cash per unit, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in available cash per unit. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:•we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and financial improvements we anticipate or acquired assets may not perform as we expect;•we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;•we may fail or be unable to discover some of the liabilities of businesses that we acquire, including liabilities resulting from a prior owner's noncompliance with applicable federal, state or local laws;•acquisitions may divert the attention of our senior management from focusing on our core business;•we may experience a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions; and•we face the risk that our existing financial controls, information systems, management resources and human resources will need to grow to support future growth.Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection and operational safety that may require significant expenditures or result in liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to underground storage tanks, the release or discharge of regulated materials into the air, water and soil, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the exposure of persons to regulated materials. A violation of, liability under or compliance with these laws or regulations or any future environmental laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Where releases of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels and crude oil have occurred, federal and state laws and regulations require that contamination caused by such releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contamination, as well as any associated third‑party claims, could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.New, stricter environmental laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The trend in environmental regulation is towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Our business may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. However, there can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the product quality specifications of the refined petroleum products we purchase, store, transport and sell to our distribution customers.Various federal, state and local government agencies have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications for certain commodities, including commodities that we distribute. Changes in product quality specifications, such as reduced sulfur content in refined petroleum products, or other more stringent requirements for fuels, could reduce our ability to procure product, require us to incur additional handling costs and/or require the expenditure of capital. If we are unable to procure product or recover these costs through increased sales, we may not be able to meet our financial obligations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial penalties.14The dangers inherent in the storage of motor fuel could cause disruptions in our operations and could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities.We store motor fuel in underground and above ground storage tanks. Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in storing motor fuel. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, spills, discharges and other releases, any of which could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, governmentally‑imposed fines or clean-up obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the properties of others. Any such event could significantly disrupt our operations or expose us to significant liabilities, to the extent such liabilities are not covered by insurance. Therefore, the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business.We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business. We may be unable to obtain or maintain insurance with the coverage that we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, the premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and could continue to do so. Certain insurance coverage could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.Future litigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are occasionally exposed to various litigation claims in the ordinary course of our business, including dealer litigation and industry-wide or class‑action claims arising from the equipment or processes we use or employ or industry‑specific business practices. If we were to become subject to any such claims in the future, our defense costs and any resulting awards or settlement amounts may not be fully covered by our insurance policies. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of any future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We rely on SUSS for transportation of all of our motor fuel, which in turn relies, in part, on third‑party transportation providers. As a result, a change in SUSS' transportation providers, a significant change in SUSS' relationship with its transportation providers or nonperformance or a disruption of motor fuel transportation services by SUSS or by SUSS' transportation providers could have a material adverse effect on our business.SUSS transports all of our motor fuel from terminals to its Stripes® convenience stores and consignment locations, and to our third‑party dealers and other customers pursuant to the SUSS Transportation Contract. SUSS transports a portion of our motor fuel itself and has contracts with third‑party transportation carriers for the remainder of our motor fuel. SUSS' third‑party contracts with its transportation providers may be terminated by either party upon 30 days' notice. A change in transportation providers, a significant change in SUSS' relationship with its transportation providers or nonperformance or a disruption in service by SUSS or by SUSS' transportation providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash available for distribution.We rely on our suppliers to provide trade credit terms to adequately fund our ongoing operations.Our business is impacted by the availability of trade credit to fund fuel purchases. An actual or perceived downgrade in our liquidity or operations (including any credit rating downgrade by a rating agency) could cause our suppliers to seek credit support in the form of additional collateral, limit the extension of trade credit, or otherwise materially modify their payment terms. Any material changes in our payments terms, including early payment discounts, or availability of trade credit provided by our principal suppliers could impact our liquidity, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Because we depend on our senior management's experience and knowledge of our industry, we could be adversely affected were we to lose key members of our senior management team.We are dependent on the expertise and continued efforts of our general partner's senior management team. If, for any reason, our senior executives do not continue to be active in our management, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, other than the key man life insurance for Sam L. Susser held by SUSS, our general partner does not maintain key man life insurance on its senior executives and other key employees.15Terrorist attacks and threatened or actual war may adversely affect our business.Our business is affected by general economic conditions and fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending, which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control. Terrorist attacks or threats, whether within the United States or abroad, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions impacting our suppliers or our customers may adversely impact our operations. Specifically, strategic targets such as energy related assets (which could include refineries that produce the motor fuel we purchase or ports in which crude oil is delivered) may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the United States. These occurrences could have an adverse impact on energy prices, including prices for motor fuels, and an adverse impact on our operations. Any or a combination of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We rely on our information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption of these systems or an act of cyber‑terrorism could adversely affect our business.We depend on our information technology (IT) systems to manage numerous aspects of our business transactions and provide analytical information to management. Our IT systems are an essential component of our business and growth strategies, and a serious disruption to our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, cyber‑security breaches or cyber‑terrorism, and computer viruses. Any disruption could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and cause our operating results to be reduced.Our future debt levels may impair our financial condition.We had $184.9 million of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2012, of which $148.2 million was secured by marketable securities. We have the ability to incur additional debt under our revolving credit facility. The level of our future indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility;•limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, the execution of our growth strategy and other activities;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our debt, which would reduce our cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other activities;•making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic conditions, our industry and government regulations and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to, changing conditions; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt.16In addition, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs. Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to service our debt will depend on market interest rates, since we anticipate that the interest rates applicable to our borrowings will fluctuate. If we are not able to pay our debts as they become due, we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities. We may not be able to refinance our debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or our assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenues.Our credit facilities have substantial restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.We are dependent upon the earnings and cash flow generated by our operations in order to meet our debt service obligations and to allow us to make cash distributions to our unitholders. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to engage in or expand our business activities or to pay distributions to our unitholders. For example, our credit facilities restricts our ability to, among other things:•Incur additional debt or issue guarantees;•Incur or permit liens to exist on certain property;•Make certain investments, acquisitions or other restricted payments;•Modify or terminate certain material contracts; and•Merge or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.In addition, our revolving credit agreement contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.Our future ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and other events or circumstances beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any provisions of our new credit facilities that are not cured or waived within the appropriate time periods provided in the applicable credit facility, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, our ability to make distributions to our unitholders will be inhibited and our lenders' commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.We depend on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.We are a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries. We have three subsidiaries that conduct all of our operations and own all of our assets. These subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations or make distributions to our unitholders.The impact of derivatives legislation by the United States Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of changes in commodity prices and interest rates and other risks associated with our business.The United States Congress recently adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The new legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on July 21, 2010 and requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. The CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic 17equivalent. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits. The financial reform legislation may also require compliance with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade‑execution requirements in connection with certain derivative activities, although the application of those provisions is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.The final rules will be phased in over time according to a specified schedule which is dependent on the finalization of certain other rules to be promulgated jointly by the CFTC and the SEC. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of some derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of some derivative contracts, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and potentially increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Risks Related to Our StructureSUSS owns and controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our general partner and its affiliates, including SUSS, have conflicts of interest with us and limited fiduciary duties and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders.SUSS owns and controls our general partner and appoints all of the officers and directors of our general partner. All of the officers and certain of the directors of our general partner are also officers and/or directors of SUSS. Although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders, the executive officers and directors of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to SUSS. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between SUSS and its affiliates, including our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:•Neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires SUSS to pursue a business strategy that favors us. The affiliates of our general partner have fiduciary duties to make decisions in their own best interests and in the best interest of their owners, which may be contrary to our interests. In addition, our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us or our unitholders, such as SUSS, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders.•All of the officers and certain of the directors of our general partner are also officers and/or directors of SUSS and owe fiduciary duties to SUSS. Certain officers of our general partner will also devote significant time to the business of SUSS and will be compensated by SUSS accordingly.•Other than as provided in the Omnibus Agreement, SUSS is not limited in its ability to compete with us and may offer business opportunities or sell assets to parties other than us.•The limited partner interests that SUSS owns permit it to effectively control any vote of our limited partners. SUSS is entitled to vote its units in accordance with its own interests, which may be contrary to the interests of our other unitholders.•Our partnership agreement limits the liability of, and reduces the fiduciary duties owed by, our general partner and also restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. As a result of purchasing common units, unitholders consent to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law.•Except in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval.•Our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, repayment of indebtedness and issuances of additional partnership securities and the level of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders.18•Our general partner determines whether or not to purchase and lease stores to SUSS pursuant to our 75 store option.•Our general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditure and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure or an expansion capital expenditure. These determinations can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders which, in turn, affects the ability of the subordinated units to convert to common units. •Our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units, to make incentive distributions or to accelerate the expiration of the subordination period.•Our partnership agreement permits us to distribute up to $25 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, non-working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions on our subordinated units or the incentive distribution rights.•Our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us.•Our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with its affiliates on our behalf. There is no limitation on the amounts our general partner can cause us to pay it or its affiliates.•Our general partner has limited its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations.•Our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units.•Our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates. In addition, our general partner will decide whether to retain separate counsel or others to perform services for us.•SUSS may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to SUSS' incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner or our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our common unitholders in certain situations.Our general partner has limited its liability regarding our obligations. Other than with respect to our new credit facilities, our general partner has limited its liability under contractual arrangements so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our general partner or its assets. Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner's fiduciary duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders, and we will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow.In addition, because we distribute all of our available cash, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement or our credit facilities on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The 19incurrence of bank borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy will result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.SUSS may compete with us or contract with third‑party wholesalers to distribute motor fuel to SUSS' convenience stores on a consignment basis.Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement and SUSS Distribution Contract, for a period of ten years, we are the exclusive distributor of all motor fuel purchased by SUSS for its existing Stripes® convenience stores and independently operated consignment locations. Additionally, SUSS must purchase any motor fuel it sells at its newly built, acquired or added retail stores from us, except if such stores are already party to a supply agreement or in the case of third-party consignment sales described below. If these provisions of the SUSS Distribution Contract and Omnibus Agreement expire at the end of their respective ten-year terms and are not renewed, SUSS will no longer be required to purchase motor fuel from us (except in the case of delivery arrangements that under the SUSS Distribution Contract extend beyond the ten-year term). SUSS could then compete with us to deliver motor fuel to its Stripes® stores and consignment locations. Furthermore, subject to our right to participate in acquisitions, SUSS is permitted to compete with us for investment opportunities, and SUSS is permitted to own an interest in entities that compete with us.Under the Omnibus Agreement, SUSS continues to have the right to contract for third‑party consignment sales of motor fuel with other wholesalers at any newly constructed or acquired locations. Under these arrangements, as the consignee, SUSS would not purchase any fuel and would instead receive a commission on sales made by the wholesaler. As a result, we will not distribute any volumes nor earn any revenues for fuel sold at these locations. SUSS is under no obligation to purchase fuel from us for its convenience stores if it determines that consignment arrangements with third parties are more advantageous to SUSS and its shareholders.Pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our general partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors and SUSS. Any such person or entity is not liable to us or to any limited partner under our partnership agreement for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our general partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders.Our partnership agreement limits the liability and duties of our general partner and restricts the remedies available to us and our common unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Our partnership agreement limits the liability and duties of our general partner, while also restricting the remedies available to our common unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Delaware partnership law permits such contractual reductions of fiduciary duty. By purchasing common units, common unitholders consent to be bound by the partnership agreement, and pursuant to our partnership agreement, each holder of common units consents to various actions and conflicts of interest contemplated in our partnership agreement that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under Delaware law. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example:•Our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to its capacity as general partner. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, our common unitholders. Decisions made by our general partner in its individual capacity will be made by SUSS, as the owner of our general partner, and not by the board of directors of our general partner. Examples of these decisions include: •Whether to exercise its limited call right; •How to exercise its voting rights with respect to any units it may own; •Whether to exercise its registration rights; and •Whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation or amendment to our partnership agreement. •Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning it believed that the decisions were not adverse to the interests of our partnership. 20•Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner and the officers and directors of our general partner will not be liable for monetary damages to us for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or those persons acted in bad faith or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that such person's conduct was criminal. •Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our limited partners with respect to any transaction involving an affiliate if the transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is: •approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval; or •approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates; or •the board of directors of our general partner acted in good faith in taking any action or failing to act. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.Cost reimbursements due to our general partner and its affiliates for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our general partner. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement and our partnership agreement. Neither our partnership agreement nor our Omnibus Agreement will limit the amount of expenses for which our general partner and its affiliates may be reimbursed. Our Omnibus Agreement and partnership agreement provide that our general partner will determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us. The reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees to our general partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of cash available to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to material additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although we do not believe, based upon our current operations, that we are so treated, a change in our business (or a change in current law) could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. We are subject to the entity-level Texas franchise tax. Imposition of any such additional taxes on us or an increase in the existing tax rates would reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us. 21The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time, members of the U.S. Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. One such legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income exception upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any such legislation will be reintroduced or will ultimately be enacted. However, it is possible that a change in law could affect us and may, if enacted, be applied retroactively. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. In addition to the risks discussed above, there are certain risks associated with an investment in our common units and the ownership of a limited partner interest in us, including tax risks to our unitholders. For a discussion of those particular risks, please see the section of the final prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission in connection with our IPO on September 21, 2012 captioned "Risk Factors".Item 1B.
