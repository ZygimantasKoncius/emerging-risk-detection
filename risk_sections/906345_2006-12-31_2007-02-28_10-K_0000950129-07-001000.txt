Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations. Insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders and create refinancing risk. Substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from our multifamily communities. As a result, our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the following:  delay in resident lease commencements;  decline in occupancy;  failure of residents to make rental payments when due;  the attractiveness of our properties to residents and potential residents;  our ability to adequately manage and maintain our properties;  competition from other available apartments and housing alternatives; and  changes in market rents. Cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing. We are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regards to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain, in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT; this requirement limits the cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments on our debt. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt or a refinancing may not occur on favorable terms, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 3 Table of Contents Unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact occupancy or rental rates. Economic conditions may significantly affect apartment home occupancy or rental rates. Occupancy and rental rates in the markets in which we operate, in turn, may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results. The risks that may affect conditions in these markets include the following:  changes in the national, regional and local economic climates;  local conditions, such as an oversupply of apartments or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area;  a future economic downturn which simultaneously effects more than one of our geographical markets; and  increased operating costs, if these costs cannot be passed through to residents. National, regional and local economic climates may be adversely affected should population or job growth slow. To the extent either of these conditions occurs in the markets in which we operate, market rents will likely be affected. We could also face challenges adequately managing and maintaining our properties should we experience increased operating costs. As a result, we may experience a loss of rental revenues, which may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to pay distributions to shareholders. Various changes could adversely impact the market price of our common shares. The market price of our publicly traded common shares depends on various conditions. The risks that may affect this market price include the following:  investor interest in our property portfolio;  the reputation and performance of REITs;  the attractiveness of REITs as compared to other investment vehicles;  the results of our financial condition and operations;  the perception of our growth and earnings potential;  dividend payment rates; and  increases in market rates, which may lead purchasers of our common shares to demand a higher yield. Development and construction risks could impact our profitability. We intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our property portfolio. Our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks that may increase our construction costs including the following:  inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required permits and authorizations, or problems with subcontractors could result in increased costs;  incurring construction costs for a property exceeding our original estimates due to increased materials, labor or other costs, or due to errors and omissions that occur in the design or construction process;  experiencing fluctuations in occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property, which may not be adequate to make the property profitable;  inability to obtain financing with favorable terms for the development of a community;  inability to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, resulting in increased costs;  incurring costs related to the abandonment of development opportunities which we have pursued and deemed unfeasible; and  our inability to successfully implement our development and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders. 4 Table of Contents We also develop and construct properties for unrelated third parties pursuant to guaranteed maximum price contracts. The terms of these contracts require us to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and we assume the risk the time and costs associated with our performance may be greater than was anticipated. As a result, our profitability on guaranteed maximum price contracts is dependent on our ability to predict these factors accurately. The time and costs may be affected by a variety of factors, including those listed above, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the terms of these contracts generally require a warranty period, which may have a duration of up to ten years, during which we may be required to repair, replace or rebuild a project in the event of a material defect. Our property acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected. In the normal course of our business, we continually evaluate a number of potential acquisitions and may acquire additional operating properties. The success of our acquisition activities is subject to a number of risks, including the following:  we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties into our existing operations;  our estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate; and  the expected occupancy and rental rates may differ from the actual results. Our inability to successfully implement our property acquisition strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders. We expect other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private investors and other apartment REITs will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. This competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition. Difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility. Real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly, especially when market conditions are poor. This may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, in order to maintain our status as a REIT, the Code imposes restrictions on our ability to sell properties held fewer than four years, which may cause us to incur losses thereby reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting distributions to shareholders. We have significant debt, which could have important consequences. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding debt of approximately $2.3 billion. This indebtedness could have important consequences, including:  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if we are unable to meet our mortgage obligations, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the mortgage;  our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions is increased; and  our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in business and industry is limited. Variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. We have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon the market index. In addition, we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders. 5 Table of Contents Issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties, dividend payment rates to our shareholders, development and capital expenditures, costs of operations and potential acquisitions. If our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. Accordingly, we could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future. Losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage. We carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties, which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets. We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future. However, some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, may be subject to coverage limitations. We exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we are liable for costs to investigate and remove or remediate hazardous or toxic substances on or in our properties, in some cases, regardless of whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of these substances. These costs, and other costs of investigation, remediation or removal of hazardous substances, may be substantial. Also, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on a property, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent the property or use the property as collateral. Additionally, we occasionally develop, manage, lease and/or operate various properties for third parties. Consequently, we may be considered to have been or to be an operator of these properties and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs that could relate to hazardous or toxic substances. Over the past several years, there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at high rates. Therefore, should we be named in a lawsuit regarding mold infiltration, the amount of damages may not be fully covered under insurance. Tax matters, including failure to qualify as a REIT, could have adverse consequences. We may not continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. The Internal Revenue Service may challenge our qualification as a REIT for prior years and new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the federal tax consequences of such qualification. For any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT:  we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax; 6 Table of Contents  we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify, thereby reducing our net earning available for operations, including any distributions to shareholders, as we would be required to pay significant income taxes for the year or years involved; and  our ability to expand our business and raise capital would be impaired, which may adversely affect the value of our common shares. We may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow. These potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property at either the corporate or individual property levels. Any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for distribution to our shareholders. Investments through joint ventures and partnerships involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor. Instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly, we may invest in a joint venture or partnership as a partner. These investments involve risks, including the possibility our partner may become insolvent, our partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours, or our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests. We and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost. The Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, or FHAA, and other federal, state and local laws generally require public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. These laws may require us to modify our existing properties. These laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs. Legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons. Although we believe our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements, we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with ADA, FHAA and other federal, state and local laws. Share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders. For us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals. As defined for federal income tax purposes, the term individuals includes a number of specified entities. To minimize the possibility we will fail to qualify as a REIT under this test, our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits. The ownership limits, as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities, may delay, defer or prevent a change in control. These provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares that may be attractive to you, or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares that might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction. Competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income. Our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes available for rent or sale. Competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartments and increase or maintain rents. 7 Table of Contents We depend on our key personnel. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us. Changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business. As a large publicly-traded owner of multifamily properties, we may become involved in legal proceedings, including consumer, employment, tort or commercial litigation, which if decided adversely to or settled by us, could result in liability that is material to our financial condition or results of operations. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Properties Our properties typically consist of mid-rise buildings or two- and three-story buildings in a landscaped setting and provide residents with a variety of amenities. Most of the properties have one or more swimming pools and a clubhouse and many have whirlpool spas, tennis courts and controlled-access gates. Many of the apartment homes offer additional features such as fireplaces, vaulted ceilings, microwave ovens, covered parking, icemakers, washers and dryers and ceiling fans. Operating Properties The 186 operating properties, including properties held through joint ventures, which we owned interests in and operated at December 31, 2006, averaged 905 square feet of living area per apartment home. For the year ended December 31, 2006, no single operating property accounted for greater than 2.1% of our total revenues. Our operating properties, including properties held through joint ventures, had a weighted average occupancy rate of 95.2% and 95.3% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Resident lease terms generally range from six to thirteen months. One hundred and fifty-nine of our operating properties have over 200 apartment homes, with the largest having 894 apartment homes. Our operating properties have an average age of 9.5 years (calculated on the basis of investment dollars). Our operating properties were constructed and placed in service as follows: Year Placed in Service Number of Operating Properties 2001 -2006 33 1996 -2000 57 1991 -1995 20 1986 -1990 41 1980 -1985 27 Prior to 1980 8 Property Table The following table sets forth information with respect to our operating properties at December 31, 2006. 8 Table of Contents OPERATING PROPERTIES Number of Year Placed Average Apartment 2006 Average Property and Location Apartments In Service Size (Sq.

The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts currently defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from depreciable operating property sales, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Diluted FFO also assumes conversion of all dilutive convertible securities, including minority interests, which are convertible into common shares. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. (b) Excludes apartment homes owned in joint ventures. (c) The 2005 results include the operations of Summit Properties Inc. subsequent to February 28, 2005. 16 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results and trends which might appear in the consolidated financial statements should not be interpreted as being indicative of future operations. We consider portions of this report to be forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, with respect to our expectations for future periods. Forward-looking statements do not discuss historical fact, but instead include statements related to expectations, projections, intentions or other items relating to the future. Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance our expectations will be achieved. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact should be deemed forward-looking statements. Reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements as they are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors beyond our control and could differ materially from our actual results and performance. Factors that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:  Insufficient cash flows could affect our ability to make required payments of debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders and create refinancing risk;  Unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact occupancy or rental rates;  Various changes could adversely impact the market price of our common shares;  Development and construction risks could impact our profitability;  Our property acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected;  Difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility;  Our variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk;  Issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition;  Losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage;  Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial loss;  Tax matters, including failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT) could have adverse consequences;  Investments in joint ventures and partnerships involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor;  Competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income; and  Changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report. Executive Summary Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the projected economic conditions, we expect moderate growth during 2007 from the revenue generated by our stabilized communities. The economic projections include meaningful job growth and population growth in a number of markets in which we operate and decreased housing demand due to rising interest rates resulting in multifamily apartment communities being an economically attractive alternative to purchasing a single-family home and positively affecting apartment housing demand. We intend to continue to focus on our market balance investment strategy and to improve our portfolio mix through the acquisition and disposition of real estate assets. We expect market concentration risk to be mitigated as our property operations are not centralized in any one market. In positioning for future growth, we intend to continue focusing on our development pipeline and maintain approximately $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in our current and future development pipelines. Total projected capital costs and the commencement of future developments may be impacted by increasing construction costs and other factors. 17 Table of Contents Property Portfolio Our multifamily property portfolio, excluding land held for future development and joint venture properties which we do not manage, is summarized as follows: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Apartment Apartment Homes Properties Homes Properties Operating Properties Las Vegas, Nevada 8,064 30 8,064 30 Dallas, Texas 7,773 21 8,643 24 Houston, Texas 5,696 13 6,810 15 Tampa, Florida 5,635 12 5,635 12 Charlotte, North Carolina 4,146 17 4,493 18 Washington, D.C.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, stabilization was achieved at two recently completed properties as follows: Number of Apartment Date of Date of Property and Location Homes Completion Stabilization Camden Farmers Market II Dallas, TX 284 3Q05 2Q06 Camden Dilworth Charlotte, NC 145 2Q06 3Q06 Acquisition Communities On January 31, 2006, we acquired the remaining 80% interest in Camden-Delta Westwind, LLC, a joint venture in which we had a 20% interest, in accordance with the Agreement and Assignment of Limited Liability Company Interest. The 80% interest was previously owned by Westwind Equity, LLC (Westwind), an unrelated third-party. As a result of the acquisition, we paid Westwind $31.0 million, which included a $2.0 million non-refundable earnest money deposit paid in October 2005. Concurrent with this transaction, the mezzanine loan we had provided to the joint venture, which totaled $12.1 million, was canceled. Additionally, we repaid the outstanding balance of a third party construction loan, totaling $46.8 million. We used proceeds from our unsecured line of credit facility to fund this purchase. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The intangible assets acquired at acquisition include in-place leases of $0.5 million. In July 2006, we acquired Camden Stoneleigh, a 390-apartment home community located in Austin, Texas, for $35.3 million using proceeds from our unsecured line of credit. The purchase price of this property was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The intangible assets acquired at acquisition include in-place leases of $0.6 million and above or below market leases of $0.1 million. Dispositions and Partial Sales to Joint Ventures Included in Continuing Operations During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized gains of $91.5 million from the partial sale of nine properties to an affiliated unconsolidated joint venture. This partial sale generated net proceeds of approximately $170.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized gains of $132.1 million from the partial sales of twelve properties to twelve affiliated unconsolidated joint ventures. These partial sales generated net proceeds of approximately $316.8 million. The gains recognized on the partial sales of these assets were included in continuing operations as we retained a partial interest in the ventures which own these assets. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized gains of $0.5 million and $4.7 million on the partial sales of land to two joint ventures located in Houston, Texas and College Park, Maryland, respectively. The gains recognized on the sales of these assets were included in continuing operations as we retained a partial interest in the ventures which own these assets. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a gain of $0.8 million on the sale of land located adjacent to one of our pre-development assets in College Park, Maryland. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a gain of $0.8 million on the sale of land located adjacent to one of our pre-development assets in Houston, Texas. Also during 2005, we sold undeveloped land located in Dallas, Texas to an unrelated third party. In connection with our decision to sell this undeveloped land, we recognized an impairment loss of $0.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recognized gains totaling $1.6 million on the sales of land located adjacent to two of our pre-development assets in Houston, Texas. These gains were included in continuing operations as the cash flows from these land parcels were not separately identifiable from the cash flows generated by the adjacent pre-development assets. 19 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations includes the operations of properties, including land, sold during the period or classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2006. The components of earnings classified as discontinued operations include separately identifiable property-specific revenues, expenses, depreciation and interest expense, if any. The gain or loss on the disposal of the held for sale properties is also classified as discontinued operations. We intend to maintain a strategy of managing our invested capital through the selective sale of properties and to utilize the proceeds to fund investments with higher anticipated growth prospects in our markets. A summary of our 2006 dispositions and properties held for sale as of December 31, 2006 is as follows: Number of ($ in millions) Apartment Date of Net Book Property and Location Homes Disposition Year Built Value (1) Dispositions Camden Highlands Plano, TX 160 1Q06 1985 n/a Camden View Tucson, AZ 365 1Q06 1974 n/a Camden Trails Dallas, TX 264 2Q06 1984 n/a Camden Wilshire Houston, TX 536 2Q06 1982 n/a Camden Pass Tucson, AZ 456 2Q06 1984 n/a Camden Oaks Dallas, TX 446 3Q06 1985 n/a Camden Wyndham Houston, TX 448 4Q06 1978/1981 n/a Camden Crossing Houston, TX 366 4Q06 1982 n/a Held for Sale Camden Trace Maryland Heights, MO 372 n/a 1972 $ 6.9 Camden Taravue St. Louis, MO 304 n/a 1975 5.9 Camden Downs Louisville, KY 254 n/a 1975 5.2 Total apartment homes sold and held for sale 3,971 (1) Net Book Value is land and buildings and improvements less the related accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized gains of $78.8 million from the sale of eight operating properties to unaffiliated third parties. These sales generated net proceeds of approximately $137.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized gains of $36.1 million from the sale of three operating properties, containing 1,317 apartment homes, to unaffiliated third parties. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recognized a gain of $8.4 million on the sale of one operating property, containing 552 apartment homes, to an unaffiliated third party. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the operations of two properties previously included in discontinued operations were reclassified to continuing operations as management made the decision not to sell these assets. As a result, we adjusted the current and prior period consolidated financial statements to reflect the 20 Table of Contents necessary reclassifications. Additionally, we recorded a depreciation charge of $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 on these assets. Upon our decision to abandon efforts to develop certain land parcels and to market these parcels as held for sale, we reclassified the operating expenses associated with these assets to discontinued operations. At December 31, 2006, we had several undeveloped land parcels classified as held for sale as follows: ($ in millions) Net Book Location Acres Value Southeast Florida 3.1 $ 12.3 Dallas 2.6 2.5 Total land held for sale $ 14.8 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we sold undeveloped land totaling an aggregate of 8.7 acres to unrelated third parties. In connection with these sales, we received net proceeds of $41.0 million and recognized gains totaling $20.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold undeveloped land totaling 2.1 acres to an unrelated third party. In connection with this sale, we recognized a gain of $1.0 million. Land sales during the year ended December 31, 2005 were immaterial. During 2004, in connection with our decision to dispose of a 2.4 acre parcel of undeveloped land located in Dallas, we incurred an impairment charge of $1.1 million to write-down the carrying value of the land to its fair value, less costs to sell.

Of this amount, $285.7 million related to our wholly-owned projects currently under development. Additionally, at December 31, 2006, we had $84.2 million invested in land held for future development. Included in this amount was $41.9 million related to projects we expect to begin constructing during 2007. We also had $36.1 million invested in land tracts adjacent to development projects, which are being utilized in conjunction with those projects. Upon completion of these development projects, we may utilize this land to further develop apartment homes in these areas. We may also sell certain parcels of these undeveloped land tracts to third parties for commercial and retail development. 22 Table of Contents Geographic Diversification At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our investments in various geographic areas, excluding investments in joint ventures, were as follows: (in thousands) 2006 2005 Washington, D.C.

Where appropriate, comparisons of income and expense on communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollars-per-weighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period. Selected weighted averages for the years ended December 31 are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Average monthly property revenue per apartment home $ 936 $ 857 $ 765 Annualized total property expenses per apartment home $ 4,293 $ 3,986 $ 3,737 Weighted average number of operating apartment homes owned 100% 53,387 50,765 41,712 Weighted average occupancy of operating apartment homes owned 100% 95.1 % 95.0 % 94.1 % 23 Table of Contents Property-level operating results The following tables present the property-level revenues and property-level expenses, excluding discontinued operations, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004: Apartment Year Ended Homes December 31, Change ($ in thousands) at 12/31/06 2006 2005 $ % Property revenues Same store communities 33,465 $ 336,076 $ 314,308 $ 21,768 6.9 % Summit same store communities 13,100 171,943 133,584 38,359 28.7 Non-same store communities 3,154 38,765 22,593 16,172 71.6 Summit non-same store communities 833 14,741 9,975 4,766 47.8 Development and lease-up communities 4,391 13,585 405 13,180 100.0 Dispositions/other  24,320 41,216 (16,896 ) (41.0 ) Total property revenues 54,943 $ 599,430 $ 522,081 $ 77,349 14.8 % Property expenses Same store communities 33,465 $ 137,290 $ 130,190 $ 7,100 5.5 % Summit same store communities 13,100 57,450 45,865 11,585 25.3 Non-same store communities 3,154 13,934 7,789 6,145 78.9 Summit non-same store communities 833 5,088 3,863 1,225 31.7 Development and lease-up communities 4,391 4,308 87 4,221 100.0 Dispositions/other  11,128 14,566 (3,438 ) (23.6 ) Total property expenses 54,943 $ 229,198 $ 202,360 $ 26,838 13.3 % Same store communities are communities we (or Summit) owned and were stabilized as of January 1, 2005.

Same store property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $11.7 million, or 3.7% from 2004 primarily from higher rental income per apartment home and decreased vacancy loss per apartment home. Our revenue growth is the result of improving market fundamentals resulting from growth in employment and population in the majority of our markets, the increasing cost of ownership versus rental, and rising interest rates and construction costs limiting new supply. In addition, we continue to believe our strong operating performance is not only the result of improving operating fundamentals, but also the continued enhancements we are making to many of our operational components, such as our web-based property management and revenue management systems. We believe these enhancements have created efficiencies within our business and have allowed us to take advantage of improvements in the rental market. Total property expenses from our same store communities increased 5.5% and 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004, respectively. The increases in same store property expenses per apartment home for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 were primarily due to increases in repair and maintenance, salaries and utilities expenses. These three expense categories represent approximately 60% of total operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 and increased approximately 8% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increases for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004 were primarily due to increases in salary and benefit expenses, real estate tax expenses and utilities expenses. These three expense categories represent approximately 68% of total operating costs for the period, and increased approximately 5% as compared to 2004. The revenues and expenses related to Summit same store communities represent the operations of those assets since February 28, 2005, the effective time of the Summit merger. Increases in revenues and expenses on Summit same store communities for 2006 compared to 2005 and for 2005 compared to 2004 are due to our ownership of those assets for only a partial year, beginning in 2005. Non-same store analysis and other analysis Property revenues from non-same store, development and lease-up communities increased $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and increased $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase during both periods was primarily due to the completion and lease-up of properties in our development pipeline. Property revenues from non-same store, development and lease-up communities acquired in the Summit merger are only for periods subsequent to February 28, 2005, the effective date of the merger. Property revenues from dispositions/other decreased $16.9 million and $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004, respectively. Dispositions/other property revenues earned during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily related to properties partially sold to joint ventures of $20.0 million and retail lease income of $3.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, dispositions/other property revenues earned primarily related to properties partially sold into joint ventures of $35.1 million, retail lease income of $2.3 million and income associated with the amortization of above and below market leases on acquired communities of $2.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, dispositions/other property revenue earned primarily related to properties partially sold into joint ventures of $40.8 million. Property expenses from non-same store, development and lease-up communities increased $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and $13.6 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in expenses during both periods was primarily due to the completion and lease-up of properties in our development pipeline. Property expenses from non-same store, development and lease-up communities acquired in the Summit merger are only for periods subsequent to February 28, 2005, the effective date of the merger. Property expenses from dispositions/other decreased $3.4 million and $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005 was due to the partial sale of nine properties to a joint venture in 2006. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005 as 25 Table of Contents compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was due to the twelve communities partially sold to twelve individual affiliated joint ventures during 2005.

The increase in fee and asset management income during 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to fees earned on our third-party construction projects. The fees earned from the three joint ventures formed during the year ended December 31, 2006 were consistent with the structuring fees we earned from the partial sale of 12 properties to joint ventures in 2005. The increase in fee and asset management income during 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to the structuring fees we earned from the partial sale of 12 properties to joint ventures in 2005. Income from the sale of technology investments totaled $1.6 million, $24.2 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a $24.2 million gain on the sale of our investment in Rent.com, which was acquired by eBay Inc. during the first quarter of 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received additional distributions totaling $1.6 million from the sale of our investment in Rent.com. Interest and other income increased $2.4 million for 2006 as compared to 2005 and decreased $3.7 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. Interest income, which primarily relates to interest earned on notes receivable outstanding under our mezzanine financing program, decreased $2.9 million for 2006 as compared to 2005 and decreased $2.0 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. These decreases were due to repayments of notes receivable during all years. Other income was $5.3 million in 2006 and $1.7 million in 2004. Other income represents income recognized upon the settlement of legal, insurance and warranty claims and contract disputes. Income on deferred compensation plans increased $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and decreased $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004. The changes in income primarily related to the performance of the assets held in the deferred compensation plan for plan participants. 26 Table of Contents Other expenses Year Ended Year Ended December 31, Change December 31, Change ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 $ % 2005 2004 $ % Property management $ 18,490 $ 16,145 $ 2,345 14.5 % $ 16,145 $ 11,924 $ 4,221 35.4 % Fee and asset management 9,382 6,897 2,485 36.0 6,897 3,856 3,041 78.9 General and administrative 37,584 24,845 12,739 51.3 24,845 18,536 6,309 34.0 Transaction compensation and merger expenses  14,085 (14,085 ) (100.0 ) 14,085  14,085 100.0 Impairment provisions on technology investments  130 (130 ) (100.0 ) 130  130 100.0 Interest 118,344 111,548 6,796 6.1 111,548 78,260 33,288 42.5 Depreciation and amortization 158,510 164,705 (6,195 ) (3.8 ) 164,705 94,730 69,975 73.9 Amortization of deferred financing costs 3,813 3,739 74 2.0 3,739 2,697 1,042 38.6 Expense on deferred compensation plans 10,116 6,421 3,695 57.5 6,421 6,760 (339 ) (5.0 ) Total non-property income $ 356,239 $ 348,515 $ 7,724 2.2 % $ 348,515 $ 216,763 $ 131,752 60.8 % Property management expense, which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, increased $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and increased $4.2 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. The increases were primarily due to salary and benefit expenses, including long-term incentive compensation and amortization expense recorded for share awards. Additionally, increases in 2005 as compared to 2004 included the costs of additional regional supervision personnel and regional offices from the Summit merger. Property management expenses were 3.1% of total property revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Fee and asset management expense, which represents expenses related to third-party construction projects and property management, increased $2.5 million for 2006 as compared to 2005 and increased $3.0 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. These increases were primarily due to increases in costs and cost over-runs on third-party construction projects which totaled $7.0 million, $5.4 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $12.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and increased $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004, and were 5.8%, 4.1% and 4.1% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to increases in salary and benefit expenses, including long-term incentive compensation and amortization expense recorded for share awards, acceleration of vesting of previously granted share awards and legal costs. During 2006, an aggregate of 76,542 share awards that otherwise would have vested from time to time over the next five years became immediately exercisable. By accelerating the vesting of these share awards, we recognized a one-time expense of approximately $4.2 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to costs associated with pursuing potential transactions not consummated, increases in salary and benefit expenses, including the addition of internal audit, information technology and personnel associated with the Summit merger, and professional fees associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 compliance requirements and information technology projects. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we incurred transaction compensation and merger expenses totaling $14.1 million related to the Summit merger. Merger expenses primarily related to training and transitional employee costs. Gross interest cost before interest capitalized to development properties increased $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and increased $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 2005. The overall increase in interest expense was due primarily to an increase in debt outstanding as a result of continued funding of the development pipeline, increases in the effective interest rate associated with variable rate debt and interest on notes acquired in the Summit merger. These increases were partially offset by the repayment of debt associated with our equity offering in 2006. Interest capitalized increased $3.1 million for 2006 as compared to 2005 and increased $8.2 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in interest capitalized was due to higher average balances in our development pipeline, including the increase in development assets acquired in the Summit merger in 2005. 27 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased 3.6% during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and increased 72.9% during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004. These variances were due primarily to amortization of the value of in-place leases acquired in connection with the merger with Summit of $32.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, offset by additional depreciation on assets acquired, depreciation charges on assets reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations, and new development and capital improvements placed in service during the preceding year. Expense on deferred compensation plans increased $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and decreased $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004. The changes in expense primarily related to the performance of the assets held in the deferred compensation plan for plan participants.

Gain on sale of properties for the year ended December 31, 2005 included a gain of $132.1 million from the partial sale of 12 operating communities to affiliated joint ventures and $0.8 million from the sale of undeveloped land to an unaffiliated third party. Gain on sale of properties for the year ended December 31, 2004 included gains of $1.6 million from the sales of undeveloped land to unaffiliated third parties. Equity in income of joint ventures decreased $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005, and increased $9.7 million for the year December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004. Changes from period to period are due to an increase in the number of properties and gains recognized on the sale of assets held through joint ventures. We recognized $2.8 million of gains on the sale of three properties held through a joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized $11.2 million in gains on the sale of three properties held in joint ventures. The gains recognized during the year ended December 31, 2005 were partially offset by losses recognized in one joint venture due to debt retirement costs associated with the refinancing of debt totaling $2.0 million. Distributions on perpetual preferred units decreased $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of the redemption of $53 million Series C preferred units in September 2004 and January 2005. Original issuance costs of $0.4 million and $0.7 million were expensed in connection with these redemptions in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income allocated to common units and other minority interests increased $13.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 and decreased $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in 2006 was due primarily to gains recognized on the partial sale of eight properties held in Camden Operating, L.P. to a joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2006. A portion of the gains recognized were allocated to minority interest holders in Camden Operating, L.P. 28 Table of Contents Funds from Operations (FFO) Management considers FFO to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity REIT. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) currently defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from depreciable operating property sales, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Diluted FFO also assumes conversion of all dilutive convertible securities, including convertible minority interests, which are convertible into common shares. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and data included elsewhere in this report. FFO is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance. Additionally, FFO as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation. Reconciliations of net income to diluted FFO for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: (in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Funds from operations Net income $ 232,846 $ 199,086 $ 41,341 Real estate depreciation, including discontinued operations 157,233 168,777 104,339 Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 478 (6,867 ) 2,097 Gain on sale of properties, including discontinued operations (170,304 ) (168,221 ) (8,368 ) Income allocated to common units, including discontinued operations 17,537 2,515 4,260 Funds from operations  diluted $ 237,790 $ 195,290 $ 143,669 Weighted average shares  basic 56,660 52,000 41,430 Incremental shares issuable from assumed conversion of: Common share options and awards granted 725 483 434 Common units 3,868 3,830 2,438 Weighted average shares  diluted 61,253 56,313 44,302 Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures included in FFO for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 includes net gains totaling $2.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively, from the sale of properties held in joint ventures. Included in the net gains recognized during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of mortgages associated with the sold properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility, which we believe enhances our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available. We intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by:  using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and common and preferred equity;  extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where possible;  managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt;  borrowing on an unsecured basis in order to maintain a substantial number of unencumbered assets; and  maintaining conservative coverage ratios. 29 Table of Contents Our interest expense coverage ratio, net of capitalized interest, was 2.9, 2.8 and 3.0 times for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense coverage ratio is derived by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of income from continuing operations before gain on sale of properties, equity in income (loss) of joint ventures and minority interests, depreciation, amortization, interest expense and income from discontinued operations. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, 80.5%, 78.8% and 88.6%, respectively, of our properties (based on invested capital) were unencumbered. Our weighted average maturity of debt, excluding our line of credit, was 4.7 years at December 31, 2006. As a result of the significant cash flow generated by our operations, the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other short-term borrowings, proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments and access to the capital markets by issuing securities under our automatic shelf registration statement, we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs during 2007 including:  normal recurring operating expenses;  current debt service requirements;  recurring capital expenditures;  initial funding of property developments, acquisitions and notes receivable; and  the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. One of our principal long-term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt, including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit used to fund development and acquisition activities. For unsecured notes, we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of those notes will be repaid prior to maturity. Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, we had several development projects in various stages of construction, for which a total estimated cost of $208.6 million remained to be funded. We intend to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, draws on our unsecured credit facility and property dispositions. In December 2006, we announced our Board of Trust Managers had declared a dividend distribution of $0.66 per share to holders of record as of December 22, 2006 of our common shares. The dividend was subsequently paid on January 17, 2007. We paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units. This distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annualized dividend rate of $2.64 per share or unit. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $231.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 from $200.8 million for the same period in 2005. The increases were primarily due to additional property revenues from recently acquired properties and growth in property revenues from our stabilized communities. This increase was partially offset by the loss of property revenues due to sales of properties and other transactional expenses. Cash flows used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $52.1 million, as compared to $207.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. We incurred $463.1 million in property development, acquisition and capital improvement costs during 2006 as compared to $301.6 million during 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid $8.2 million of severance benefits associated with the Summit merger. Notes receivable  affiliates increased $41.6 million as five mezzanine loans were provided to joint ventures formed during the year ended December 31, 2006. Proceeds received from sales of properties and technology investments, sales of assets to joint ventures and joint venture distributions representing returns of investments totaled $445.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily consisted of transactions associated with the Summit merger and expenditures related to real estate assets as we paid $509.8 million in connection with the Summit merger, either as consideration paid at acquisition or for merger liabilities assumed. These payments were ultimately funded using a portion of the proceeds received from the sales of properties and technology investments and distributions from joint ventures representing returns of investments, which totaled an aggregate of $555.7 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $180.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of the repayment of our line of credit of $45.0 million, payments of $227.3 million related to the payoff of senior unsecured notes and one mortgage note and distributions to shareholders and minority interest holders 30 Table of Contents of $166.2 million. The cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $254.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of 3.6 million common shares. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $6.0 million, primarily due to a net increase in our unsecured line of credit of $195.0 million and proceeds from notes payable of $248.4 million, partially offset by the repayment of a secured credit facility assumed in our merger with Summit of $188.5 million, the repayment of $79.8 million in notes payable and distributions to shareholders and minority interest holders and redemption of preferred units of $165.8 million. Financial Flexibility In January 2005, we entered into a credit agreement which increased our unsecured credit facility to $600 million, with the ability to further increase it up to $750 million. This $600 million unsecured line of credit was originally scheduled to mature in January 2008. In January 2006, we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement to extend the maturity by two years to January 2010 and to amend certain covenants. The scheduled interest rate is based on spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Prime Rate. The scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change. Advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. These bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of $300 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit. The line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations, all of which we were in compliance with at December 31, 2006. Our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to $100 million in letters of credit. While our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line, it does reduce the amount available. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $31.1 million, and had $362.9 million available, under our unsecured line of credit. As an alternative to our unsecured line of credit, we from time to time borrow using competitively bid unsecured short-term notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group. Such borrowings vary in term and pricing and are typically priced at interest rates below those available under the unsecured line of credit. During 2006 and 2005, we repaid $200.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of maturing unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 6.8% and 3.6%, respectively. We also repaid one conventional mortgage note during 2006 totaling $13.1 million, which had an interest rate of 7.6%. Additionally, we repaid six conventional mortgage notes during 2005 totaling $40.8 million which had a weighted average interest rate of 7.3%. We repaid all notes payable using proceeds available under our unsecured line of credit. In connection with our partial sale of nine apartment communities to a joint venture during 2006, as discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, three variable rate tax-exempt mortgage notes totaling $30.5 million were assumed by the joint venture. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the weighted average interest rate on our floating rate debt, which includes our unsecured line of credit, was 5.4% and 4.5%, respectively. In June 2006, we issued 3.6 million common shares at $71.25 per share in a public equity offering. We used the net proceeds of $254.9 million to reduce indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit and for general corporate purposes. We filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission during 2006 that became effective upon filing. We may use the shelf registration statement to offer, from time to time, common shares, preferred shares, debt securities or warrants. Our declaration of trust provides that we may issue up to 110,000,000 shares of beneficial interest, consisting of 100,000,000 common shares and 10,000,000 preferred shares. As of December 31, 2006, we had 65,005,959 common shares outstanding under our declaration of trust. 31 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: (in millions) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Debt maturities $ 2,331.0 $ 219.9 $ 200.7 $ 198.2 $ 658.8 $ 248.4 $ 805.0 Interest payments (1) 569.8 119.2 110.7 97.4 69.0 46.1 127.4 Non-cancelable operating lease payments 15.3 2.5 2.3 2.1 1.9 1.5 5.0 Postretirement benefit obligations 2.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 1.2 Construction contracts 156.5 127.4 29.1     $ 3,074.8 $ 469.2 $ 343.0 $ 297.9 $ 729.9 $ 296.2 $ 938.6 (1) Includes contractual interest payments for our line of credit, senior unsecured notes, medium-term notes and secured notes. The interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates and our line of credit were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2006. The joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded with secured, third-party debt. We are not committed to any additional funding on third-party debt in relation to our joint ventures. We are committed to funding an additional $9.0 million under mezzanine loans provided to joint ventures. We have guaranteed our proportionate interest on construction loans in three of our development joint ventures. See further discussion of our investments in various joint ventures in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Inflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from 6 to 13 months. In an inflationary environment, we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases. The short-term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse affects of inflation. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are those most important to the presentation of a companys financial condition and results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We follow financial accounting and reporting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Income recognition. Our rental and other property income is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned. Other property income consists primarily of utility rebillings, and administrative, application and other transactional fees charged to our residents. Retail lease income is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any construction period if we are determined not to be the owner of the tenant improvements. Interest, fee and asset management and all other sources of income are recognized as earned. Capital expenditures. We capitalize renovation and improvement costs we believe extend the economic lives and enhance the earnings of the related assets. Capital expenditures, including carpet, appliances and HVAC unit replacements, subsequent to initial construction are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20 years. Accounting for Joint Ventures. We make co-investments with unrelated third parties and are required to determine whether to consolidate or use the equity method of accounting for these ventures. FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (as revised) and Emerging Issues Task Force No. 04-05, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights are two of the primary sources of accounting guidance in this area. Appropriate application of these relatively complex rules requires substantial management judgment. Asset impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash 32 Table of Contents flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows and costs to sell, an impairment charge equal to the excess is recognized. Cost capitalization. Real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges. Carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development. Expenditures directly related to the development, acquisition and improvement of real estate assets, excluding internal costs relating to acquisitions of operating properties, are capitalized at cost as land, buildings and improvements. Indirect development costs, including salaries and benefits and other related costs attributable to the development of properties, are also capitalized. All construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the balance sheet in properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed. Upon substantial completion of the apartment homes, the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land, respectively, and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation. Where possible, we stage our construction to allow leasing and occupancy during the construction period, which we believe minimizes the duration of the lease-up period following completion of construction. Our accounting policy related to properties in the development and leasing phase is all operating expenses associated with completed apartment homes are expensed. Allocations of Purchase Price. Upon the acquisition of real estate, we allocate the purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, which includes land, buildings, furniture and fixtures, the value of in-place leases, including above and below market leases, and acquired liabilities. When allocating the purchase price to acquired properties, we allocated costs to the estimated intangible value of in-place leases and above or below market leases and to the estimated fair value of furniture and fixtures, land and buildings on a value determined by assuming the property was vacant by applying methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of income-producing property. Depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The value of in-place leases and above or below market leases is amortized over the estimated average remaining life of leases in-place at the time of acquisition. Estimates of fair value of acquired debt are based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Use of Estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures. Our more significant estimates relate to determining the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisitions, estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying value of our real estate assets, estimates of the useful lives of our assets, reserves related to co-insurance requirements under our property, general liability and employee benefit insurance programs and estimates of expected losses of variable interest entities. Future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Also, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R))requiring the compensation cost relating to share-based payments be recognized over their vesting periods in the income statement based on their estimated fair values. In April 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Shared-Based Payment providing for a phased-in implementation process for SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for all public entities in the first annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. The impact of adopting this pronouncement is discussed in Note 12 Share-based Compensation. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS No. 154). This pronouncement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and revises the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. This pronouncement also requires changes to the method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. 33 Table of Contents It does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements, including those which are in a transition phase as of the effective date. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. EITF Issue No. 04-5 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls, and should consolidate, a limited partnership or a similar entity. EITF Issue No. 04-5 was effective after June 29, 2005, for all newly formed limited partnerships and for any pre-existing limited partnerships that modify their partnership agreements after that date. General partners of all other limited partnerships are required to apply the consensus no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-5 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 78-9-1, Interaction of AICPA Statement of Position 78-9 and EITF Issue No. 04-5. The EITF acknowledged the consensus in EITF Issue No. 04-5 conflicted with certain aspects of Statement of Position (SOP) 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. The EITF agreed with the assessment of whether a general partner, or the general partners as a group, controls a limited partnership should be consistent for all limited partnerships, irrespective of the industry within which the limited partnership operates. Accordingly, the guidance in SOP 78-9 was amended in FSP 78-9-1 to be consistent with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 04-5. The effective dates for this FSP are the same as those mentioned above in EITF Issue No. 04-5. The adoption of FSP 78-9-1 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FASB Interpretation (FIN) 46(R)-6, Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). FIN 46(R)-6 addresses how a reporting enterprise should determine variability associated with a variable interest entity or variable interests in an entity when applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) and is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2006. We will evaluate the impact of FIN 46(R)-6 at the time any reconsideration event occurs, as defined by the provisions of FIN 46(R), and for any new entities with which we become involved in future periods. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position, if the position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We have assessed the potential impact of FIN 48 and our adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement does not require new fair value measurements, but is applied to the extent other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements. The statement emphasizes fair value as a market-based measurement which should be determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. We will be required to disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the inputs used to develop the measurements, and the effect of certain of the measurements on earnings (or changes in net assets) for the period. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not anticipate the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), which requires an employer to recognize the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. SFAS No. 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. Our adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Weighted Weighted Average Weighted Average Weighted Maturity Average Maturity Average Amount (in years) Interest % Of Amount (in years) Interest % Of (in millions) (1) Rate Total (in millions) (1) Rate Total Fixed rate debt $ 2,059.6 4.3 5.4 % 88.4 % $ 2,285.2 4.9 5.5 % 86.8 % Variable rate debt 271.4 18.7 5.4 11.6 347.9 21.8 4.5 13.2 (1) Excludes balances outstanding under our unsecured line of credit We use variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline. To the extent we incur additional variable rate indebtedness, our exposure to increases in interest rates in an inflationary period would increase. We believe such increases in interest expense as a result of inflation would not significantly impact our distributable cash flow. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Our response to this item is included in a separate section at the end of this report beginning on page F-1. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Securities Exchange Act (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Changes in internal controls. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurring during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 35 Table of Contents Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as follows: A process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of trust managers, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records in reasonable detail that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  Provide reasonable assurance transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management concluded our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2006. Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. Deloitte & Touche LLPs attestation report regarding the effectiveness of managements assessment of internal controls over financial reporting is included herein. 36 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Trust Managers and the Shareholders of Camden Property Trust We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Camden Property Trust and subsidiaries (the Trust) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Trusts management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of trust managers, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trust managers of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 of the Trust and our reports dated February 28, 2007 express unqualified opinions on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

Steen Attorney-in-fact 46 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Trust Managers and the Shareholders of Camden Property Trust We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Camden Property Trust and subsidiaries (the Trust) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Trusts management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Camden Property Trust and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2007 (presented herein) expresses an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting.

F-6 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Business Business. Formed on May 25, 1993, Camden Property Trust, a Texas real estate investment trust (REIT), is engaged in the ownership, development, construction and management of multifamily apartment communities. Our multifamily apartment communities are referred to as communities, multifamily communities, properties, or multifamily properties in the following discussion. As of December 31, 2006, we owned interests in, operated or were developing 197 multifamily properties comprising 67,631 apartment homes located in 13 states. We had 3,788 apartment homes under development at 11 of our multifamily properties, including 1,069 apartment homes at three multifamily properties owned through joint ventures, 26 apartment homes at one operating property, and several sites we intend to develop into multifamily apartment communities. Additionally, three properties comprised of 930 apartment homes were designated as held for sale. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include our assets, liabilities and operations and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and partnerships. We also assess the consolidation of any entity in which we have an equity interest. Any entities that do not meet the criteria for consolidation, but where we exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. Any entities that do not meet the criteria for consolidation where we do not exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures. Our more significant estimates relate to determining the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisitions, estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying value of our real estate assets, estimates of the useful lives of our assets, reserves related to co-insurance requirements under our property, general liability and employee benefit insurance programs and estimates of expected losses of variable interest entities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reportable Segments. Our multifamily communities are geographically diversified throughout the United States and management evaluates operating performance on an individual property level. However, as each of our apartment communities has similar economic characteristics, residents, and products and services, our apartment communities have been aggregated into one reportable segment with activities related to the ownership, development, construction and management of multifamily communities. Our multifamily communities generate rental revenue and other income through the leasing of apartment homes, which comprised 95% of our total consolidated revenues, excluding non-recurring gains on technology investments, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Cash and Cash Equivalents. All cash and investments in money market accounts and other highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash and cash equivalents. Restricted Cash. Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for property taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, cash required to be segregated for the repayment of residents security deposits and escrowed amounts related to our development activities. Substantially all restricted cash is invested in demand and short-term instruments. Real Estate Assets, at Cost. Real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges. Carrying charges, principally interest and real estate taxes, of land under development and buildings under construction are capitalized as part of properties under development and buildings and improvements to the extent such charges do not cause the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net realizable value. Expenditures directly related to the development, acquisition and improvement of real estate assets, excluding internal costs relating to acquisitions of F-7 Table of Contents operating properties, are capitalized at cost as land, buildings and improvements. Indirect development costs, including salaries and benefits and other related costs that are clearly attributable to the development of properties, are also capitalized. All construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the balance sheet in properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed. Upon substantial completion of the apartment homes, the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land, respectively, and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation. Upon the acquisition of real estate, we allocate the purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, which includes land, buildings, furniture and fixtures, the value of in-place leases, including above and below market leases, and acquired liabilities. When allocating the purchase price to acquired properties, we allocated costs to the estimated intangible value of in-place leases and above or below market leases and to the estimated fair value of furniture and fixtures, land and buildings on a value determined by assuming the property was vacant by applying methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of income-producing property. Depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The value of in-place leases and above or below market leases is amortized over the estimated average remaining life of leases in-place at the time of acquisition. Estimates of fair value of acquired debt are based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Depreciation and amortization is computed over the expected useful lives of depreciable property on a straight-line basis as follows: Estimated Useful Life Buildings and improvements 5-35 years Furniture, fixtures, equipment and other 3-20 years Intangible assets (in-place leases and above and below market leases) 6-13 months As discussed above, carrying charges are principally interest and real estate taxes capitalized as part of properties under development and buildings and improvements. Capitalized interest was $20.6 million in 2006, $17.5 million in 2005 and $9.3 million in 2004. Capitalized real estate taxes were $2.6 million, $2.5 million and $2.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. All operating expenses associated with completed apartment homes for properties in the development and leasing phase are expensed. Upon substantial completion of the project, all apartment homes are considered operating and we begin expensing all items that were previously considered carrying costs. We capitalize renovation and improvement costs which we believe extend the economic lives and enhance the earnings of our multifamily properties. Capital expenditures totaled $58.5 million and $41.0 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Included in the $58.5 million for 2006 is $13.7 million of non-recurring capital improvements on renovation and rehabilitation projects at certain of our multifamily properties. Costs recorded as repair and maintenance include all costs which do not alter the primary use, extend the expected useful life or improve the safety or efficiency of the related asset. Our largest repair and maintenance expenditures related to landscaping, interior painting and floor coverings. Property operating and maintenance expense and income from discontinued operations included repair and maintenance expenses totaling $41.6 million in 2006, $36.5 million in 2005 and $30.9 million in 2004. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows and costs to sell, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. F-8 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations. The results of operations for properties sold during the period or classified as held for sale at the end of the current period are required to be classified as discontinued operations in the current and prior periods. The property-specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include net operating income, depreciation expense and interest expense. The gain or loss on the eventual disposal of the held for sale properties is also classified as discontinued operations. Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell, and are presented separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent to classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded. Properties sold by our unconsolidated entities are not included in discontinued operations and related gains or losses are reported as a component of equity in income of joint ventures. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the operations of two properties previously included in discontinued operations were reclassified to continuing operations as management made the decision not to sell these assets. As a result, we adjusted the current and prior period consolidated financial statements to reflect the necessary reclassifications. Additionally, we recorded a depreciation charge of $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. Gains on sale of real estate are recognized using the full accrual or partial sale methods, as applicable, in accordance with SFAS No. 66 Accounting for Real Estate Sales, provided various criteria relating to the terms of sale and any subsequent involvement with the real estate sold are met. Other Assets, Net. Other assets in our consolidated financial statements include investments under deferred compensation plans, deferred financing costs, non-real estate leasehold improvements and equipment, prepaid expenses, the value of in-place leases and related accumulated amortization, and other miscellaneous receivables. Investments under deferred compensation plans are held as trading securities and are adjusted to fair market value at period end. See further discussion of our investments under deferred compensation plans in Note 12. Deferred financing costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt on the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. Corporate leasehold improvements and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected useful lives or the lease terms which range from 3 to 10 years. Accumulated depreciation and amortization for such assets totaled $26.9 million in 2006 and $23.1 million in 2005. Insurance. Our primary lines of insurance coverage are property, general liability, health and workers compensation. We believe our insurance coverage adequately insures our properties against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood and other perils and adequately insures us against other risks. Losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience. Income Recognition. Our rental and other property income is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned. Other property income consists primarily of utility rebillings, and administrative, application and other transactional fees charged to our residents. Our apartment homes are rented to residents on lease terms generally ranging from 6 to 13 months, with monthly payments due in advance. Interest, fee and asset management and all other sources of income are recognized as earned. Two of our properties are subject to rent control or rent stabilization. Operations of apartment properties acquired are recorded from the date of acquisition in accordance with the purchase method of accounting. In managements opinion, due to the number of residents, the type and diversity of submarkets in which the properties operate, and the collection terms, there is no significant concentration of credit risk. Retail Lease Income. We have approximately 178,000 square feet of leaseable space for retail and commercial uses. Retail lease income is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including the construction period if we are determined not to be the owner of the tenant improvements. The difference between the cash received and income in any period is recorded as deferred retail lease receivable in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Any tenant incentives, also recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, are amortized over the related term of the lease, commencing the date we pay the incentive, as a reduction of retail lease income. Retail lease income for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $3.5 million which included a $0.3 million impact of recording the retail lease income on a straight-line basis. For retail leases outstanding as of F-9 Table of Contents December 31, 2006, minimum expected annual retail lease income for the years ending December 31, 2007 through 2011 are $3.3 million, $2.8 million, $2.6 million, $2.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and $2.2 million in the aggregate thereafter. Third-Party Construction Services. Our construction division performs services for our internally developed communities, as well as provides construction management and general contracting services for third-party owners of multifamily, commercial and retail properties. Income from these third-party projects is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis. For projects where our fee is based on a fixed price, any cost overruns, as compared to the original budget, incurred during construction will reduce the fee generated on those projects. For any project where cost overruns are expected to be in excess of the fee generated on the project, we will recognize the total projected loss in the period in which the loss is first estimated. See Note 9 for further discussion of our third-party construction services. Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)) requiring the compensation cost relating to share-based payments be recognized over their vesting periods in the income statement based on their estimated fair values. In April 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Shared-Based Payment providing for a phased-in implementation process for SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for all public entities in the first annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. The impact of adopting this pronouncement is discussed in Note 12, Share-based Compensation. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS No. 154). This pronouncement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and revises the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. This pronouncement also requires changes to the method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. SFAS No. 154 does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements, including those which are in a transition phase as of the effective date. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. EITF Issue No. 04-5 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls, and should consolidate, a limited partnership or a similar entity. EITF Issue No. 04-5 was effective after June 29, 2005, for all newly formed limited partnerships and for any pre-existing limited partnerships that modify their partnership agreements after that date. General partners of all other limited partnerships are required to apply the consensus no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-5 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 78-9-1, Interaction of AICPA Statement of Position 78-9 and EITF Issue No. 04-5. The EITF acknowledged the consensus in EITF Issue No. 04-5 conflicted with certain aspects of Statement of Position (SOP) 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. The EITF agreed with the assessment of whether a general partner, or the general partners as a group, controls a limited partnership should be consistent for all limited partnerships, irrespective of the industry within which the limited partnership operates. Accordingly, the guidance in SOP 78-9 was amended in FSP 78-9-1 to be consistent with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 04-5. The effective dates for this FSP are the same as those mentioned above in EITF Issue No. 04-5. The adoption of FSP 78-9-1 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FASB Interpretation (FIN) 46(R)-6, Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). FIN 46(R)-6 addresses how a reporting enterprise F-10 Table of Contents should determine variability associated with a variable interest entity or variable interests in an entity when applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) and is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2006. We will evaluate the impact of FIN 46(R)-6 at the time any reconsideration event occurs, as defined by the provisions of FIN 46(R), and for any new entities with which we become involved in future periods. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position, if the position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We have assessed the potential impact of FIN 48 and our adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement does not require new fair value measurements, but is applied to the extent other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements. The statement emphasizes fair value as a market-based measurement which should be determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. We will be required to disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the inputs used to develop the measurements, and the effect of certain of the measurements on earnings (or changes in net assets) for the period. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not anticipate the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), which requires an employer to recognize the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. SFAS No. 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. Our adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Reclassifications. In our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, we present separately income and expense on deferred compensation plans. In the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, we reclassified the income and expense on deferred compensation plans to be consistent with our 2006 presentation which resulted in a $6.4 million and $6.8 million increase to non-property income and to other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 3. Merger with Summit Properties Inc. On February 28, 2005, Summit Properties Inc. (Summit) was merged with and into Camden Summit Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (Camden Summit), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 4, 2004 (the Merger Agreement), as amended. Prior to February 28, 2005, Summit was the sole general partner of Summit Properties Partnership, L.P. (the Camden Summit Partnership). At the effective time, Camden Summit became the sole general partner of the Camden Summit Partnership and the name of such partnership was changed to Camden Summit Partnership, L.P. As of February 28, 2005, Summit owned or held an ownership interest in 48 operating communities comprised of 15,002 apartment homes with an additional 1,834 apartment homes under construction in five new communities. F-11 Table of Contents The aggregate consideration paid for the merger was as follows: (in thousands) Fair value of Camden common shares issued $ 544,065 Fair value of Camden Summit Partnership units issued 81,564 Cash consideration paid for Summit common shares and partnership units exchanged 458,050 Total consideration 1,083,679 Fair value of liabilities assumed, including debt 984,847 Total purchase price $ 2,068,526 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Summit stockholders had the opportunity to elect to receive cash or Camden shares for their Summit stock. Each stockholders election was subject to proration, depending on the elections of all Summit stockholders, such that the aggregate amount of cash issued in the merger to Summits stockholders approximated $436.3 million. As a result of this proration, Summit stockholders electing Camden shares received approximately .6383 of a Camden common share and $1.4177 in cash for each of their shares of Summit common stock. The final conversion ratio of the common shares was determined based on the average market price of our common shares over a five day trading period preceding the effective time of the merger. Fractional shares were paid in cash. Summit stockholders electing cash or who made no effective election received $31.20 in cash for each of their Summit shares. We issued approximately 11.8 million common shares to Summit stockholders. In conjunction with the merger, the limited partners in the Camden Summit Partnership were offered, on a unit-by-unit basis, the opportunity to redeem their partnership units for $31.20 in cash, without interest, or to remain in the Camden Summit Partnership following the merger at a unit valuation equal to .6687 of a Camden common share. The limited partner elections resulted in the redemption of 0.7 million partnership units for cash, for an aggregate of $21.7 million, and the issuance of 1.8 million partnership units. The value of the common shares and partnership units issued was determined based on the average market price of our common shares for the five day period commencing two days prior to the announcement of the merger on October 4, 2004. Revisions to the purchase price allocations during 2005 included reductions of $3.4 million due to the write-down of a property classified as held for sale which was sold in July 2005 and adjustments to retail lease commission balances, offset by increases of $3.9 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and $0.4 million to other minority interests. Revisions to the purchase price during 2006 included increases of $1.3 million to land and $0.7 million to properties under development, including land, as a result of purchase price adjustments primarily related to increases of $1.9 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities for litigation.
