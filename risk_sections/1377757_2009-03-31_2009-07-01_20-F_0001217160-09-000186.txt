Risk Factors Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below as well as the other information contained and incorporated by reference in this annual report. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of such risks actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and operating results could be materially adversely affected. A lawsuit has been commenced in Ghana wherein the plaintiff seeks to reclaim Keegan Ghanas interests in its principal mineral property, the Esaase Concession As more particularly described under Item 8.A.7 Legal Proceedings  Esaase Lawsuit, Sametro Company Limited (Sametro), a predecessor in interest of Keegan Ghana to the Esaase Concession, has commenced a lawsuit in Ghana seeking to recover Sametros interests in the Esaase Concession. While Keegan Ghana is confident in its legal position, lawsuits are inherently uncertain, an unfavourable ruling in the lawsuit could deprive Keegan Ghana of its most material asset, which would have severe adverse consequences on the value of the Company. Should Sametro succeed with the interlocutory application, Keegan Ghana would be required to halt exploration activities on the Esaase Property, delaying Keegans exploration program. Such delay could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Company. Current global economic conditions Recent market events and conditions, including disruptions in the international credit markets and other financial systems and the deterioration of global economic conditions, could impede the Companys access to capital or increase its cost of capital. Since 2007, the U.S. credit markets experienced serious disruption due to a deterioration in residential property values, defaults and delinquencies in the residential mortgage market and a decline in the value and credit quality of mortgage-backed securities. Other adverse events include delinquencies in non-mortgage consumer credit and a general decline in consumer confidence. These conditions worsened in 2008 and are continuing in 2009, contributing to reduced confidence in credit and financial markets around the world and the collapse of, and governmental intervention in, major financial institutions. Asset price volatility and solvency concerns have increased, and there has been less liquidity, a widening of credit spreads, a lack of price transparency, increased credit losses and tighter credit conditions. Notwithstanding various government actions, concerns about the general condition of the capital markets, financial instruments and financial institutions persist, and stock markets have declined substantially. 3 These market disruptions have had a significant material adverse impact on companies in many sectors of the economy and have limited access to capital and credit. These disruptions could, among other things, make it more difficult for the Company to obtain, or increase the Companys cost of obtaining, financing for its operations. Failure to raise capital when needed or on reasonable terms may have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment losses. If these factors continue, the Companys operations could be adversely impacted and the trading price of the Common Shares may be adversely affected. The Company is also exposed to liquidity risks in meeting its operating and capital expenditure requirements in instances where cash positions are unable to be maintained or appropriate financing is unavailable. These factors may impact the ability of the Company to obtain loans and other credit facilities in the future and on favourable terms. If these increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, the Companys operations could be adversely impacted and the trading price of the Common Shares could be adversely affected. Keegans mineral properties may not contain any ore reserves or any known body of economic mineralization. While there are bodies of mineralization on the Esaase Property, and although Keegan has completed core drilling programs within, and adjacent to, the deposits to determine measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources there are currently no known reserves or body of commercially viable ore and the Esaase Property must be considered an exploration prospect only. Extensive additional work will be required before Keegan can ascertain if any mineralization may be economic and hence constitute ore. Engineering, socioeconomic and environmental studies are ongoing. Exploration for minerals is a speculative venture necessarily involving substantial risk. If the expenditures that Keegan incurs on the Esaase Property do not result in discovery and development of commercial quantities of ore, the value of exploration and acquisition expenditures will be totally lost and the value of Keegan stock negatively impacted. Mineral Resources disclosed by Keegan for the Esaase Property are estimates only. Keegan has disclosed mineral resource estimates that have been made in accordance with NI 43-101. These resources estimates are classified as measured resources, indicated resources and inferred resources. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits classified as measured resources or indicated resources will ever be converted into ore reserves. Furthermore, inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economi cally or legally mineable. All amounts of mineral resources are estimates only, and Keegan cannot be certain that any specified level of recovery of metals from the mineralized material will in fact be realized or that the Esaase Property or any other identified mineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) ore-body that can be economically exploited. Mineralized material that is not mineral reserves does not have demonstrated economic viability. In addition, the quantity of mineral reserves and mineral resources may vary depending on, among other things, metal prices and actual results of mining. It is likely that Keegan will require significant additional financing in order to continue its exploration activities and its assessment of the commercial viability of the Esaase Property. Keegan will likely need to raise additional financing to fund the costs of developing the Esaase Property into commercial production if warranted. If the costs of Keegans planned exploration programs are greater than anticipated, Keegan may have to seek additional funds through public and private share offerings, arrangements with corporate partners, or debt financing. There can be no assurance that Keegan will be successful in its efforts to raise these required funds, or that it will be able to raise the funds on terms that do not result in high levels of dilution to shareholders. 4 Keegan has no earnings and may never achieve profitability or pay dividends. Keegan has a long history of losses and there can be no assurance that Keegan will ever be profitable or be able to secure funds to develop profitable mining operations. Keegan has paid no dividends on its shares since incorporation. Keegan presently has no ability to generate earnings as its mineral properties are in the exploration stage. If Keegan is successful in developing the Esaase Property, Keegan anticipates that it will retain cash resources for the future operation and development of its business. Keegan does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends is solely at the discretion of Keegans Board of Directors, which will take into account many factors including Keegans operating results, financial conditions and anticipated cash needs. For these reasons, Keegan may never achieve profitability or pay dividends. If price for gold declines, Keegan may not be able to raise the additional financing required to fund its exploration activities for the Esaase Property. The ability of Keegan to raise financing to fund its activities and, if warranted, development of the Esaase Property, will be significantly affected by changes in the market price of the metals it mines or for which it explores. The price of gold is volatile, and is affected by numerous factors beyond Keegans control. The level of interest rates, the rate of inflation, the world supplies of and demands for gold and the stability of exchange rates can all cause fluctuations in these prices. Such external economic factors are influenced by changes in international investment patterns and monetary systems and political developments. The price of gold has fluctuated in recent years, and future significant price declines could cause investors to be unprepared to finance exploration of gold. Compliance with environmental requirements will take large resources and changes to these requirements could significantly increase the costs to Keegan of developing the Esaase Property and could delay these activities. Keegan must comply with stringent environmental legislation in carrying out work on the Esaase Property. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Changes in environmental legislation could increase the cost to Keegan of carrying out its exploration and, if warranted, development of the Esaase Property. Further, compliance with new or additional environmental legislation may result in delays to Keegans exploration and, if warranted, development activities. Changes in government regulations and the presence of unknown environmental hazards on Keegans mineral properties may result in significant unanticipated compliance and reclamation costs. Government regulations relating to mineral rights tenure, permission to disturb areas and the right to develop and operate a mine can adversely affect the operations of Keegan. Keegan may not be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required to carry out exploration at our projects. Any changes in regulations or shift in political attitude are beyond the control of Keegan and may adversely affect its business. Keegan is subject to many risks that are not insurable and, as a result, Keegan will not be able to recover losses through insurance should such risks occur. Hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations and other conditions are involved in mineral exploration and development. Keegan may become subject to liability for pollution, cave-ins or hazards against which it cannot insure. The payment of such liabilities could result in a material adverse effect on Keegans financial position and its results of operations. Although Keegan maintains liability insurance in an amount which it considers adequate, the nature of these risks is such that the liabilities might exceed policy limits and the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable against. The market price of Keegans common shares is subject to high volatility and could cause investor loss. The market price of a publicly traded stock, especially a resource issuer like Keegan, is affected by many variables in addition to those directly related to exploration successes or failures. Such factors include the general condition of market for resource stocks, the strength of the economy generally, the availability and attractiveness of alternative investments, and the breadth of the public market for the stock. The effect of these and other factors on the market price of Keegans common shares suggests Keegans shares will continue to be volatile. Therefore, investors could suffer significant losses if Keegans shares are depressed or illiquid when an investor seeks liquidity and needs to sell Keegan shares. 5 Foreign Operations We have focused our operations on our Ghana properties. Nearly all mining projects require government approval regardless of the country. There can be no certainty that these approvals will be granted to us in a timely manner, or at all. The laws in foreign countries tend to differ significantly from North America and are subject to change. Mining operations, development and exploration activities are generally subject to extensive laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, production, exports, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, environmental protection and remediation, protection of endangered and protected species, mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. Mining is also subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production. The costs of discovering, evaluating, planning, designing, developing, constructing, operating and closing mines and other facilities in compliance with such laws and regulations are significant. Acquisitions of properties in foreign countries are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries. Some of these risks are more prevalent in countries which are less developed or have emerging economies, including uncertain political and economical environments, as well as risks of war and civil disturbances or other risks which may limit or disrupt a project, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property by nationalization or appropriation without fair compensation, risk of adverse changes in laws or policies of particular countries, increases in foreign taxation, delays in obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary governmental permits, limitations on ownership and repatriation of earnings and foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. In addition, we may face import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold, disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to Canadian and U.S. laws, including foreign corrupt practices legislation, restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore, and risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health issues. Although we are not currently experiencing any significant or extraordinary problems arising from such risks in the foreign country that we have properties in, there can be no assurance that such problems will not arise in the future. Competition We operate in a competitive industry and compete with other more well established companies which have greater financial resources than we do. We face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with exploration and the acquisition of properties producing, or capable of producing, base and precious metals. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than us. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to maintain or acquire attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all. Consequently, our revenues, operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect our financial position. We maintain most of our working capital in Canadian dollars or Canadian dollar-denominated securities. We convert our Canadian funds to foreign currencies as certain payment obligations become due. Accordingly, we are subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between Canadian dollar and these foreign currencies, and these fluctuations could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. A significant portion of the operating costs at Esaase and Asumura is based on the Ghanaian currency, the Cedi. 6 Gold exploration is highly speculative, involves substantial expenditures, and is frequently non-productive. Gold exploration, including the exploration of the Esaase Property and other projects, involves a high degree of risk. Exploration projects are frequently unsuccessful. Few prospects that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. We cannot assure you that our gold exploration efforts will be successful. The success of gold exploration is dependent in part on the following factors: • unanticipated adverse geotechnical conditions; • incorrect data on which engineering assumptions are made; • costs of constructing and operating a mine in a specific environment; • cost of processing and refining; • availability of economic sources of power; • availability of qualified staff; • adequacy of water supply; • adequate access to the site including competing land uses (such as agriculture and illegal mining); • unanticipated transportation costs and shipping incidents and losses; • significant increases in the cost of diesel fuel, cyanide or other major components of operating costs; • government regulations (including regulations relating to prices, royalties, duties, taxes, permitting, restrictions on production, quotas on exportation of minerals, as well as the costs of protection of the environment and agricultural lands); • fluctuations in gold prices; • accidents, labour actions and force majeure events; • the identification of potential gold mineralization based on superficial analysis; • availability of prospective land; • availability of government-granted exploration and exploitation permits; • the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise; and • the funding available for exploration and development. Substantial expenditures are required to determine if a project has economically mineable mineralization. It could take several years to establish Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves and to develop and construct mining and processing facilities. As a result of these uncertainties, we cannot assure you that current and future exploration programs will result in the discovery of Mineral Reserves, the expansion of our existing Mineral Reserves and the development of mines. Dilution through employee/director/consultant options could adversely affect Keegans stockholders. Because the success of Keegan is highly dependent upon its respective employees, the Company has granted to some or all of its key employees, Directors and consultants options to purchase common shares as non-cash incentives. To the extent that significant numbers of such options may be granted and exercised, the interests of the other stockholders of the Company may be diluted. There are 3,214,410 share purchase options outstanding as at March 31, 2009, which, if exercised, would result in an additional 3,214,410 common shares being issued and outstanding. (See Table No. 8 Stock Option Grants under Item 6.B Compensation). The risks associated with penny stock classification could affect the marketability of the common stock of Keegan and shareholders could find it difficult to sell their stock. Keegans stock is subject to penny stock rules as defined in 1934 Securities and Exchange Act rule 3a51-1. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Keegan s common shares are subject to these penny stock rules. Transaction costs associated with purchases and sales of penny stocks are likely to be higher than those for other securities. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than U.S. $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). 7 The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the Companys common shares in the United States and shareholders may find it more difficult to sell their shares. Keegan is dependent on key personnel and the absence of any of these individuals could result in the Company having to cease operations. While engaged in the business of exploring mineral properties, the nature of Keegans business, its ability to continue its exploration of potential exploration projects, and to develop a competitive edge in the marketplace, depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and maintain qualified key management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and the Company may not be able to attract and retain such personnel. Keegans growth will depend, on the efforts of its Senior Management, particularly its President, Daniel T. McCoy, its Chief Financial Officer, Tony Ricci, its Corporate Secretary, Michael Bebek and its Board of Directors that includes Richard Haslinger, Robert McLeod, Mark Orsmond, and Gordon Fretwell, in addition to Mr. McCoy. Keegan does not carry key-man insurance on any individuals. U.S. investors may not be able to enforce their civil liabilities against us or our directors, controlling persons and officers. It may be difficult to bring and enforce suits against Keegan. Keegan is a corporation incorporated in the province of British Columbia under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act. A majority of the Company's directors must be residents of Canada, and all or substantial portions of their assets are located outside of the United States, predominantly in Ghana and Canada. As a result, it may be difficult for U.S. holders of our common shares to effect service of process on these persons within the United States or to realize in the United States upon judgments rendered against them. In addition, a shareholder should not assume that the courts of Canada (i) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the United States, or (ii) would enforce, in original actions, liab ilities against us or such persons predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the United States. As a "Foreign Private Issuer, Keegan is exempt from the Section 14 proxy rules and Section 16 of the 1934 Securities Act Results in Shareholders Having Less Complete and Timely Data. The submission of proxy and annual meeting of shareholder information (prepared to Canadian standards) on Form 6-K results in shareholders having less complete and timely data. The exemption from Section 16 rules regarding sales of common shares by insiders results in shareholders having less data in this regard. 8
