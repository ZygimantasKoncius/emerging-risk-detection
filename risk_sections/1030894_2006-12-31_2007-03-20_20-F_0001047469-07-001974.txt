D. Risk Factors Our shareholders and prospective investors should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report. We have had significant restructuring charges and losses for several years and may experience restructuring charges and losses in future periods. We recorded losses in each of the last six years resulting primarily from restructuring charges and the write-down of goodwill, capital and intangible assets. These amounts have varied from period to period. In 2004, we also recorded a write-down of accounts receivable for one specific customer. We have undertaken numerous initiatives to restructure and reduce our capacity and cost structures in response to changes in the EMS industry and end-market demand, with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings in the future. We will continue to evaluate our operations and may propose additional restructuring actions in the future. Any failure to successfully execute these initiatives, including any delay in effecting these initiatives, can have a material adverse impact on our results. Furthermore, we may not be profitable in future periods. We are in a highly competitive industry which has resulted in lower prices, reduced gross margins, and loss of revenue or customers. We are in a highly competitive industry. We compete on a global basis to provide electronics manufacturing services and solutions to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the communications, computing, industrial and consumer markets. Our competitors include major domestic and foreign companies such as Flextronics International Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Jabil Circuit, Inc., Sanmina-SCI Corporation and Solectron Corporation, as well as smaller EMS companies that often have a regional, product, service or industry specific focus. In addition, original design manufacturers (ODMs), companies that provide internally designed products and manufacturing services to OEMs, continue to increase their share of outsourced manufacturing services across several markets and product groups, including notebook and desktop computers, personal computer motherboards, and consumer electronics such as cell phones. While we have not, to date, encountered significant direct competition from ODMs in the end-markets in which we participate, such competition may increase if our business in these markets grows, or if ODMs expand further into, or beyond, these markets. We also face indirect competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and prospective customers, as these companies could choose to manufacture products internally rather than to outsource to EMS providers. Some of our competitors have a greater production presence in lower-cost geographies, as well as greater manufacturing, financial, procurement, research and development and marketing resources than we have. Accordingly, our current or potential competitors may develop or acquire services comparable or superior to those we develop, combine or merge to form larger competitors, or adapt more quickly than we will to new technologies, evolving industry trends and changing customer requirements. Competition has caused and may continue to cause excessive pricing pressures, increased working capital requirements, reduced profits or loss of market share (from both program and customer disengagements), any of which could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, the EMS industry has excess manufacturing capacity and has seen increased competition from Asian competitors. This has exerted and will continue to exert additional pressures on pricing for components and services, thereby increasing the competitive pressures in the EMS industry. We may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, and the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on us. We are dependent on selected industries which are exposed to changes in conditions that can continue to adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. During the past few years, we have been negatively impacted by the reduced demand for technology capital goods and proprietary computing products. Our financial performance depends on our customers' viability and financial stability, and the end-market demand for our customers' products. A majority of our customer base, in turn, depends substantially on the recovery and growth in these industries. The communications and computing industries are characterized by rapid changes in technologies, increased standardization of technologies and shortening of product lifecycles. These industries have 6 experienced severe revenue erosion, pricing and margin pressures, and excess inventories during the past few years. More recently, some of our customers in the communications sector merged or were acquired by third parties that are not our customers. Future mergers and acquisitions could result in a decrease in demand from our customers or a loss of business to our competitors as customers rationalize their business and consolidate their suppliers. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we experienced unexpected volatility in demand from the telecommunications segment, driven primarily by the challenging end-market demand in North America, and from recent consolidations in the marketplace. We expect this volatility in demand to continue into 2007. We are dependent on a limited number of customers, primarily within the communications and computing markets, for a substantial portion of our revenue. A decline in revenue from these customers or a loss of a large customer could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our two largest customers in 2006 were Cisco Systems and IBM, each of which represented 10% of total 2006 revenue and in aggregate represented 20% of total 2006 revenue. Our top 10 customers in 2006 represented 59% of our total 2006 revenue. Our two largest customers in 2005 were Cisco Systems and IBM, each of which represented more than 10% of our total 2005 revenue and in aggregate represented 27% of our total 2005 revenue. Our top 10 customers represented 63% of our total 2005 revenue. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. To reduce this reliance, we have been targeting new customers in the industrial and consumer markets. Mergers among our customers or our customers' customers could increase concentration and/or reduce total demand as the combined entities rationalize their business and consolidate their suppliers. In addition, some of our customers in the computing and communications markets have, during the past several years, significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us. There is no assurance that present or future large customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce, or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us, any of which would adversely affect our operating results. Significant reductions in, or the loss of, revenue to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on us. Although we enter into master supply agreements with our customers, the level of business to be transacted under those agreements is not guaranteed. Instead, we bid on a project basis and typically have supply contracts or purchase orders in place for the project. We are dependent on customers to fulfill the terms associated with these orders and/or contracts. Inherent difficulties in managing capacity utilization and unanticipated changes in customer orders place strains on our planning and supply chain execution and may affect our results of operations. Our customers are increasingly dependent on EMS providers for new product introductions and rapid response times to meet changes in volume requirements. Most of our customers typically do not commit to firm production schedules for more than 30 to 90 days in advance and we often experience reduced lead-times in customers' orders. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenue can occur in the last month of the quarter and could be subject to change or cancellation that will affect our quarter-to-quarter results. Accordingly, we cannot always forecast the level of customer orders with certainty. This can make it difficult to order appropriate levels of materials and to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. In addition, customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, or delay production for a number of reasons. Furthermore, in order to guarantee continuity of supply for many of our customers, we are required to manufacture and hold a specified amount of finished goods in our warehouses for our customers. The uncertain economic condition of our customers' end-markets, intense competition with respect to some of our customers' products and general order volume volatility have resulted, and may continue to result, in some of our customers delaying or canceling the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them, and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, by a group of customers, or by a single customer whose production is significant to an individual facility would seriously harm results of that operation in that period. Such order changes could also cause a delay in the repayment to us for inventory expenditures we 7 incurred in preparation for the customer's orders or, in certain circumstances, require us to return the inventory to our suppliers, re-sell the inventory to another customer or continue to hold the inventory, any of which may result in our taking additional provisions for the inventory should it become excess or obsolete. Order cancellations and delays could also lower our asset utilization, resulting in higher levels of unproductive assets and lower margins. In some cases, changes in circumstances for a customer could also negatively impact the collectability of receivables or carrying value of our inventory for that customer. On other occasions, customers have required rapid and sudden increases in production, which have placed an excessive burden on our manufacturing capacity. Rapid changes in product ramps and/or the weakening financial condition or deterioration of any single customer's financial condition could prevent us from collecting receivables or realizing the value of inventory on hand. Any of these factors or a combination of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may encounter difficulties expanding and/or restructuring our operations which could adversely affect our results of operations. As we expand our business, enter into new market segments and products, or transfer our business from one region to another, we may encounter difficulties that result in higher than expected costs associated with our growth and customer dissatisfaction with performance. Potential difficulties related to our growth and/or operational restructuring could include: lack of trained personnel to manage the operations and customer contracts appropriately; maintaining customer, supplier and other favorable business relationships during a period of transition; effective training of staff to manage new customers and products; unanticipated disruptions in our operations which may impact our ability to deliver to the customer on time, to produce quality products and to ensure overall customer satisfaction; and losing programs and customers who reduce their business risk by resourcing or dual sourcing their business with us due to unforeseen disruptions in our operations. Any of these factors could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of growth in new markets or the benefits we expected to realize from our restructurings and could adversely affect our business and operating results. The complexity of moving our manufacturing base to lower-cost regions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Due to significant and severe weakness in technology end-markets over the past few years and the highly competitive nature of their businesses, our customers required more lower-cost solutions from their EMS providers in order for them to maintain sales and improve their financial performance. This environment resulted in an accelerated movement of our production from higher-cost regions such as North America and Western Europe to lower-cost regions such as Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. This accelerated move has had and could continue to have a negative impact on current and future results by increasing the risks associated with, among other things, transferring production to new regions where skills or experience may be more limited than in higher-cost regions, incurring higher operating expenses during the transition, incurring additional restructuring costs associated with, among other things, the decrease in production levels in higher-cost geographies and the risks of operating in new foreign jurisdictions. In certain situations, product transfers have, and may in the future, result in our inability to retain our existing business or grow future revenue due to potential execution problems resulting from significant headcount reductions, plant closures and product transfers associated with major restructuring activities. Restrictions on our ability to restructure quickly enough can delay the timing and affect the benefits we expect from our restructuring efforts. We have operations in multiple regions around the world. As a result, we are subject to different regulatory requirements and labor laws governing how quickly we are able to reduce manufacturing capacity and terminate related employees. These requirements are particularly stringent in Europe. Restrictions on our ability to close under-performing facilities have resulted in higher expenses associated with carrying excess capacity and 8 infrastructure while we were conducting our restructuring activities. The speed of our restructuring can also be impeded by delays in customers' agreement to the product transfers and volatility in our customers' demand which can prevent us from transferring products to our other facilities in a timely and cost-effective manner. Since the restructuring of our plants requires some of our customers to move their production from one of our facilities to another, customers have, and may in the future, use this opportunity to shift their production to competitors' facilities. Our results can be affected by limited availability of components. A significant portion of our costs is for the purchase of electronic components. All of the products we manufacture or assemble require one or more components that we order from component suppliers. In many cases, there may be only one supplier of a particular component. Supply shortages for a particular component can delay production and thus delay the revenue of all products that use that component or can cause price increases in the products and services we provide. In the past, we have secured sufficient allocations of constrained components so that revenue was not materially impacted. In addition, at various times there have been industry-wide shortages of electronic components. Such shortages, or future fluctuations in the cost of components, may have a material adverse effect on our business or cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period. Any failure to successfully manage our international operations would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. During 2006, approximately two-thirds of our revenue was produced from locations outside of North America. We also purchase material from international suppliers for much of our business, including our North American business. We believe that our future growth depends largely on our ability to increase our business and penetration with global OEMs and, as we describe above, to continue to shift production to lower-cost geographies. This international expansion has had and will continue to require significant management attention and financial resources. International operations are subject to inherent risks which may adversely affect us, including: labor unrest and differences in regulations and statutes governing employee relations; changes in regulatory requirements; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and support operations; changes in local tax rates and other potentially adverse tax consequences, including the cost of repatriation of earnings; burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including changing import and export regulations, which could erode our profit margins or restrict exports; adverse changes in trade policies between countries in which we maintain operations; political instability; potential restrictions on the transfer of funds; inflexible employee contracts that restrict our flexibility in responding to business downturns; and foreign exchange risks. We have either purchased or built manufacturing facilities in numerous countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, China, Singapore, India, the Philippines, Brazil, Mexico, the Czech Republic and Romania, and could be subject to the political, economic and legal risks associated with doing business in these countries. Each of these regions has a history of promoting foreign investment but has experienced economic and political turmoil and fluctuations in the value of its currencies in the recent past. There is a potential risk that economic and political turmoil may result in the reversal of current policies encouraging foreign investment and trade, 9 restrictions on the transfer of funds overseas, employee turnover, labor unrest or other domestic problems that could adversely affect us. We face financial risks due to foreign currency fluctuations. The principal currency in which we conduct our operations is the U.S. dollar. However, some of our subsidiaries transact business in foreign currencies, such as Canadian dollars, Thai baht, Euros, Mexican pesos, Czech koruna, Singapore dollars, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgits, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian reai, Philippine pesos, Romanian lei and Indian rupees. We often enter into hedging transactions to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risks. Our current hedging activity is designed to reduce the variability of our foreign currency costs and consists of contracts to purchase or sell these foreign currencies at future dates. These contracts generally extend for periods ranging from one to 15 months. Our hedging transactions may not successfully minimize foreign currency risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological changes which have an adverse impact on our business. Many of our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services. These conditions frequently result in short product lifecycles. Our success will depend largely on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products. If technologies or standards supported by our customers' products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, an accelerating decline in end-market demand in proprietary systems in favor of open systems with standardized technologies could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our investment in Lean and Six Sigma initiatives may not produce the anticipated cost benefits or achieve the working capital benefits we expect. We are continually investing in training, business process and information technology tools to eliminate waste, increase quality and reduce defects in the manufacturing process. This investment is critical in our industry, as our customers require us to continually produce cost savings through the elimination of waste and improved efficiencies. Failure to deliver these cost savings could affect our relationships with our customers in a manner which would adversely affect our volumes and operating results. The deployment of Lean and Six Sigma initiatives is part of the roadmap we are using to improve our own operating margin. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could have a negative impact on our margin improvement. Failure of our customers to pay the amounts owed to us in a timely manner may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We generally provide payment terms ranging from 30 to 60 days. As a result, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our customers, historically representing 22% to 39% of current assets. Accounts receivable from sales to customers at December 31, 2006 were $973.2 million (December 31, 2005  $982.6 million; and December 31, 2004  $1,023.3 million). At December 31, 2006, no customer represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable (December 31, 2005  one customer represented 12% of total accounts receivable; and December 31, 2004  two customers represented 25% of total accounts receivable). If any of our customers has insufficient liquidity, we may encounter significant delays or defaults in payments owed to us by customers, and may extend our payment terms or restructure the debt, which may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We regularly review our accounts receivable valuations and make adjustments when necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2006 was $21.4 million (December 31, 2005  $21.1 million; and December 31, 2004  $140.1 million), which represented 2% of the gross accounts receivable balance (December 31, 2005  2%; and December 31, 2004  12%). In 2004, the allowance for doubtful accounts included a charge of $116.8 million relating to one specific customer that ceased business in 2005. 10 We may encounter difficulties completing or integrating our acquisitions which could adversely affect our results of operations. Some of our growth may occur through acquisitions. These transactions may involve acquisitions of entire companies and/or acquisitions of selected assets from OEMs. Potential difficulties related to our acquisitions include: integrating acquired operations, systems and businesses; maintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations and restructuring or terminating unfavorable relationships; addressing unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses; losing customers who want to transfer their business because of the change in ownership; losing key employees of acquired operations; and not achieving anticipated business volumes. Any of these factors could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including operational synergies and economies of scale. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions could adversely affect our business and operating results. Implementation of a new information system could adversely impact our results. We currently have various instances of an Enterprise Resource Planning system in most of our manufacturing sites. We intend to install a single version of this system in most of our plants over the next two years. This new system will replace the current Enterprise Resource Planning system, and financial information systems. Our ability to properly implement this new information system could have a material adverse impact to our results. If our products or services are subject to warranty claims, our business reputation may be damaged and we may incur significant costs. In certain of our sales contracts, we provide warranties against defects or deficiencies in our products, services or designs. A successful claim for damages arising as a result of such defects or deficiencies, for which we are not insured or where the damages exceed our insurance coverage, or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied or limited and for which indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We conduct business operations in a number of countries, including countries where tax incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment or income tax rates are low. We develop our tax position based upon the anticipated nature and structure of our business and the tax laws, administrative practices and judicial decisions now in effect in the jurisdictions in which we have assets or conduct business, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. We are subject to audits of historical information by local tax authorities which could result in additional tax expense in future periods relating to prior results. Any such increase in our income tax expense and related interest and penalties could have a significant impact on our future earnings and future cash flows. Certain of our subsidiaries provide financing, products and services to, and may from time to time undertake certain significant transactions with, other subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. In general, related party transactions, and in particular, related party financing transactions, are subjected to close review by tax authorities. Moreover, several jurisdictions in which we operate have tax laws with detailed transfer pricing rules which require that all transactions with non-resident related parties be priced using arm's length pricing principles, and that contemporaneous documentation must exist to support such pricing. 11 International taxation authorities could challenge the validity of our related party financing and related party transfer pricing policies. Such a challenge generally involves a subjective area of taxation and generally involves a significant degree of judgement. If any of these taxation authorities are successful in challenging our financing or transfer pricing policies, our income tax expense may be adversely affected and we could also be subjected to interest and penalty charges. In connection with ongoing tax audits in the United States, taxing authorities have asserted that our United States subsidiaries owe significant amounts of tax, interest and penalties arising from related party transactions. A significant portion of these asserted deficiencies were resolved in our favor in the fourth quarter of 2006. We believe we have substantial defenses to the remaining asserted deficiencies and have adequately accrued for any likely potential losses. However, there can be no assurance as to the final resolution of these remaining asserted deficiencies and any resulting proceedings, and if these remaining asserted deficiencies and proceedings are determined adversely to us, the amounts we may be required to pay may be material. Recently enacted changes and potential future changes in the securities laws and regulations have and can increase costs. In the United States, the U.S. regulators introduced the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. In Canada, Bill 198 was effective for 2006. These regulations have required us to change some of our corporate governance, securities disclosure and compliance practices. Compliance with these new regulations has increased our legal, financial and accounting costs, and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely. The efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected by any delay in delivery from our transportation suppliers, including delays caused by work stoppages and natural disasters. We rely on a variety of common carriers for the transportation of materials and products and for their ability to route these materials and products through various international ports. A work stoppage, strike or shutdown of any important supplier's facility or operations, or at any major port or airport, could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or expediting charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Natural disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes in the regions where our facilities or our suppliers' facilities are located, could have an adverse impact on our ability to deliver products to our customers. Such events could disrupt supply to us, and from us to our customers, and adversely affect our operations. The efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected by any disruptions from our third-party IT providers. We have outsourced certain IT systems support which include database management as well as application development support for our production control and inventory management systems. If these third-party providers are unable to fulfill their obligations on a timely and reliable basis, we may experience disruptions to our operations. Any inefficiencies or production down times resulting from these disruptions could have a negative impact on our ability to meet customers' orders, resulting in a delay or decrease to our revenue and our operating margins. If we are unable to recruit or retain highly skilled personnel, our business could be adversely affected. The recruitment of personnel in the EMS industry is highly competitive. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled executive, technical and management personnel. We generally do not have employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. To date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining executive, managerial and technical personnel; however, the loss of services of certain of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We may be unable to keep pace with technology changes. We continue to evaluate the advantages and feasibility of new manufacturing processes. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to: develop and market electronics manufacturing services that meet our customers' evolving needs; maintain technology leadership; and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in production, manufacturing and supply chain processes in cost-effective and timely ways. 12 Our manufacturing and supply chain processes, test development efforts and design capabilities may not be successful. We may be unable to protect our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others. We believe that certain of our proprietary intellectual property rights and information provide us with a competitive advantage. Accordingly, we have taken, and intend to continue to take, appropriate steps to protect this proprietary information. These steps include signing non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers, employees, and other parties, and implementing rigid security measures. Our protection measures may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our property or information. There is also a risk that infringement claims may be brought against us, our customers, or our suppliers in the future. If someone does successfully assert an infringement claim, we may be required to spend significant time and money to develop a manufacturing process that does not infringe upon the rights of such other person or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the owner. We may not be successful in such development, or any such licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could adversely affect us even if we are successful in such litigation. We may not be able to increase revenue if the trend of outsourcing by OEMs slows. Future growth in our revenue includes a dependence on new outsourcing opportunities in which we assume additional manufacturing and supply chain management responsibilities from OEMs. Our future growth will be limited to the extent that these opportunities are not available as a result of OEMs deciding to perform these functions internally or delaying their decision to outsource or our inability to win new contracts. Political pressure or negative sentiment by our customers' customers to the movement of production from the United States or the European Union to lower-cost geographies could also adversely affect the rate of outsourcing generally, or adversely affect the rate of outsourcing to EMS providers, such as Celestica, who have shifted substantial capacity to these lower-cost geographies. Acts of terrorism and other political and economic developments could adversely affect our business. Increased international political instability, evidenced by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks, enhanced national security measures, conflicts in the Middle East and Asia, strained international relations arising from these conflicts and the related decline in consumer confidence, may hinder our ability to do business. Any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. These events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and customer confidence and spending in particular, which in turn could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. The impact of these events on the volatility of the U.S. and world financial markets could increase the volatility of the market price of our securities and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers and suppliers. Our compliance with environmental laws could be costly. We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions. Our environmental approach and practices have been designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations in a manner consistent with local practice. Future developments and increasingly stringent regulations could require us to incur additional expenditures relating to environmental matters at our facilities. Achieving and maintaining compliance with present, changing and future environmental laws could restrict our ability to modify or expand our facilities or to continue production. This compliance could also require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses. Certain environmental laws impose liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on an owner, occupier or operator of real estate, even if such person or company was unaware of or not responsible for the presence of such substances. In addition, in some countries in which we have operations, 13 any person or company who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at such facility, whether or not the person or company owns or operates the facility. Some of our operating sites have a history of industrial use. Soil and groundwater contamination have occurred at some of our facilities. From time to time we investigate, remediate, and monitor soil and groundwater contamination at certain of our operating sites. In certain instances where soil or groundwater contamination existed prior to our ownership or occupation of a site, landlords or former owners have typically retained some contractual responsibility and liability for the contamination and its remediation. However, failure of such former owners or landlords to perform, as a result of financial inability, contractual limitations or otherwise, could result in our company being required to remediate such contamination. We have generally obtained environmental assessments, or reviewed recent assessments initiated by others, for most of the manufacturing facilities that we own or lease at the time we either acquired or leased such facilities. Our assessments may not reveal all environmental liabilities and current assessments were not available for all facilities. Consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware. In addition, ongoing clean up and containment operations may not be adequate for purposes of future laws. The conditions of our properties could be affected in the future by the condition of the land or operations in the vicinity of the properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks. These developments and others, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws, increasingly strict enforcement of environmental laws by governmental authorities, or claims for damage to property or injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health or safety impact of our operations, may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us. Global environmental legislation continues to emerge. These laws place increased responsibility and requirements on the "producers" of electronic equipment (i.e., the OEMs) and, in turn, their EMS providers and suppliers. On July 1, 2006, the European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) came into effect. As a result, the use of lead and certain other specified substances in electronic products is restricted in the European Union. Where appropriate, we have transitioned our manufacturing processes and interfaced with suppliers and customers to review and secure RoHS compliance. In the event we are not in compliance with the RoHS requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including fines and penalties, as well as liability to our customers. In addition, customers who were deemed exempt for certain substances, or beyond the scope of the legislation, are beginning to be impacted by the changing supply chain. In this respect, we may incur costs related to inventories containing restricted substances. There are also European Union requirements with respect to the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components. Under the European Union's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, compliance responsibility rests primarily with OEMs rather than with EMS companies, other than products designed and owned by EMS companies. However, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations. Failure by our customers to meet the RoHS or WEEE requirements or obligations could have a negative impact on their businesses and revenue which would adversely impact our financial results. Similar restrictions are being proposed or enacted in other jurisdictions, including several states in the United States and in the Peoples' Republic of China. We continue to monitor other emerging environmental legislation, such as the European Union's Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) and Energy Using Product (EuP) directives, that may impact the industry going forward. We cannot currently assess the impact of these legislations on our operations. Our credit agreement, which matures in June 2007, and certain indentures contain restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to conduct our business. Our outstanding credit agreement, the indenture related to our 77/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and the indenture related to our 75/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (2013 Notes) contain financial and operating covenants that limit our management's discretion with respect to certain business matters. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt, create liens or other encumbrances, change the nature of our business, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, and merge or consolidate with other entities. At February 19, 2007, we were in compliance with these covenants. 14 At December 31, 2006, we were limited to approximately $60 million of available debt incurrence under our credit facility based on minimum financial ratios. Our credit facility will mature in June 2007. We are currently renegotiating the terms with the lender. These terms could impose additional restrictions on us. Although we expect to renew our credit facility, such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Based on our current operating needs and our cash on hand, we do not anticipate drawing on this facility in the near future. A reduction or cancellation of the facility is not expected to have a material impact on our liquidity. We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and to maximize yields without significantly increasing risk or materially restricting short-term access to cash. To achieve these objectives, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of securities, including government and corporate obligations, certificates of deposit and money market funds. As of December 31, 2006, our entire portfolio was scheduled to mature in less than three months. As a result, a 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolios. As of December 31, 2006, we had no cash equivalents that were subject to interest rate risk. The fair value of our cash equivalents approximated the carrying value as of December 31, 2006. In June 2004, we issued our 2011 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million bearing a fixed interest rate of 7.875%. We also entered into agreements which hedge the fair value of our 2011 Notes by swapping the fixed rate of interest for a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin, thereby subjecting us to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the LIBOR rate. The average interest rate on our 2011 Notes for 2006 was 8.2% (2005  6.4%) after reflecting the interest rate swap. A one percentage point increase in the LIBOR rate would increase our interest expense by $5.0 million annually. Shares eligible for public sale could adversely affect our share price. Future sales of our subordinate voting shares in the public market, or the issuance of subordinate voting shares upon the exercise of stock options or otherwise, could adversely affect the market price of the subordinate voting shares. At February 19, 2007, we had 198,607,563 subordinate voting shares and 29,637,316 multiple voting shares outstanding. All of the subordinate voting shares are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the U.S. Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates (as defined in the U.S. Securities Act). Shares held by our affiliates include all of the multiple voting shares and 2,167,361 subordinate voting shares held by Onex Corporation. An affiliate may not sell shares in the United States unless the sale is registered under the U.S. Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available. Rule 144 adopted under the U.S. Securities Act permits our affiliates to sell our shares in the United States subject to volume limitations and requirements relating to manner of sale, notice of sale and availability of current public information with respect to us. In addition, as of February 19, 2007, there were approximately 28,400,000 subordinate voting shares reserved for issuance under our employee share purchase and option plans and for director compensation, including outstanding options to purchase approximately 13,500,000 subordinate voting shares. Moreover, we may, pursuant to our articles of incorporation, issue an unlimited number of additional subordinate voting shares without further shareholder approval (subject to any required stock exchange approvals). As a result, a substantial number of our subordinate voting shares will be eligible for sale in the public market at various times in the future. The issuances and/or sale of such shares would dilute the holdings of our shareholders and could adversely affect the market price of the subordinate voting shares. The interest of our controlling shareholder may conflict with the interest of the remaining holders of our subordinate voting shares. Onex owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding multiple voting shares and 1.2% of the outstanding subordinate voting shares. The number of shares owned by Onex, together with those shares Onex has the right 15 to vote, represents 79.1% of the voting interest in Celestica and less than 1% of the voting interest in our outstanding subordinate voting shares. Accordingly, Onex exercises a controlling influence over our business and affairs and has the power to determine all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders where our shares vote together as a single class. Onex has the power to elect our directors and to approve significant corporate transactions such as certain amendments to our articles of incorporation, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and plans of arrangement in certain circumstances. Onex's voting power could have the effect of deterring or preventing a change in control of our company that might otherwise be beneficial to our other shareholders. Under our revolving credit facilities, it is an event of default entitling our lenders to demand repayment if Onex ceases to control Celestica unless the shares of Celestica become widely held ("widely held" meaning that no one person owns more than 20% of the votes). Gerald W. Schwartz, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Onex and one of our directors, owns shares with a majority of the voting rights of the shares of Onex. Mr. Schwartz, therefore, effectively controls our affairs. The interests of Onex and Mr. Schwartz may differ from the interests of the remaining holders of subordinate voting shares. For additional information about our principal shareholders, see Item 7(A), "Major Shareholders." Onex has, from time to time, issued debentures exchangeable and redeemable under certain circumstances for our subordinate voting shares, entered into forward equity agreements with respect to subordinate voting shares, sold shares (after exchanging multiple voting shares for subordinate voting shares), or redeemed these debentures through the delivery of subordinate voting shares and could do so in the future. These sales could impact our share price, have consequences on our outstanding debt, and change our ownership structure. We face securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs, diversion of management's attention and resources and negative publicity. We have been named as a defendant in class action lawsuits which assert claims for violations of federal securities laws on behalf of persons who acquired our securities between January 27, 2005 and January 30, 2007. Our former Chief Executive Officer and our current Chief Financial Officer were also named as defendants in these lawsuits. These lawsuits seek unspecified damages. Although we believe the lawsuits are without merit and we intend to defend these claims vigorously, these lawsuits could result in substantial costs to us, divert management's attention and resources from our operations and negatively affect our public image and reputation. Potential unenforceability of civil liabilities and judgments. We are incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. A significant number of our directors, controlling persons and officers are residents of Canada. Also, a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service within the United States upon those directors, controlling persons and officers who are not residents of the United States or to realize in the United States upon a judgment of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.
