ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Set forth below are risk factors relating to our business. You should also refer to the other information provided in this report, including our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as the information under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Risks Relating to Our Industry We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry. The insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, many of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do, as well as other potential providers of capital willing to assume insurance and/or reinsurance risk. We also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets. In our insurance business, we compete with insurers that provide specialty property and casualty lines of insurance, including ACE Limited, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd., American International Group, Inc., AXIS Capital Holdings Limited, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., Chubb Corporation, Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd., The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc., Lloyds of London, The St. Paul Travelers Companies, W.R. Berkley Corp., XL Capital Ltd. and Zurich Insurance Group. In our reinsurance business, we compete with reinsurers that provide property and casualty lines of reinsurance, including ACE Limited, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited, Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd., Everest Re Group Ltd., General Reinsurance Corporation, Hannover Rückversicherung AG, Lloyds of London, Montpelier Re Holdings Ltd., Munich Re Group, PartnerRe Ltd., Platinum Underwriters Holdings, Ltd., RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd., Swiss Reinsurance Company, Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. and XL Capital Ltd. We do not believe that we have a significant market share in any of our markets. Trends toward consolidation in the insurance industry could also lead to pricing pressure and lower margins for insurers and reinsurers. In addition, the impact of weather-related catastrophic events in the second half of 2005 has led to several newly formed offshore entities which have entered the insurance and reinsurance markets. Several publicly traded insurance and reinsurance companies have also raised additional capital to meet perceived demand in the current environment. Financial institutions and other capital markets participants also offer alternative products and services similar to our own or alternative products that compete with insurance and reinsurance products. In addition, we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the segments of the insurance and reinsurance market in which we operate. 37 Our competitive position is based on many factors, including our perceived overall financial strength, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, geographic scope of business, client relationships, premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the ability to design customized programs), speed of claims payment, reputation, experience and qualifications of employees and local presence. We may not be successful in competing with others on any of these bases, and the intensity of competition in our industry may erode profitability and result in less favorable policy terms and conditions for insurance and reinsurance companies generally, including us. The insurance and reinsurance industry is highly cyclical, and we expect to continue to experience periods characterized by excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates. Historically, insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions, changes in legislation, case law and prevailing concepts of liability and other factors. In particular, demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by the underwriting results of primary insurers and prevailing general economic conditions. The supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices and levels of surplus capacity that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return being realized in the insurance and reinsurance industry. As a result, the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels and changes in terms and conditions. We could face unanticipated losses from war, terrorism and political unrest, and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe that we do not have exposure to the events of September 11, 2001 because we did not have insurance in-force at that time with respect to exposure to such events, we now have substantial exposure to unexpected, large losses resulting from future man-made catastrophic events, such as acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. These risks are inherently unpredictable, although recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity of losses. It is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. In certain instances, we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from acts of terrorism. Even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us, we may not be successful in doing so. Moreover, irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language, there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or otherwise issue a ruling adverse to us. Accordingly, while we believe our reinsurance programs, together with the coverage provided under TRIEA, are sufficient to reasonably limit our net losses relating to potential future terrorist attacks, we can offer no assurance that our reserves will be adequate to cover losses when they materialize. To the extent that an act of terrorism is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, our U.S. insurance operations may be covered under TRIEA for up to 90% of its losses for 2005 and 2006 and up to 85% of its losses for 2007, in each case subject to certain mandatory deductibles. It is not possible to eliminate completely our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events, and to the extent that losses from such risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The insurance and reinsurance industry is subject to regulatory and legislative initiatives or proposals from time to time which could adversely affect our business. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance and reinsurance industry. Among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current 38 system of state regulation of insurers. There are a variety of proposals being considered by various state legislatures. We are unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted, the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted, or the effect, if any, these developments would have on our operations and financial condition. A recent legislative initiative was enacted in Florida in January 2007. This legislation doubles the aggregate reinsurance capacity of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (the FHCF), the reinsurance facility established by the state, and also reduces the industry loss retention level. In addition, the legislation adds coverage above and below the existing FHCF program during the 2007 to 2009 hurricane seasons. Under this legislation, the state-run insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, will also increase its underwriting capacity and have greater freedom to charge lower rates. The capacity extension and lower retention levels will lead to an increase in government-sponsored entities share of Floridas property catastrophe reinsurance market. Although we expect that reinsurance pricing in Florida may decrease as a result of this legislation, we do not believe that this will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition given our portfolio of business. We believe that rates in the worldwide insurance and reinsurance property and other markets may decrease due to the redirection of the capital that previously supported Florida property business, as this capital may be used to target other exposures. In addition, our U.S.-based insurers will be subject to additional assessments under this legislation. Claims for catastrophic events could cause large losses and substantial volatility in our results of operations, and, as a result, the value of our securities, including our common shares and preferred shares, may fluctuate widely. We have large aggregate exposures to natural disasters. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, tornados, explosions, severe winter weather, fires and other natural disasters. Catastrophes can also cause losses in non-property business such as workers compensation or general liability. In addition to the nature of the property business, we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property, including inflation, property value appreciation and geographic concentration tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time. Our previously disclosed estimates relating to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and other catastrophic events that occurred in the second half of 2005 are based on currently available information derived from modeling techniques, industry assessments of exposure, claims information obtained from our clients and brokers to date and a review of our in-force contracts. Our actual losses from these events, as well as any additional catastrophic events which may occur, may vary materially from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations resulting from several factors, including the preliminary nature of the available information, the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques, the contingent nature of business interruption exposures, the effects of any resultant demand surge on claims activity and attendant coverage issues. In addition, actual losses may increase if our reinsurers dispute or fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance protections purchased by us are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable. The weather-related catastrophic events that occurred in the second half of 2005 have resulted in a substantial improvement in current market conditions in property and certain marine lines of business. In order to take advantage of these current opportunities, we have increased our writings in certain property and marine lines of business and, as a result, these lines represent a larger proportion of our overall book of business in 2006 and may continue to represent a larger portion of our overall book of business in future periods. In addition, over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of 39 the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. Furthermore, some experts have attributed the recent high incidence of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean to a permanent change in weather patterns resulting from rising surface ocean temperature in the region (the warm ocean theory). Therefore, claims for catastrophic events could expose us to large losses and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations, which could cause the value of our securities, including our common shares and preferred shares, to fluctuate widely. Underwriting claims and reserving for losses are based on probabilities and related modeling, which are subject to inherent uncertainties. Our success is dependent upon our ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses that we insure and reinsure. We establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred. We utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of loss reserves. Actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid will deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. If our loss reserves are determined to be inadequate, we will be required to increase loss reserves at the time of such determination with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency becomes known. It is possible that claims in respect of events that have occurred could exceed our claim reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, in a particular period, or our financial condition in general. As a compounding factor, although most insurance contracts have policy limits, the nature of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance is such that losses can exceed policy limits for a variety of reasons and could significantly exceed the premiums received on the underlying policies, thereby further adversely affecting our financial condition. As of December 31, 2006, our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, were approximately $4.91 billion. Such reserves were established in accordance with applicable insurance laws and GAAP. Although we believe we have applied a conservative reserving philosophy for both our insurance and reinsurance operations, loss reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty. In establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, we have made various assumptions relating to the pricing of our reinsurance contracts and insurance policies and have also considered available historical industry experience and current industry conditions. Any estimates and assumptions made as part of the reserving process could prove to be inaccurate due to several factors, including the fact that limited historical information has been reported to us through December 31, 2006. The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We have large aggregate exposures to natural and man-made catastrophic events. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and fires. Catastrophes can also cause losses in non-property business such as workers compensation or general liability. In addition to the nature of property business, we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property, including inflation, property value appreciation and geographic concentration, tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time. We have substantial exposure to unexpected, large losses resulting from future man-made catastrophic events, such as acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. These risks are inherently unpredictable and recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity of losses. It is difficult to 40 predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. It is not possible to eliminate completely our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events and, to the extent that losses from such risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Therefore, claims for natural and man-made catastrophic events could expose us to large losses and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations, which could cause the value of our common shares to fluctuate widely. In certain instances, we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from terrorism. Even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us, we may not be successful in doing so. Moreover, irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language, there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or otherwise issue a ruling adverse to us. We seek to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis, adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written in defined geographical zones, limiting program size for each client and prudent underwriting of each program written. In the case of proportional treaties, we may seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one or series of events. In our insurance operations, we seek to limit our exposure through the purchase of reinsurance. We cannot be certain that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective. We also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification. Geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zones limits. There can be no assurance that various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum, will be enforceable in the manner we intend. Disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise. Underwriting is inherently a matter of judgment, involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. One or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations, possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity. For our natural catastrophe exposed business, we seek to limit the amount of exposure we will assume from any one insured or reinsured and the amount of the exposure to catastrophe losses in any geographic zone. We monitor our exposure to catastrophic events, including earthquake and wind and periodically reevaluate the estimated probable maximum pre-tax loss for such exposures. Our estimated probable maximum pre-tax loss is determined through the use of modeling techniques, but such estimate does not represent our total potential loss for such exposures. We seek to limit the probable maximum pre-tax loss to a specific level for severe catastrophic events. Currently, we generally seek to limit the probable maximum pre-tax loss to approximately 25% of total shareholders equity for a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone that could be expected to occur once in every 250 years, although we reserve the right to change this threshold at any time. There can be no assurances that we will not suffer pre-tax losses greater than 25% of our total shareholders equity from one or more catastrophic events due to several factors, including the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques or as a result of a decision to change the percentage of shareholders equity exposed to a single catastrophic event. In addition, depending on business opportunities and the mix of business that may comprise our insurance and reinsurance portfolio, we may seek to adjust our self-imposed limitations on probable maximum pre-tax loss for catastrophe exposed business. 41 The risk associated with reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us, and while reinsurance and retrocessional coverage will be used to limit our exposure to risks, the availability of such arrangements may be limited, and counterparty credit and other risks associated with our reinsurance arrangements may result in losses which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Like other reinsurers, our reinsurance group does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under reinsurance treaties. Therefore, we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies. We are subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume. For the purposes of managing risk, we use reinsurance and also may use retrocessional arrangements. In the normal course of business, our insurance subsidiaries cede a substantial portion of their premiums through pro rata, excess of loss and facultative reinsurance agreements. Our reinsurance subsidiaries purchase a limited amount of retrocessional coverage as part of their aggregate risk management program. In addition, our reinsurance subsidiaries participate in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain pro rata treaties. Such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all companies participating on such treaties, including the reinsurers, such as our reinsurance subsidiaries, and the ceding company. For the year ended December 31, 2006, ceded premiums written represented approximately 29.5% of gross premiums written, compared to 21.8% and 18.8%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions, which are beyond our control. Although we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have been successful in obtaining reinsurance protection since the commencement of our underwriting initiative in October 2001, it is not certain that we will be able to continue to obtain adequate protection at cost effective levels. As a result of such market conditions and other factors, we may not be able successfully to mitigate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements. Further, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance and retrocessions because the ceding of risk to reinsurers and retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure or reinsure. Our losses for a given event or occurrence may increase if our reinsurers or retrocessionaires dispute or fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance or retrocessional protections purchased by us are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable for any reason. Our failure to establish adequate reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our existing reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place coverages only with carriers we view as substantial and financially sound. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately 92.3% and 92.6%, respectively, of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses (not including prepaid reinsurance premiums) of $1.67 billion and $1.47 billion, respectively, were due from carriers which had an A.M. Best rating of A- or better. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the largest reinsurance recoverables from any one carrier were less than 5.1% and 5.6%, respectively, of our total shareholders equity. In connection with our acquisition of Arch Specialty in February 2002, the seller, Sentry Insurance a Mutual Company (Sentry), agreed to reinsure and guarantee all liabilities arising out of Arch Specialtys business prior to the closing of the acquisition. In addition to the guarantee provided by Sentry, substantially all of the recoverable from Sentry is still subject to the original reinsurance agreements inuring to Arch Specialty and, to the extent Sentry fails to comply with its payment obligations to us, we may obtain reimbursement from the third party reinsures under such agreements. 42 Our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk. In accordance with industry practice, we generally pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us. In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such payment, we may remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for the deficiency. Likewise, in certain jurisdictions, when the insured or ceding company pays premium for these contracts to brokers for payment to us, these premiums are considered to have been paid and the insured or ceding company will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the broker. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with our brokers. To date, we have not experienced any losses related to this credit risk. We cannot predict the effect that the investigation currently being conducted by the New York Attorney General and others will have on the industry or our business, and the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and certain proposed legislation are uncertain. The New York Attorney General and others are investigating allegations relating to contingent commission payments, bid-rigging and other practices in the insurance industry. We cannot predict the effect that these investigations, and any changes in insurance practice, including future legislation or regulations that may become applicable to us, will have on the insurance industry, the regulatory framework or our business. The effects of emerging claims and coverage issues are uncertain. The insurance industry is also affected by political, judicial and legal developments which have in the past resulted in new or expanded theories of liability. These or other changes could impose new financial obligations on us by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or otherwise require us to make unplanned modifications to the products and services that we provide, or cause the delay or cancellation of products and services that we provide. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. The effects of unforeseen developments or substantial government intervention could adversely impact our ability to achieve our goals. Risks Relating to Our Company Our success will depend on our ability to maintain and enhance effective operating procedures and internal controls. We continue to enhance our operating procedures and internal controls (including the timely and successful implementation of our information technology initiatives, which include the implementation of improved computerized systems and programs to replace and support manual systems, and including controls over financial reporting) to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions 43 about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As a result of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatement due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are met. A downgrade in our ratings or our inability to obtain a rating for our operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may adversely affect our relationships with clients and brokers and negatively impact sales of our products. Our operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are rated by ratings agencies. Brokers negotiate contracts of reinsurance between a primary insurer and reinsurer, on behalf of the primary insurer. Third-party rating agencies, such as A.M. Best Company, assess and rate the financial strength of insurers and reinsurers based upon criteria established by the rating agencies, which criteria are subject to change. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. Insurers and intermediaries use these ratings as one measure by which to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers and reinsurers. These ratings are often an important factor in the decision by an insured or intermediary of whether to place business with a particular insurance or reinsurance provider. Our financial strength ratings are subject to periodic review as rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet their criteria for ratings assigned to us by them. Such ratings may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of such ratings agencies in response to a variety of factors, including a minimum capital adequacy ratio, management, earnings, capitalization and risk profile. Although since the commencement of our underwriting initiative in October 2001 our ratings have not been downgraded, we can offer no assurances that our ratings will remain at their current levels. A ratings downgrade or the potential for such a downgrade, or failure to obtain a necessary rating, could adversely affect both our relationships with agents, brokers, wholesalers and other distributors of our existing products and services and new sales of our products and services. Any ratings downgrade or failure to obtain a necessary rating could adversely affect our ability to compete in our markets, could cause our premiums and earnings to decrease and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a downgrade in ratings of certain of our operating subsidiaries would in certain cases constitute an event of default under our credit facilities. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsContractual Obligations and Commercial CommitmentsLetter of Credit and Revolving Credit Facilities for a discussion of our credit facilities. The loss of our key employees or our inability to retain them could negatively impact our business. Our success has been, and will continue to be, dependent on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The pool of talent from which we actively recruit is limited. Although, to date, we have not experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining key personnel, the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel when available and the loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our underwriting staff is critical to our success in the production of business. While we do not consider any of our key executive officers or underwriters to be irreplaceable, the loss of the services of our key executive officers or underwriters or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could delay or prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy which could affect our financial performance. We are not aware of any intentions of any of our key personnel that would cause them no longer to provide their professional services to us in the near future. 44 The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments, which are even more difficult than those made in a mature company since limited historical information has been reported to us through December 31, 2006. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities (including reserves), revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, insurance and other reserves, reinsurance recoverables, investment valuations, intangible assets, bad debts, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience, where possible, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company, like our company, are even more difficult to make than those made in a mature company since limited historical information has been reported to us through December 31, 2006. Instead, our current loss reserves are primarily based on estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred but not yet reported. We utilize actuarial models as well as historical insurance industry loss development patterns to establish loss reserves. Accordingly, actual claims and claim expenses paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. The Warburg Pincus funds and the Hellman & Friedman funds together own approximately 31.7% of our voting shares, and these shareholders have the right to have directors on our board; their interests may materially differ from the interests of the holders of our other securities. The Warburg Pincus funds and the Hellman & Friedman funds own 25.4% and 6.3% of our outstanding voting shares, respectively, as of December 31, 2006. These shareholders are not subject to the voting limitation contained in our bye-laws. We have agreed (until 2011) not to declare any dividend or make any other distribution on our common shares, and not to repurchase any common shares, until we have repurchased from the Warburg Pincus funds and the Hellman & Friedman funds, pro rata, on the basis of the amount of these shareholders investments in us at the time of such repurchase, common shares (which were issued pursuant to the conversion of all of the outstanding preference shares in the 2005 fourth quarter) having an aggregate value of $250 million, at a per share price acceptable to these shareholders. No such shares have yet been repurchased. In addition, the Warburg Pincus funds and the Hellman & Friedman funds are entitled (until 2011) to nominate a prescribed number of directors based on the respective retained percentages of their equity securities purchased in November 2001. Currently, our board consists of ten members, which includes three directors nominated by the Warburg Pincus funds and two directors nominated by the Hellman & Friedman funds. As long as the Warburg Pincus funds retain at least 75% of their original investment and the Hellman & Friedman funds retain at least 60% of their original investment, these shareholders will be entitled to nominate six and three directors, respectively. Together they have the right to nominate a majority of directors to our board. By reason of their ownership and the shareholders agreement between us and the Warburg Pincus funds and the Hellman & Friedman funds, the Warburg Pincus funds and the Hellman & Friedman funds, individually or together, are able to strongly influence or effectively control actions to be taken by us, or our shareholders. The interests of these shareholders may differ materially from the interests of the holders of our other securities, and these shareholders could take actions or make decisions that are not in the interests of the holders of our other securities generally. 45 The price of our common shares may be volatile. There has been significant volatility in the market for equity securities. During 2005 and 2006, the price of our common shares fluctuated from a low of $36.56 to a high of $57.65 and from a low of $52.00 to a high of $70.59, respectively. On February 15, 2007, our common shares closed at a price of $66.01. The price of our common shares may not remain at or exceed current levels. The following factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock: · actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations, including as a result of catastrophes; · changes in market valuation of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry; · changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts; · fluctuations in stock market process and volumes; · issuances or sales of common shares or other securities in the future; · the addition or departure of key personnel; and · announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances. Stock markets in the United States often experience price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Our business is dependent upon insurance and reinsurance brokers, and the loss of important broker relationships could materially adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. We market our insurance and reinsurance products primarily through brokers. We derive a significant portion of our business from a limited number of brokers. During 2006, approximately 18.8% and 15.4% of our gross premiums written were generated from or placed by Marsh & McLennan Companies and its subsidiaries and AON Corporation and its subsidiaries, respectively. No other broker and no one insured or reinsured accounted for more than 10% of gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2006. Some of our competitors have had longer term relationships with the brokers we use than we have, and the brokers may promote products offered by companies that may offer a larger variety of products than we do. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by these brokers could have a material adverse effect on us. We could be materially adversely affected to the extent that managing general agents, general agents and other producers in our program business exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us. In program business conducted by our insurance group, following our underwriting, financial, claims and information technology due diligence reviews, we authorize managing general agents, general agents and other producers to write business on our behalf within underwriting authorities prescribed by us. Once a program incepts, we must rely on the underwriting controls of these agents to write business within the underwriting authorities provided by us. Although we monitor our programs on an ongoing basis, our monitoring efforts may not be adequate or our agents may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us. We have experienced breaches by certain of our agents, all of which have been resolved favorably for us. To the extent that our agents exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 46 Our investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business. Our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio. A significant portion of our cash and invested assets consists of fixed maturities (83.0% as of December 31, 2006). Although our current investment guidelines and approach stress preservation of capital, market liquidity and diversification of risk, our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations. In addition, although we did not experience any significant defaults by issuers during 2006, we are subject to risks inherent in particular securities or types of securities, as well as sector concentrations. We may not be able to realize our investment objectives, which could reduce our net income significantly. In the event that we are unsuccessful in correlating our investment portfolio with our expected insurance and reinsurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and ability to conduct our business. We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes. Our operating results are affected, in part, by the performance of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate-sensitive-instruments, such as bonds, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our investment income and results of operations. For example, if interest rates increase, the value of our investment portfolio may decline. In addition, our investment portfolio includes mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2006, mortgage-backed securities (excluding commercial mortgage backed securities) constituted approximately 12.7% of our cash and invested assets. As with other fixed income investments, the fair value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment. Changes in interest rates can expose us to prepayment risks on these investments. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities are prepaid more quickly, requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Although we attempt to take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively. Despite our mitigation efforts, an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our book value. We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms. We monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis. The capital requirements of our business depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. Our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. To the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements and/or cover claim losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are unfavorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result, and, in any case, such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities. If we are not able to obtain adequate capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. 47 We sold our prior reinsurance operations in May 2000 and may have liability to the purchaser and continuing liability from those reinsurance operations if the purchaser should fail to make payments on the reinsurance liabilities it assumed. On May 5, 2000, we sold our prior reinsurance operations to Folksamerica Reinsurance Company (Folksamerica). The Folksamerica transaction was structured as a transfer and assumption agreement (and not reinsurance), and, accordingly, the loss reserves (and any related reinsurance recoverables) relating to the transferred business are not included as assets or liabilities on our balance sheet. In addition, in connection with that asset sale, we made extensive representations and warranties about us and our reinsurance operations, some of which survived the closing of the asset sale. Breach of these representations and warranties could result in liability to us. In the event that Folksamerica refuses or is unable to make payment for reserved losses transferred to it by us in the May 2000 sale and the notice given to reinsureds is found not to be an effective release by such reinsureds, we would be liable for such claims. In June 2006, A.M. Best Company downgraded the financial strength rating of Folksamerica to A- (Excellent) from A (Excellent). Folksamerica reported policyholders surplus of $1.12 billion at September 30, 2006. We sold our non-standard automobile insurance operations and merchant banking operations in 2004 and may have liability to the purchasers. In 2004, we sold our non-standard automobile insurance operations and merchant banking operations to third party purchasers. In connection with such sales, we made representations and warranties about us and our transferred businesses, some of which survived the closing of such sales. Breach of these representations and warranties could result in liability to us. Any future acquisitions may expose us to operational risks. We may in the future make strategic acquisitions, either of other companies or selected blocks of business. Any future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including: · integrating financial and operational reporting systems; · establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls; · funding increased capital needs and overhead expenses; · obtaining management personnel required for expanded operations; · funding cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated sales and revenues are not realized or are delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties; · the value of assets acquired may be lower than expected or may diminish due to credit defaults or changes in interest rates and liabilities assumed may be greater than expected; · the assets and liabilities we may acquire may be subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation; and · financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification, reinsurance and other obligations to us. Our failure to manage successfully these operational challenges and risks may impact our results of operations. 48 Some of the provisions of our bye-laws and our shareholders agreement may have the effect of hindering, delaying or preventing third party takeovers or changes in management initiated by shareholders. These provisions may also prevent our shareholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover. Some provisions of our bye-laws could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or changes in management initiated by shareholders. These provisions may encourage companies interested in acquiring the Company to negotiate in advance with our board of directors, since the board has the authority to overrule the operation of several of the limitations. Among other things, our bye-laws provide: · for a classified board of directors, in which the directors of the class elected at each annual general meeting holds office for a term of three years, with the term of each class expiring at successive annual general meetings of shareholders; · that the number of directors is determined by the board from time to time by a vote of the majority of our board; · that directors may only be removed for cause, and cause removal shall be deemed to exist only if the director whose removal is proposed has been convicted of a felony or been found by a court to be liable for gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duties; · that our board has the right to fill vacancies, including vacancies created by an expansion of the board; · for limitations on shareholders right to call special general meetings and to raise proposals or nominate directors at general meetings; and · that shareholders may act by written consent only if such consent is unanimous among all shareholders entitled to vote. Our bye-laws provide that certain provisions which may have anti-takeover effects may be repealed or altered only with prior board approval and upon the affirmative vote of holders of shares representing at least 65% of the total voting power of our shares entitled generally to vote at an election of directors. The bye-laws also contain a provision limiting the rights of any U.S. person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code)), that owns shares of ACGL, directly, indirectly or constructively (within the meaning of section 958 of the Code), representing more than 9.9% of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. The votes conferred by such shares of such U.S. person will be reduced by whatever amount is necessary so that after any such reduction the votes conferred by the shares of such person will constitute 9.9% of the total voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. Notwithstanding this provision, the board may make such final adjustments to the aggregate number of votes conferred by the shares of any U.S. person that the board considers fair and reasonable in all circumstances to ensure that such votes represent 9.9% of the aggregate voting power of the votes conferred by all shares of ACGL entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. ACGL will assume that all shareholders (other than the Warburg Pincus funds and the Hellman & Friedman funds) are U.S. persons unless we receive assurance satisfactory to us that they are not U.S. persons. Moreover, most states, including states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, have laws and regulations that require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurer or an insurers holding company. Where such laws apply to us and our subsidiaries, there can be no effective change in our control unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement with the regulators and has obtained prior approval for the proposed change from such regulators. The usual measure for a presumptive change 49 in control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting power of the insurance company or its parent, although this presumption is rebuttable. Consequently, a person may not acquire 10% or more of our common shares without the prior approval of insurance regulators in the state in which our subsidiaries are domiciled. The bye-laws also provide that the affirmative vote of 80% of our outstanding shares (including a majority of the outstanding shares held by shareholders other than holders (and such holders affiliates) of 10% or more (10% holders) of the outstanding shares) shall be required (the extraordinary vote) for the following corporate actions: · merger or consolidation of the Company into a 10% holder; · sale of any or all of our assets to a 10% holder; · the issuance of voting securities to a 10% holder; or · amendment of these provisions; provided, however, the extraordinary vote will not apply to any transaction approved by the board, so long as a majority of those board members voting in favor of the transaction were duly elected and acting members of the board prior to the time the 10% holder became a 10% holder. The provisions described above may have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties. To the extent that these effects occur, shareholders could be deprived of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares and the market price of their shares could be depressed. In addition, these provisions could also result in the entrenchment of incumbent management. Our operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in various jurisdictions, and material changes in the regulation of their operations could adversely affect our results of operations. Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to government regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed or authorized to do business. Governmental agencies have broad administrative power to regulate many aspects of the insurance business, which may include trade and claim practices, accounting methods, premium rates, marketing practices, claims practices, advertising, policy forms, and capital adequacy. These agencies are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders. Moreover, insurance laws and regulations, among other things: · establish solvency requirements, including minimum reserves and capital and surplus requirements; · limit the amount of dividends, tax distributions, intercompany loans and other payments our insurance subsidiaries can make without prior regulatory approval; · impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments we may hold; · require assessments through guaranty funds to pay claims of insolvent insurance companies; and · require participation in state-assigned risk plans which may take the form of reinsuring a portion of a pool of policies or the direct issuance of policies to insureds. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) continuously examines existing laws and regulations in the United States. We cannot predict the effect that any NAIC recommendations or proposed or future legislation or rule making in the United States or elsewhere may have on our financial condition or operations. 50 Our Bermuda insurance and reinsurance subsidiary, Arch Re Bermuda, conducts its business from its offices in Bermuda and is not licensed or admitted to do business in any jurisdiction except Bermuda. Arch Re Swiss Branch conducts only reinsurance activities and is therefore not required to be licensed by the Swiss insurance regulator authorities. We do not believe that Arch Re Bermuda is subject to the insurance laws of any state in the United States; however, recent scrutiny of the insurance and reinsurance industry in the U.S. and other countries could subject Arch Re Bermuda to additional regulation. Our U.S. reinsurance subsidiary, Arch Re U.S., and our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, Arch Insurance, Arch Specialty, Arch E&S and Western Diversified, write reinsurance and insurance in the United States. These subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under state statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. Such regulation generally is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors. Arch-Europe, our European subsidiary, conducts its business from its offices in London and Germany. Arch-Europe is licensed to write insurance in the U.K., as well as several other European Union countries, and is subject to insurance laws in the U.K. and, to a limited extent, the other European Union countries where it writes insurance. Arch-Europe also has branch licenses to underwrite insurance in Italy and Spain. In 2006, Arch-Europe was approved as an excess and surplus lines insurer in seven states in the U.S. In addition, the Canadian branch of Arch Insurance writes insurance in Canada and is subject to federal, as well as provincial and territorial, regulation in Canada. Our U.S., Bermuda and U.K. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and the Canadian branch of Arch Insurance are required to maintain minimum capital and surplus as mandated by their respective jurisdictions of incorporation and, in some cases, by the jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries write business. Arch-Europe is required to maintain minimum capital surplus as mandated by the NAIC and certain states where it is approved as an excess and surplus lines insurer. All of our subsidiaries are currently in compliance with these capital and surplus requirements. We periodically review our corporate structure in the United States so that we can optimally deploy our capital. Changes in that structure require regulatory approval. Delays or failure in obtaining any of these approvals could limit the amount of insurance that we can write in the United States. If ACGL or any of our subsidiaries were to become subject to the laws of a new jurisdiction in which such entity is not presently admitted, ACGL or such subsidiary may not be in compliance with the laws of the new jurisdiction. Any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business, and could also result in fines and other sanctions, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. ACGL is a holding company and is dependent on dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries, which are subject to dividend restrictions, to make payments, including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses we may incur and any payments of dividends, redemption amounts or liquidation amounts with respect to our preferred shares and common shares. ACGL is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in our subsidiaries. Generally, ACGL depends on its available cash resources, liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from subsidiaries to make payments, including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses it may incur and any payments of dividends, redemption amounts or liquidation amounts with respect to our preferred shares and common shares. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, ACGL received dividends of $22.1 million, $22.1 million and $11.0 million from Arch Re Bermuda. Such amounts were used to pay interest on ACGLs senior notes. The ability of our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards. Under Bermuda law, 51 Arch Re Bermuda is required to maintain a minimum solvency margin (i.e., the amount by which the value of its general business assets must exceed its general business liabilities) equal to the greatest of (1) $100 million, (2) 50% of net premiums written (being gross premiums written by us less any premiums ceded by us, but we may not deduct more than 25% of gross premiums when computing net premiums written) and (3) 15% of loss and other insurance reserves. Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is not in compliance with its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio. In addition, Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial years statutory balance sheet) unless it files, at least seven days before payment of such dividends, with the Bermuda Monetary Authority an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins. In addition, Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited, without prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital, as set out in its previous years statutory financial statements. At December 31, 2006, as determined under Bermuda law, Arch Re Bermuda had statutory capital of $1.98 billion and statutory capital and surplus of $3.32 billion. Such amounts include interests in U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Accordingly, Arch Re Bermuda can pay approximately $830.9 million to ACGL during 2007 without providing an affidavit to the Bermuda Monetary Authority, as discussed above. Our U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries can pay approximately $117.5 million in dividends or distributions to Arch-U.S., our U.S. holding company, which is owned by Arch Re Bermuda, during 2007 without prior regulatory approval. Such dividends or distributions may be subject to applicable withholding or other taxes. Arch-Europe can pay approximately £4.5 million, or $8.8 million, in dividends to ACGL during 2007 without prior notice and approval by the FSA. In addition, the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could be constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies. Our ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. We believe that ACGL has sufficient cash resources and available dividend capacity to service its indebtedness and other current outstanding obligations. If our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary is unable to provide collateral to ceding companies, its ability to conduct business could be significantly and negatively affected. Arch Re Bermuda is a registered Bermuda insurance company and is not licensed or admitted as an insurer in any jurisdiction in the United States. Because insurance regulations in the United States do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless security is posted, Arch Re Bermudas contracts generally require it to post a letter of credit or provide other security. Although, to date, Arch Re Bermuda has not experienced any difficulties in providing collateral when required, if we are unable to post security in the form of letters of credit or trust funds when required, the operations of Arch Re Bermuda could be significantly and negatively affected. We may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Under current Bermuda law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains. Furthermore, we have obtained from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act, 1966, an assurance that, in the event that Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits, income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of the tax will not be applicable to us or our operations until March 28, 2016. We could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after that date. This assurance does not, 52 however, prevent the imposition of taxes on any person ordinarily resident in Bermuda or any company in respect of its ownership of real property or leasehold interests in Bermuda. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may adversely affect our financial results. We write business on a worldwide basis, and our results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the value of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The primary foreign currencies in which we operate are the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can reduce our revenues and increase our liabilities and costs. We may therefore suffer losses solely as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. In order to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, we have invested and expect to continue to invest in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Net foreign exchange losses, recorded in the statement of income, for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $23.9 million, compared to net foreign exchange gains for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $22.2 million. We hold investments in foreign currencies which are intended to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our net insurance liabilities. However, changes in the value of such investments due to foreign currency rate movements are reflected as a direct increase to shareholders equity and are not included in the statement of income. We have chosen not to hedge the currency risk on the capital contributed to Arch-Europe in May 2004, which is held in British Pounds Sterling. However, we intend to match Arch-Europes projected liabilities in foreign currencies with investments in the same currencies. There can be no assurances that such arrangements will mitigate the negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations, and we may suffer losses solely as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. From inception through December 31, 2006, and based on currency spot rates at December 31, 2006, Arch Re Bermuda has recorded net premiums written of approximately $560 million from Euro-denominated contracts, $380 million from British Pound Sterling-denominated contracts and $200 million from Canadian Dollar-denominated contracts. In addition, Arch-Europe writes business in British Pound Sterling and Euros, and the Canadian branch of Arch Insurance writes business in Canadian Dollars. Certain employees of our Bermuda operations are required to obtain work permits before engaging in a gainful occupation in Bermuda. Required work permits may not be granted or may not remain in effect. Under Bermuda law, only persons who are Bermudians, spouses of Bermudians, holders of a permanent residents certificate or holders of a working residents certificate (exempted persons) may engage in gainful occupation in Bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. Our success may depend in part on the continued services of key employees in Bermuda. A work permit may be granted or renewed upon showing that, after proper public advertisement, no exempted person is available who meets the minimum standards reasonably required by the employer. The Bermuda governments policy places a six-year term limit on individuals with work permits, subject to certain exemptions for key employees. A work permit is issued with an expiry date (up to five years) and no assurances can be given that any work permit will be issued or, if issued, renewed upon the expiration of the relevant term. We consider our key officers in Bermuda to be Constantine Iordanou, our President and Chief Executive Officer (work permit expires November 12, 2009), Marc Grandisson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Arch Worldwide Reinsurance Group (work permit expires May 12, 2010), John D. Vollaro, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (work permit expires July 25, 2010) and Nicolas Papadopoulo, President and Chief Executive Officer of Arch Re Bermuda (work permit expires March 31, 2010). We also have other key positions in Bermuda held by persons who hold work permits subject to renewal. If work permits are not obtained or renewed for our principal employees, we could lose their services, which could materially affect our business. 53 The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be difficult. We are a Bermuda company and in the future some of our officers and directors may be residents of various jurisdictions outside the United States. All or a substantial portion of our assets and of those persons may be located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon those persons or to enforce in United States courts judgments obtained against those persons. We have appointed National Registered Agents, Inc., New York, New York, as our agent for service of process with respect to actions based on offers and sales of securities made in the United States. We have been advised by our Bermuda counsel, Conyers Dill & Pearman, that the United States and Bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters and that a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would, therefore, not be automatically enforceable in Bermuda. We also have been advised by Conyers Dill & Pearman that a final and conclusive judgment obtained in a court in the United States under which a sum of money is payable as compensatory damages (i.e., not being a sum claimed by a revenue authority for taxes or other charges of a similar nature by a governmental authority, or in respect of a fine or penalty or multiple or punitive damages) may be the subject of an action on a debt in the Supreme Court of Bermuda under the common law doctrine of obligation. Such an action should be successful upon proof that the sum of money is due and payable, and without having to prove the facts supporting the underlying judgment, as long as: · the court which gave the judgment had proper jurisdiction over the parties to such judgment; · such court did not contravene the rules of natural justice of Bermuda; · such judgment was not obtained by fraud; · the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of Bermuda; · no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of Bermuda; and · there is due compliance with the correct procedures under Bermuda law. A Bermuda court may impose civil liability on us or our directors or officers in a suit brought in the Supreme Court of Bermuda against us or such persons with respect to a violation of U.S. federal securities laws, provided that the facts surrounding such violation would constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Bermuda law. Risk Relating to our Preferred Shares General market conditions and unpredictable factors could adversely affect market prices for our outstanding preferred shares. There can be no assurance about the market prices for any series of our preferred shares. Several factors, many of which are beyond our control, will influence the market value of such series of preferred shares. Factors that might influence the market value of any series of our preferred shares include, but are not limited to: · whether dividends have been declared and are likely to be declared on any series of our preferred shares from time to time; · our creditworthiness, financial condition, performance and prospects; 54 · whether the ratings on any series of our preferred shares provided by any ratings agency have changed; · the market for similar securities; and · economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events that affect us and/or the insurance or financial markets generally. Dividends on our preferred shares are non-cumulative. Dividends on our preferred shares are non-cumulative and payable only out of lawfully available funds of ACGL under Bermuda law. Consequently, if ACGLs board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) does not authorize and declare a dividend for any dividend period with respect to any series of our preferred shares, holders of such preferred shares would not be entitled to receive any such dividend, and such unpaid dividend will not accrue and will never be payable. ACGL will have no obligation to pay dividends for a dividend period on or after the dividend payment date for such period if its board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) has not declared such dividend before the related dividend payment date; if dividends on any series of our preferred shares are authorized and declared with respect to any subsequent dividend period, ACGL will be free to pay dividends on any other series of preferred shares and/or our common shares. In the past, we have not paid dividends on our common shares. Our preferred shares are equity and are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness. Our preferred shares are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, our preferred shares will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in our liquidation. As of December 31, 2006, our total consolidated long-term debt was $300.0 million. We may incur additional debt in the future. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict payments of dividends on our preferred shares. Additionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarily be payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred shares like our preferred shares, (1) dividends are payable only if declared by the board of directors of ACGL (or a duly authorized committee of the board) and (2) as described above under Risks Relating to Our CompanyACGL is a holding company and is dependent on dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries, which are subject to dividend restrictions, to make payments, including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses we may incur and any payments of dividends, redemption amounts or liquidation amounts with respect to our preferred shares and common shares, we are subject to certain regulatory and other constraints affecting our ability to pay dividends and make other payments. The voting rights of holders of our preferred shares are limited. Holders of our preferred shares have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting shareholders. The limited voting rights of holders of our preferred shares include the right to vote as a class on certain fundamental matters that affect the preference or special rights of our preferred shares as set forth in the certificate of designations relating to each series of preferred shares. In addition, if dividends on any series of our preferred shares have not been declared or paid for the equivalent of six dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, holders of the outstanding preferred shares of any series will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to our board of directors subject to the terms and to the limited extent as set forth in the certificate of designations relating to such series of preferred shares. 55 There is no limitation on our issuance of securities that rank equally with or senior to our preferred shares. We may issue additional securities that rank equally with or senior to our preferred shares without limitation. The issuance of securities ranking equally with or senior to our preferred shares may reduce the amount available for dividends and the amount recoverable by holders of such series in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of ACGL. A classification of any series of preferred shares by the NAIC may impact U.S. insurance companies that purchase such series. The NAIC, may from time to time, in its discretion, classify securities in insurers portfolios as either debt, preferred equity or common equity instruments. The NAICs written guidelines for classifying securities as debt, preferred equity or common equity include subjective factors that require the relevant NAIC examiner to exercise substantial judgment in making a classification. There is therefore a risk that any series of preferred shares may be classified by NAIC as common equity instead of preferred equity. The NAIC classification determines the amount of risk based capital (RBC) charges incurred by insurance companies in connection with an investment in a security. Securities classified as common equity by the NAIC carry RBC charges that can be significantly higher than the RBC requirement for debt or preferred equity. Therefore, any classification of any series of preferred shares as common equity may adversely affect U.S. insurance companies that hold such series. In addition, a determination by the NAIC to classify such series as common equity may adversely impact the trading of such series in the secondary market. Risks Relating to Taxation We and our non-U.S. subsidiaries may become subject to U.S. federal income taxation. ACGL and its non-U.S. subsidiaries intend to operate their business in a manner that will not cause them to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States and, thus, will not be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes (other than U.S. excise taxes on insurance and reinsurance premium and withholding taxes on certain U.S. source investment income) on their income. However, because there is uncertainty as to the activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the United States, there can be no assurances that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will not contend successfully that ACGL or its non-U.S. subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. If ACGL or any of its non-U.S. subsidiaries were subject to U.S. income tax, our shareholders equity and earnings could be adversely affected. Certain of our U.S. subsidiaries have been personal holding companies, but did not have undistributed personal holding company income. Congress has been considering legislation intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of Bermuda insurance companies and U.S. insurance companies having Bermuda affiliates, including perceived tax benefits resulting principally from reinsurance between or among U.S. insurance companies and their Bermuda affiliates. Some U.S. insurance companies have also been lobbying Congress recently to pass such legislation. In this regard, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) permits the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to re-allocate, re-characterize or adjust items of income, deduction or certain other items related to a reinsurance agreement between related parties to reflect the proper source, character and amount for each item (in contrast to prior law, which only covered source and character). The Jobs Act also eliminated the tax benefits available to a U.S. company that, after March 4, 2003, changed its legal domicile to a non-U.S. jurisdiction, a transaction commonly known as an inversion. We changed our legal domicile from the U.S. to Bermuda, but were not affected by the anti-inversion rule because our change in domicile occurred in November 2000. The Senate version of the Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007 would make the Jobs Act anti-inversion rule applicable retroactively to inversions that occurred after March 20, 2002. Although this modification would not affect ACGL, no 56 assurance can be given that the final 2007 bill will not make the Jobs Act anti-inversion rule applicable retroactively to inversions that occurred on an earlier date, in which case ACGL could be adversely affected. We also understand that hearings on corporate inversions might be held soon in the House of Representatives. Additional legislation, if passed, and other changes in U.S. tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof to address these issues could adversely affect us. U.S. persons who hold our common shares or preferred shares may be subject to U.S. income taxation at ordinary income rates on our undistributed earnings and profits. We believe that we and our non-U.S. subsidiaries currently might be controlled foreign corporations (CFCs), although our bye-laws are designed to preclude any U.S. person from adverse tax consequences as a result of our CFC status. We do not believe that we are a passive foreign investment company. Since these determinations and beliefs are based upon legal and factual conclusions, no assurances can be given that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a court would concur with our conclusions. If they were not to so concur, U.S. persons who hold our common shares or preferred shares may suffer adverse tax consequences. Reduced tax rate for qualified dividend income received by individuals and other non-corporate holders may not be available in the future. Dividends received by individuals and other non-corporate United States persons on our common shares or preferred shares in taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2010 may constitute qualified dividend income that is subject to U.S. federal income tax at the rate applicable for long-term capital gains, rather than the higher rates applicable to ordinary income, provided that certain holding period requirements and other conditions are met. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010, qualified dividend income will no longer be taxed at the rate applicable for long-term capital gains unless legislation is enacted providing otherwise. Our non-U.S. companies may be subject to U.K. tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies, other than Arch-Europe and Arch-U.K., should be resident in the U.K. for tax purposes or have a permanent establishment in the U.K. Accordingly, we do not expect that any companies other than Arch-Europe and Arch-U.K. should be subject to U.K. taxation. However, since applicable law and regulations do not conclusively define the activities that constitute conducting business in the U.K. through a permanent establishment, the U.K. Inland Revenue might contend successfully that one or more of our companies, in addition to Arch-Europe and Arch-U.K., is conducting business in the U.K. through a permanent establishment in the U.K. and, therefore, subject to U.K. tax, which could have a material adverse effect on us. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
