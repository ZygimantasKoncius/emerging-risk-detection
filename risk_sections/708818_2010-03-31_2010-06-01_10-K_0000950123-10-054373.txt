BUSINESS Company Overview Quality Systems, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is comprised of the QSI Dental Division, NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, Inc. (NextGen Division), including NextGen Sphere, LLC and Opus Healthcare Solutions, Inc., and Lackland Acquisition II, LLC dba Healthcare Strategic Initiatives (HSI) and Practice Management Partners, Inc. (PMP) (Practice Solutions Division) (collectively, the Company, we, our, or us). The Company develops and markets healthcare information systems that automate certain aspects of medical and dental practices, networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations (PHOs) and management service organizations (MSOs), ambulatory care centers, community health centers, and medical and dental schools. The Company also provides revenue cycle management (RCM) services through the Practice Solutions Division. The Company, a California corporation formed in 1974, was founded with an early focus on providing information systems to dental group practices. In the mid-1980s, we capitalized on the increasing focus on medical cost containment and further expanded our information processing systems to serve the medical market. In the mid-1990s, we made two acquisitions that accelerated our penetration of the medical market. These two acquisitions formed the basis for the NextGen Division. Today, we serve the medical and dental markets through our NextGen Division and QSI Dental Division. Business Segments Historically, the Company has operated principally through two operating divisions: QSI Dental Division and NextGen Division. Through our acquisitions of HSI and PMP in 2008, we continued to strengthen our RCM service offerings. During fiscal year 2010, as a result of certain organizational changes, the composition of the Companys NextGen Division was revised to exclude the former NextGen Practice Solutions unit and the Companys RCM entities (HSI and PMP), both of which are now administered and aggregated in the Companys Practice Solutions Division. Following the reorganization, the Company now operates three reportable operating segments (not including Corporate), comprised of the NextGen Division, the QSI Dental Division and the Practice Solutions Division. As a result, our fiscal year 2010 and 2009 results have been re-casted to reflect this change. The following table breaks down our reported segment revenue and segment revenue growth by division for the years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Segment Revenue Breakdown Segment Revenue Growth for the Year Ended March 31, for the Year Ended March 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 QSI Dental Division 5.9 % 6.5 % 8.6 % 8.1 % (1.2 )% (3.3 )% NextGen Division 79.4 % 83.1 % 91.4 % 13.6 % 19.6 % 21.3 % Practice Solutions Division 14.7 % 10.4 % 0.0 % 67.5 % N/A N/A Consolidated 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 18.9 % 31.6 % 18.7 % QSI Dental Division. The QSI Dental Division, co-located with our Corporate Headquarters in Irvine, California, currently focuses on developing, marketing and supporting software suites sold to dental and certain niche medical practices. In addition, the Division supports a number of medical clients that utilize its UNIX based medical practice management software product and Software as a Service, or SaaS model, based NextDDS financial and clinical software. The QSI Dental Divisions practice management software suite utilizes a UNIX operating system. Its Clinical Product Suite (CPS) utilizes a Windows NT operating system and can be fully integrated with the practice management software from each Division. CPS incorporates a wide range of clinical tools including, but not limited to, periodontal charting and digital imaging of X-ray and inter-oral camera images as part of the electronic patient record. The Division develops, markets, and manages our Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)/connectivity applications. The QSInet Application Service Provider (ASP/Internet) offering is also developed and marketed by the Division. 4 Table of Contents In July 2009, we licensed source code from PlanetDDS, Inc. that will allow us to deliver hosted, web-based SaaS model practice management and clinical software solutions to the dental industry. The software solution will be marketed primarily to the multi-location dental group practice market in which the Division has historically been a dominant player. This new software solution (NextDDS) brings the QSI Dental Division to the forefront of the emergence of internet based applications and cloud computing and represents a significant growth opportunity for the Division to sell both to its existing customer base as well as new customers. NextGen Division. The NextGen Division, with headquarters in Horsham, Pennsylvania, and significant locations in Atlanta, Georgia and Austin, Texas, provides integrated clinical, financial and connectivity solutions for ambulatory, inpatient and dental provider organizations. On August 12, 2009, we acquired NextGen Sphere, LLC (Sphere), a provider of financial information systems to the small hospital inpatient market. This acquisition is also part of our strategy to expand into the small hospital market and to add new customers by taking advantage of cross selling opportunities between the ambulatory and inpatient markets. On February 10, 2010, we acquired Opus Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (Opus), a provider of clinical information systems to the small hospital inpatient market. Founded in 1987 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Opus delivers web-based clinical solutions to hospital systems and integrated health networks nationwide. This acquisition complements and will be integrated with the assets of Sphere. Both companies are established developers of software and services for the inpatient market and will operate under the Companys NextGen Division. The NextGen Divisions major product categories include:  NextGen ambulatory product suite that integrates as one system to streamline patient care with standardized, real-time clinical and administrative workflow through the practice, which consists of: ○ NextGen Electronic Health Records (NextGenehr) to ensure complete, accurate documentation to manage patient care electronically and to improve clinical processes and patient outcomes with electronic charting at the point of care; and ○ NextGen Enterprise Practice Management (NextGenepm) to automate business processes, from front-end scheduling to back-end collections and financial and administrative processes for increased performance and efficiencies.  NextGen inpatient products that deliver secure, highly adaptable, and easy to use applications to patient centered hospitals and health systems, which consists of: ○ NextGen Clinicals, which resides on an advanced truly active web 2.0 platform  and is designed to initiate widespread work efficiency and communication, reduce errors and time-to-chart, and improve care; and ○ NextGen Financials, which is a financial and administrative system that helps hospitals significantly improve the smart operations and financial and regulatory management of their facilities.  NextGen Community Connectivity, which consists of: ○ NextGen Health Information Exchange (HIE), formerly Community Health Solution, to exchange patient data securely with community healthcare organizations; ○ NextGen Patient Portal (NextMD.com) to communicate with patients online and import information directly into NextGenehr; and ○ NextGen Health Quality Measures (HQM) to allow seamless quality measurement and reporting for practice and physician performance initiatives. The NextGen Division products utilize Microsoft Windows technology and can operate in a client-server environment as well as via private intranet, the Internet, or in an ASP environment. 5 Table of Contents Services provided by the NextGen Division include:  EDI services that are intended to automate a number of manual, often paper-based or telephony intensive communications between patients and/or providers and/or payors;  Hosting services that allow practices seeking the benefits of IT automation but not the maintenance of in-house hardware and networking;  NextGuard  Data Protection services that provide an off-site, data archiving, restoration, and disaster recovery preparedness solution for practices to protect clinical and financial data;  Consulting services, such as data conversions or interface development, that allow practices to build custom add-on features; and  Physician Resources services that allow practices to consult with the NextGen Divisions physician team. Practice Solutions Division. The Practice Solutions Division, with locations in St. Louis, Missouri and Hunt Valley, Maryland, focuses primarily on providing physician practices with RCM services, primarily billing and collection services for medical practices. This Division combines a web-delivered SaaS model and the NextGenepm software platform to execute its service offerings. We intend to transition our customer base onto the NextGen platform within the next two years. The Practice Solutions Division provides technology solutions and consulting services to cover the full spectrum of providers revenue cycle needs from patient access to claims denials. Practice Solutions Division revenue growth in both fiscal years 2010 and 2009 was impacted by the acquisitions of HSI and PMP in May 2008 and October 2008, respectively. On May 20, 2008, we acquired St. Louis-based HSI, a full-service healthcare RCM company. HSI operates under the umbrella of the Companys Practice Solutions Division. Founded in 1996, HSI provides RCM services to providers including health systems, hospitals, and physicians in private practice with an in-house team of more than 200 employees, including specialists in medical billing, coding and compliance, payor credentialing, and information technology. We intend to cross sell both software and RCM services to the acquired customer base of HSI and the NextGen Division. On October 28, 2008, we acquired Maryland-based PMP, a full-service healthcare RCM company. This acquisition is also part of our growth strategy for our Practice Solutions Division. Similar to HSI, PMP operates under the umbrella of the Companys Practice Solutions Division. Founded in 2001, PMP provides physician billing and technology management services to healthcare providers, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region. We intend to cross sell both software and RCM services to the acquired customer base of PMP and the NextGen Division. The three Divisions operate largely as stand-alone operations, with each Division maintaining its own distinct product lines, product platforms, development, implementation and support teams, sales staffing and branding. The three Divisions share the resources of our corporate office, which includes a variety of accounting and other administrative functions. Additionally, there are a small but growing number of clients who are simultaneously utilizing software or services from more than one of our three Divisions. We continue to pursue product and service enhancement initiatives within each Division. The majority of such expenditures are currently targeted to the NextGen Division product line and client base. Industry Background The turbulence in the worldwide economy has impacted almost all industries. While healthcare is not immune to economic cycles, we believe it is more resilient than most segments of the economy. The impact of the current economic conditions on our existing and prospective clients has been mixed. We continue to see organizations that are doing fairly well operationally; however, some organizations with a large dependency on Medicaid populations are being impacted by the challenging financial condition of the many state governments in whose jurisdictions they conduct business. A positive factor for U.S. healthcare is the fact that the Obama Administration is pursuing broad healthcare reform aimed at improving issues surrounding healthcare. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which became law on February 17, 2009, includes more than $20 billion to help healthcare 6 Table of Contents organizations modernize operations through the acquisition of health care information technology. While we are unsure of the immediate impact from the ARRA, the long-term potential could be significant. Moreover, to compete in the continually changing healthcare environment, providers are increasingly using technology to help maximize the efficiency of their business practices, to assist in enhancing patient care, and to maintain the privacy of patient information. As the reimbursement environment continues to evolve, more healthcare providers enter into contracts, often with multiple entities, which define the terms under which care is administered and paid. The diversity of payor organizations, as well as additional government regulation and changes in reimbursement models, have greatly increased the complexity of pricing, billing, reimbursement, and records management for medical and dental practices. To operate effectively, healthcare provider organizations must efficiently manage patient care and other information and workflow processes, which increasingly extend across multiple locations and business entities. In response, healthcare provider organizations have placed increasing demands on their information systems. Initially, these information systems automated financial and administrative functions. As it became necessary to manage patient flow processes, the need arose to integrate back-office data with such clinical information as patient test results and office visits. We believe information systems must facilitate management of patient information incorporating administrative, financial and clinical information from multiple entities. In addition, large healthcare organizations increasingly require information systems that can deliver high performance in environments with multiple concurrent computer users. Many existing healthcare information systems were designed for limited administrative tasks such as billing and scheduling and can neither accommodate multiple computing environments nor operate effectively across multiple locations and entities. We believe that practices that leverage technology to more efficiently handle patient clinical data as well as administrative, financial and other practice management data will be best able to enhance patient flow, pursue cost efficiencies, and improve quality of care. As healthcare organizations transition to new computer platforms and newer technologies, we believe such organizations will be migrating toward the implementation of enterprise-wide, patient-centric computing systems embedded with automated clinical patient records. Our Strategy Our strategy is, at present, to focus on providing software and services to medical practices, dental practices, hospitals, health centers, and other healthcare providers. Among the key elements of this strategy are:  Continued development and enhancement of select software solutions in target markets;  Continued investments in our infrastructure including, but not limited to, product development, sales, marketing, implementation, and support;  Continued efforts to make infrastructure investments within an overall context of maintaining reasonable expense discipline;  Addition of new customers through maintaining and expanding sales, marketing and product development activities;  Expanding our relationship with existing customers through delivery of add-on and complementary products and services; and  Continuing our gold standard commitment of service in support of our customers. While these are the key elements of our current strategy, there can be no guarantee that our strategy will not change, or that we will succeed in achieving these goals individually or collectively. Products and Services In response to the growing need for more comprehensive, cost-effective healthcare information solutions for medical practices, dental practices, hospitals, health centers, and other healthcare providers, our systems and services provide our clients with the ability to redesign patient care and other workflow processes while improving 7 Table of Contents productivity through facilitation of managed access to patient information. Utilizing our proprietary software in combination with third party hardware and software solutions, our products enable the integration of a variety of administrative and clinical information operations. Leveraging more than 30 years of experience in the healthcare information services industry, we believe we continue to add value by providing our clients with sophisticated, full-featured software systems along with comprehensive systems implementation, maintenance and support services. Any single transaction may or may not include software, hardware or services. NextGen Ambulatory Practice Management Systems. Our products consist primarily of proprietary healthcare software applications together with third party hardware and other non-industry specific software. The systems range in capacity from one to thousands of users, allowing us to address the needs of both small and large organizations. The systems are modular in design and may be expanded to accommodate changing client requirements. We offer both standard licenses and SaaS arrangements in our software offerings; although to date, SaaS arrangements have represented less than 5% of our arrangements. NextGenepm is the NextGen Divisions practice management offering. NextGenepm has been developed with a functionally graphical user interface (GUI) certified for use with Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating systems. The product leverages a relational database (Microsoft SQL Server) with support on both 32 and 64 bit enterprise servers. NextGenepm is a scalable, multi-module solution that includes a master patient index, enterprise-wide appointment scheduling with referral tracking, clinical support, and centralized or decentralized patient financial management based on either a managed care or fee-for-service model. The NextGenepm product is a highly configurable, cost-effective proven solution that enables the effective management of both single and multi-practice settings. NextGen Ambulatory Clinical Systems. The NextGen Division provides clinical software applications that are complementary to, and are integrated with, our medical practice management offerings and interface with many of the other leading practice management software systems on the market. The applications incorporated into our practice management solutions and others such as scheduling, eligibility, billing and claims processing are augmented by clinical information captured by NextGenehr, including services rendered and diagnoses used for billing purposes. We believe that we currently provide a comprehensive information management solution for the medical marketplace. NextGenehr was developed with client-server architecture and a GUI and utilizes Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows NT or Windows XP on each workstation and either Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows XP or UNIX on the database server. NextGenehr maintains data using industry standard relational database engines such as Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle. The system is scalable from one to thousands of workstations. NextGenehr stores and maintains clinical data including:  Data captured using user-customizable input templates;  Scanned or electronically acquired images, including X-rays and photographs;  Data electronically acquired through interfaces with clinical instruments or external systems;  Other records, documents or notes, including electronically captured handwriting and annotations; and  Digital voice recordings. NextGenehr also offers a workflow module, prescription management, automatic document and letter generation, patient education, referral tracking, interfaces to billing and lab systems, physician alerts and reminders, and powerful reporting and data analysis tools. NextGen Express is a version of NextGenehr designed for small practices. QSI Dental Division Practice Management and Clinical Systems. In fiscal year 2010, we began selling a hosted SaaS practice management and clinical software solutions to the dental industry. The software solution is marketed primarily to the multi-location dental group practice market for which the Division has historically been a dominate player. This new software solution brings the QSI Dental Division to the forefront of the emergence of internet based applications and cloud computing and represents a significant growth opportunity for us to sell both to our existing customer base as well as new customers. 8 Table of Contents In addition to the SaaS practice management offering, the QSI Dental Division also sells a character-based practice management system using the IBM RS6000 central processing unit and IBMS AIX version of the UNIX operating system platform. The hardware components, as well as the requisite operating system licenses, are purchased from manufacturers or distributors of those components. We configure and test the hardware components and incorporate our software and other third party packages into completed systems. We continually evaluate third party hardware components with a view toward utilizing hardware that is functional, reliable and cost-effective. In addition to the SaaS clinical offering, our dental charting software system, the CPS is a comprehensive solution designed specifically for the dental group practice environment. CPS integrates the dental practice management product with a computer-based clinical information system that incorporates a wide range of clinical tools, including electronic charting of dental procedures, treatment plans and existing conditions, periodontal charting via light-pen, voice-activation, or keyboard entry for full periodontal examinations and PSR scoring, digital imaging of X-ray and intra-oral camera images, computer-based patient education modules, viewable chair-side to enhance case presentation, full access to patient information, treatment plans, and insurance plans via a fully integrated interface with our dental practice management product and document and image scanning for digital storage and linkage to the electronic patient record. The result is a comprehensive clinical information management system that helps practices save time, reduce costs, improve case presentation, and enhance the delivery of dental services and quality of care. Clinical information is managed and maintained electronically thus forming an electronic patient record that allows for the implementation of the chartless office. CPS incorporates Windows-based client-server technology consisting of one or more file servers together with any combination of one or more desktop, laptop, or pen-based PC workstations. The file server(s) used in connection with CPS utilize(s) Windows 2000 or Windows 2003 operating system and the hardware is typically an Intel-based single or multi-processor platform. Based on the server configuration chosen, CPS is scalable from one to hundreds of workstations. The hardware components, including the requisite operating system licenses, are purchased from third party manufacturers or distributors either directly by the customer or by us for resale to the customer. NextGen Inpatient Solutions. NextGen inpatient solutions includes both clinical and financial applications to provide value based solutions for even rural and community hospitals to improve patient safety, automate order entry, and facilitate real-time communication of patient information throughout the hospital. NextGen inpatient solutions are highly scalable, secure and easy to use with a Web 2.0 based clinical component that leverages full cloud computing capabilities. Revenue Cycle Management Services. Our Practice Solutions Division offers RCM services to physicians. Our RCM service automates and manages billing-related functions for physician practices to help manage reimbursement quickly and efficiently. RCM services generally include:  Electronic claims submission service that submits Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant insurance claims electronically to insurance payers;  Electronic remittance and payment posting service that uses NextGen Document Management system to link an image of each explanation of benefit (EOB) to the corresponding encounter at the time of payment posting to minimizes the need for storage of paper EOBs; and  Accounts receivable follow-up methodology that allows practices to establish parameters, adjustment rules and standards for account elevation. Electronic Data Interchange. We make available EDI capabilities and connectivity services to our customers. The EDI/connectivity capabilities encompass direct interfaces between our products and external third party systems, as well as transaction-based services. EDI products are intended to automate a number of manual, often paper-based or telephony intensive communications between patients and/or providers and/or payors. Two of the more common EDI services are forwarding insurance claims electronically from providers to payors and assisting practices with issuing statements to patients. Most client practices utilize at least some of these services from us or one of our competitors. Other EDI/connectivity services are used more sporadically by client practices. 9 Table of Contents We typically compete to displace incumbent vendors for claims and statements accounts and attempt to increase usage of other elements in our EDI/connectivity product line. In general, EDI services are only sold to those accounts utilizing software from either the QSI Dental or NextGen Divisions. Services include:  Electronic claims submission through our relationships with a number of payors and national claims clearinghouses;  Electronic patient statement processing, appointment reminder cards and calls, recall cards, patient letters, and other correspondence;  Electronic insurance eligibility verification; and  Electronic posting of remittances from insurance carriers into the accounts receivable application. Community Connectivity. The NextGen Division also markets NextGen HIE to facilitate cross-enterprise data sharing, enabling individual medical practices in a given community to selectively share critical data, such as demographics, referrals, medications lists, allergies, diagnoses, lab results, histories and more. This is accomplished through a secure, community-wide data repository that links health care providers, whether they have the NextGenehs system, another compatible electronic medical records system, or no electronic medical records system, together with hospitals, payors, labs and other entities. The product is designed to facilitate a Regional Health Information Organization. The result is that for every health care encounter in the community, a patient-centric and complete record is accessible for the provider. The availability, currency and completeness of information plus the elimination of duplicate data entry can lead to significantly improved patient safety, enhanced decision making capabilities, time efficiencies and cost savings. Our NextGen Division maintains an Internet-based patient health portal, NextMD.com. NextMD.com is a vertical portal for the healthcare industry, linking patients with their physicians, while providing a centralized source of health-oriented information for both consumers and medical professionals. Patients whose physicians are linked to the portal are able to request appointments, send appointment changes or cancellations, receive test results on-line, request prescription refills, view and/or pay their statements, and communicate with their physicians, all in a secure, on-line environment. Our NextGen suite of information systems are or can be linked to NextMD.com, integrating a number of these features with physicians existing systems. Sales and Marketing We sell and market our products nationwide primarily through a direct sales force. The efforts of the direct sales force are augmented by a small number of reseller relationships established by us. Software license sales to resellers represented less than 10% of total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Our direct sales force typically makes presentations to potential clients by demonstrating the system and our capabilities on the prospective clients premises. Sales efforts aimed at smaller practices can be performed on the prospective clients premises, or remotely via telephone or Internet-based presentations. Our sales and marketing employees identify prospective clients through a variety of means, including referrals from existing clients, industry consultants, contacts at professional society meetings, trade shows and seminars, trade journal advertising, direct mail advertising, and telemarketing. Our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty-four months from initial contact to contract execution. Software licenses are normally delivered to a customer almost immediately upon receipt of an order. Implementation and training services are normally rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable. As part of the fees paid by our clients, we normally receive up-front licensing fees. Clients have the option to purchase maintenance services which, if purchased, are invoiced on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Several clients have purchased our practice management software and, in turn, are providing either time-share or billing services to single and group practice practitioners. Under the time-share or billing service agreements, the client provides the use of our software for a fee to one or more practitioners. Although we typically do not receive a fee directly from the distributors customers, implementation of such arrangements has, from time to time, resulted in the purchase of additional software capacity by the distributor, as well as new software purchases made by the distributors customers should such customers decide to perform the practice management functions in-house. 10 Table of Contents We continue to concentrate our direct sales and marketing efforts on medical and dental practices, networks of such practices including MSOs and PHOs, professional schools, community health centers and other ambulatory care settings. MSOs, PHOs and similar networks to which we have sold systems provide use of our software to those group and single physician practices associated with the organization or hospital on either a service basis or by directing us to contract with those practices for the sale of stand-alone systems. We have also entered into marketing assistance agreements with certain of our clients pursuant to which the clients allow us to demonstrate to potential clients the use of systems on the existing clients premises. From time to time we assist prospective clients in identifying third party sources for financing the purchase of our systems. The financing is typically obtained by the client directly from institutional lenders and typically takes the form of a loan from the institution secured by the system to be purchased or a leasing arrangement. We do not guarantee the financing nor retain any continuing interest in the transaction. We have numerous clients and do not believe that the loss of any single client would adversely affect us. No client accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. Customer Service and Support We believe our success is attributable in part to our customer service and support departments. We offer support to our clients seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Our client support staff is comprised of specialists who are knowledgeable in the areas of software and hardware as well as in the day-to-day operations of a practice. System support activities range from correcting minor procedural problems in the clients system to performing complex database reconstructions or software updates. We utilize automated online support systems which assist clients in resolving minor problems and facilitate automated electronic retrieval of problems and symptoms following a clients call to the automated support system. Additionally, our online support systems maintain call records, available at both the clients facility and our offices. We offer our clients support services for most system components, including hardware and software, for a fixed monthly, quarterly or annual fee. Customers also receive access to future unspecified versions of the software, on a when-and-if available basis, as part of support services. We also subcontract, in certain instances, with third party vendors to perform specific hardware maintenance tasks. Implementation and Training We offer full service implementation and training services. When a client signs a contract for the purchase of a system that includes implementation and training services, a client manager/implementation specialist trained in medical and/or dental group practice procedures is assigned to assist the client in the installation of the system and the training of appropriate practice staff. Implementation services include loading the software, training customer personnel, data conversion, running test data, and assisting in the development and documentation of procedures. Implementation and training services are provided by our employees as well as certified third parties and certain resellers. Training may include a combination of computer assisted instruction, or CAI, for certain of our products, remote training techniques and training classes conducted at the clients or our office(s). CAI consists of workbooks, computer interaction and self-paced instruction. CAI is also offered to clients, for an additional charge, after the initial training program is completed for the purpose of training new and additional employees. Remote training allows a trainer at our offices to train one or more people at a client site via telephone and computer connection, thus allowing an interactive and client-specific mode of training without the expense and time required for travel. In addition, our on-line help and other documentation features facilitate client training as well as ongoing support. 11 Table of Contents In addition, NextGen E-learning is an on-line learning subscription service which allows end users to train on the software on the internet. E-learning allows end users to self manage their own learning with their personal learning path and pace. The service allows users to track the status of courses taken. At present, our training facilities are located in (i) Horsham, Pennsylvania, (ii) Atlanta, Georgia, (iii) Dallas, Texas, and (iv) Irvine, California. Competition The markets for healthcare information systems and services are intensely competitive. The industry is highly fragmented and includes numerous competitors, none of which we believe dominates these markets. Our principal existing competitors in the healthcare information systems and services market include: eClinicalWorks, GE Healthcare (GE), Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (Allscripts), EPIC and other competitors. Our recent entry into the small hospital market has introduced new competitors, including Computer Programs and Systems, Inc., Healthland and Healthcare Management Systems, Inc. The electronic patient records and connectivity markets, in particular, are subject to rapid changes in technology, and we expect that competition in these market segments will increase as new competitors enter the market. We believe our principal competitive advantages are the features and capabilities of our products and services, our high level of customer support, and our extensive experience in the industry. The revenue cycle management market is also intensely competitive as other healthcare information systems companies, such as GE and Allscripts, are also in the market of selling both practice management and electronic health records software and medical billing and collection services. Product Enhancement and Development The healthcare information management and computer software and hardware industries are characterized by rapid technological change requiring us to engage in continuing investments to update, enhance, and improve our systems. During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, we expended approximately $24.5 million, $19.7 million, and $17.4 million, respectively, on research and development activities, including capitalized software amounts of $7.9 million, $5.9 million, and $6.0 million, respectively. In addition, a portion of our product enhancements have resulted from software development work performed under contracts with our clients. OTHER INFORMATION Employees As of March 31, 2010, we employed approximately 1,502 persons, of which 1,466 were full-time employees. We believe that our future success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining qualified sales, marketing and technical personnel as well as other employees. Intellectual Property To protect our intellectual property, we enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees with whom such controls are relevant. Certain qualified employees enter into additional agreements that permit them access under certain circumstances, to software matters that are both confidential and more strictly controlled. In addition, we include intellectual property protective provisions in many of our customer contracts. Available Information Our Internet Web site address is www.qsii.com.

RISK FACTORS The more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are described below. However, additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations will likely suffer. Any of these or other factors could harm our business and future results of operations and may cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business The effects of the recent global economic crisis may impact our business, operating results or financial condition. The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. These macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways. For example, current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or to not pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. Our clients may cease business operations or conduct business on a greatly reduced basis. Finally, our investment portfolio, which includes auction rate securities, is generally subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis. If the banking system or the fixed income, credit or equity markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected as well. We face significant, evolving competition which, if we fail to properly address, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and price of our stock. The markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive, and we face significant competition from a number of different sources. Several of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition as well as substantially greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources than we do. There has been significant merger and acquisition activity among a number of our competitors in recent years. Transaction induced pressures, or other related factors may result in price erosion or other negative market dynamics that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and price of our stock. We compete in all of our markets with other major healthcare related companies, information management companies, systems integrators, and other software developers. Competitive pressures and other factors, such as new product introductions by us or our competitors, may result in price or market share erosion that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, there can be no assurance that our applications will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other available software products. Our inability to make initial sales of our systems to newly formed groups and/or healthcare providers that are replacing or substantially modifying their healthcare information systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If new systems sales do not materialize, our near term and longer term revenue will be adversely affected. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we do. In order to compete successfully, we must keep pace with our competitors in anticipating and responding to the rapid changes involving the industry in which we operate, or our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The software market generally is characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards. New product development depends upon significant research and development expenditures which depend ultimately upon sales growth. Any material shortfall in revenue or research 13 Table of Contents funding could impair our ability to respond to technological advances or opportunities in the marketplace and to remain competitive. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In response to increasing market demand, we are currently developing new generations of certain of our software products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop these new software products or that these products will operate successfully, or that any such development, even if successful, will be completed concurrently with or prior to introduction of competing products. Any such failure or delay could adversely affect our competitive position or could make our current products obsolete. We face risk and/or the possibility of claims from activities related to strategic partners, which could be expensive and time-consuming, divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. We rely on third parties to provide services that affect our business. For example, we use national clearinghouses in the processing of some insurance claims and we outsource some of our hardware maintenance services and the printing and delivery of patient statements for our customers. These third parties could raise their prices and/or be acquired by competitors of ours, which could potentially create short and long-term disruptions to our business negatively impacting our revenue, profit and/or stock price. We also have relationships with certain third parties where these third parties serve as sales channels through which we generate a portion of our revenue. Due to these third-party relationships, we could be subject to claims as a result of the activities, products, or services of these third-party service providers even though we were not directly involved in the circumstances leading to those claims. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, defending and investigating these claims could be expensive and time-consuming, divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. We may engage in future acquisitions, which may be expensive and time consuming and from which we may not realize anticipated benefits. We may acquire additional businesses, technologies and products if we determine that these additional businesses, technologies and products are likely to serve our strategic goals. During fiscal year 2009, we acquired HSI and PMP, both of which are full-service healthcare RCM companies servicing physician groups and other healthcare clients. During fiscal year 2010, we acquired Opus and Sphere, both of which are developers of software and services for the inpatient market. The specific risks we may encounter in these types of transactions include but are not limited to the following:  potentially dilutive issuances of our securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition;  use of cash as acquisition currency may adversely affect interest or investment income, thereby potentially adversely affecting our earnings and /or earnings per share;  difficulty in effectively integrating any acquired technologies or software products into our current products and technologies;  difficulty in predicting and responding to issues related to product transition such as development, distribution and customer support;  the possible adverse effect of such acquisitions on existing relationships with third party partners and suppliers of technologies and services;  the possibility that staff or customers of the acquired company might not accept new ownership and may transition to different technologies or attempt to renegotiate contract terms or relationships, including maintenance or support agreements;  the possibility that the due diligence process in any such acquisition may not completely identify material issues associated with product quality, product architecture, product development, intellectual property issues, key personnel issues or legal and financial contingencies, including any deficiencies in internal controls and procedures and the costs associated with remedying such deficiencies; 14 Table of Contents  difficulty in integrating acquired operations due to geographical distance, and language and cultural differences; and  the possibility that acquired assets become impaired, requiring us to take a charge to earnings which could be significant. A failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or technology for any of these reasons could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to manage growth could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have in the past experienced periods of growth which have placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our non-cash resources. We also anticipate expanding our overall software development, marketing, sales, client management and training capacity. In the event we are unable to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals in such capacities within a reasonable timeframe, such failure could have an adverse effect on us. In addition, our ability to manage future increases, if any, in the scope of our operations or personnel will depend on significant expansion of our research and development, marketing and sales, management, and administrative and financial capabilities. The failure of our management to effectively manage expansion in our business could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are dependent upon our key personnel. If such personnel were to leave unexpectedly, we may not be able to execute our business plan. Our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel, many of whom have been with us for a significant period of time. These personnel have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our business. We maintain key man life insurance on only one of our employees. Because we have a relatively small number of employees when compared to other leading companies in our industry, our dependence on maintaining our relationships with key employees is particularly significant. We are also dependent on our ability to attract high quality personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and applications development. The industry in which we operate is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel. There can be no assurance that our current employees will continue to work for us. Loss of services of key employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may need to grant additional equity incentives to key employees and provide other forms of incentive compensation to attract and retain such key personnel. Equity incentives may be dilutive to our per share financial performance. Failure to provide such types of incentive compensation could jeopardize our recruitment and retention capabilities. Continuing worldwide political and economic uncertainties may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. The last several years have been periodically marked by concerns including but not limited to inflation, decreased consumer confidence, the lingering effects of international conflicts, energy costs and terrorist and military activities. These conditions can make it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and they could cause constrained spending on our products and services, and/or delay and lengthen sales cycles. The failure of auction rate securities to sell at their reset dates could impact the liquidity of the investment and could negatively impact the carrying value of the investment. Our investments include auction rate securities (ARS). ARS are securities that are structured with short-term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days but with longer contractual maturities that range, for our holdings, from nine to 28 years. At the end of each reset period, investors can typically sell at auction or continue to hold the securities at par. These securities are subject to fluctuations in interest rate depending on the supply and demand at each auction. As of March 31, 2010, we were holding a total of approximately $7.2 million, net of unrealized loss, in ARS. The Companys ARS are held by UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS). On November 13, 2008, the Company entered into an Auction Rate Security Rights Agreement (the Rights Agreement) with UBS, whereby the Company accepted UBSs offer to purchase the Companys ARS investments at any time during the period of June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. As a result, the Company had obtained an asset, ARS put option rights, whereby the Company has a right to put the ARS back to UBS. The Company expects to exercise its ARS put option rights and put its ARS back to UBS on June 30, 2010, the earliest date allowable under the Rights Agreement. While we believe that UBS has the ability to honor the terms of its 15 Table of Contents agreement to purchase the ARS investments from the Company at par, the failure of UBS to purchase these investments would result in the Company being unable to liquidate these securities in the near future. While these debt securities are all highly-rated investments, generally with AAA/Aaa ratings, continued failure to sell at their reset dates could impact the liquidity of the investment which in turn could negatively impact our liquidity position. Risks Related to Our Products and Service If our principal products and our new product development fail to meet the needs of our clients, we may fail to realize future growth. We currently derive substantially all of our net revenue from sales of our healthcare information systems and related services. We believe that a primary factor in the market acceptance of our systems has been our ability to meet the needs of users of healthcare information systems. Our future financial performance will depend in large part on our ability to continue to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients through the timely development and successful introduction and implementation of new and enhanced versions of our systems and other complementary products. We have historically expended a significant percentage of our net revenue on product development and believe that significant continuing product development efforts will be required to sustain our growth. Continued investment in our sales staff and our client implementation and support staffs will also be required to support future growth. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product development efforts, that the market will continue to accept our existing products, or that new products or product enhancements will be developed and implemented in a timely manner, meet the requirements of healthcare providers, or achieve market acceptance. If new products or product enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. At certain times in the past, we have also experienced delays in purchases of our products by clients anticipating our launch, or the launch of our competitors, of new products. There can be no assurance that material order deferrals in anticipation of new product introductions from ourselves or other entities will not occur. If the emerging technologies and platforms of Microsoft and others upon which we build our products do not gain or continue to maintain broad market acceptance, or if we fail to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products and services compatible with such emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer. Our software products are built and depend upon several underlying and evolving relational database management system platforms such as those developed by Microsoft. To date, the standards and technologies upon which we have chosen to develop our products have proven to have gained industry acceptance. However, the market for our software products is subject to ongoing rapid technological developments, quickly evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements, and there may be existing or future technologies and platforms that achieve industry standard status, which are not compatible with our products. We face the possibility of subscription pricing, which may force us to adjust our sales, marketing and pricing strategies. In April, 2009 we announced a new subscription based, Software as a service delivery model which includes monthly subscription pricing. This model is designed for smaller practices to quickly access the NextGenehr or NextGenepm products at a modest monthly per provider price. We currently derive substantially all of our systems revenue from traditional software license, implementation and training fees, as well as the resale of computer hardware. Today, the majority of our customers pay an initial license fee for the use of our products, in addition to a periodic maintenance fee. While the intent of the new subscription based delivery model is to further penetrate the smaller practice market, there can be no assurance that this delivery model will not become increasingly popular with both small and large customers. If the marketplace increasingly demands subscription pricing, we may be forced to further adjust our sales, marketing and pricing strategies accordingly, by offering a higher percentage of our products and services through these means. Shifting to a significantly greater degree of subscription pricing could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and quarterly and annual revenue and results of operations, as our revenue would initially decrease substantially. There can be no assurance that the marketplace will not increasingly embrace subscription pricing. We face the possibility of claims based upon our Web site content, which may cause us expense and management distraction. We could be subject to third party claims based on the nature and content of information supplied on our Web site by us or third parties, including content providers or users. We could also be subject to 16 Table of Contents liability for content that may be accessible through our Web site or third party Web sites linked from our Web site or through content and information that may be posted by users in chat rooms, bulletin boards or on Web sites created by professionals using our applications. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert managements attention away from our operations. If our security measures are breached or fail, and unauthorized access is obtained to a clients data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities. Our services involve the storage and transmission of clients proprietary information and protected health information of patients. Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client or patient data. As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and significant costs for remediation and remediation efforts to prevent future occurrences. We rely upon our clients as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data. On occasion, our clients have failed to perform these activities. Failure of clients to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients. In addition, our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their client data or the data of their patients on our systems. Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems. Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business. We require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so. If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws. This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data. In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us. Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results. We face the possibility of damages resulting from internal and external security breaches, and viruses. In the course of our business operations, we compile and transmit confidential information, including patient health information, in our processing centers and other facilities. A breach of security in any of these facilities could damage our reputation and result in damages being assessed against us. In addition, the other systems with which we may interface, such as the Internet and related systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors, or similar disruptive problems. The effect of these security breaches and related issues could disrupt our ability to perform certain key business functions and could potentially reduce demand for our services. Accordingly, we have expended significant resources toward establishing and enhancing the security of our related infrastructures, although no assurance can be given that they will be entirely free from potential breach. Maintaining and enhancing our infrastructure security may require us to expend significant capital in the future. The success of our strategy to offer our EDI services and Internet solutions depends on the confidence of our customers in our ability to securely transmit confidential information. Our EDI services and Internet solutions rely on encryption, authentication and other security technology licensed from third parties to achieve secure transmission of confidential information. We may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to or disrupt the transmission of communications by our customers. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate confidential user information or interrupt our, or our customers, operations. In addition, our EDI and Internet solutions may be vulnerable to viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions. 17 Table of Contents Any failure to provide secure infrastructure and/or electronic communication services could result in a lack of trust by our customers causing them to seek out other vendors, and/or, damage our reputation in the market, making it difficult to obtain new customers. We are subject to the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure, which is not within our control, and which may diminish Internet usage and availability as well as access to our Web site. We deliver Internet-based services and, accordingly, we are dependent on the maintenance of the Internet by third parties. The Internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it and our performance may decrease if the Internet continues to experience its historic trend of expanding usage. As a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure, the Internet has experienced a variety of performance problems which may continue into the foreseeable future. Such Internet related problems may diminish Internet usage and availability of the Internet to us for transmittal of our Internet-based services. In addition, difficulties, outages, and delays by Internet service providers, online service providers and other Web site operators may obstruct or diminish access to our Web site by our customers resulting in a loss of potential or existing users of our services. Our products may be subject to product liability legal claims, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain of our products provide applications that relate to patient clinical information. Any failure by our products to provide accurate and timely information concerning patients, their medication, treatment, and health status, generally, could result in claims against us which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance, industry reputation and ability to market new system sales. In addition, a court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly, including through licensed practitioners, or delivery of information by a third party site that a consumer accesses through our Web sites, exposes us to assertions of malpractice, other personal injury liability, or other liability for wrongful delivery/handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information. We maintain insurance to protect against claims associated with the use of our products as well as liability limitation language in our end-user license agreements, but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage or contractual language would adequately cover any claim asserted against us. A successful claim brought against us in excess of or outside of our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even unsuccessful claims could result in our expenditure of funds for litigation and management time and resources. Certain healthcare professionals who use our Internet-based products will directly enter health information about their patients including information that constitutes a record under applicable law that we may store on our computer systems. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, the common law, and contractual obligations, govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information, including:  state and federal privacy and confidentiality laws;  our contracts with customers and partners;  state laws regulating healthcare professionals;  Medicaid laws;  the HIPAA and related rules proposed by the Health Care Financing Administration; and  Health Care Financing Administration standards for Internet transmission of health data. HIPAA establishes elements including, but not limited to, federal privacy and security standards for the use and protection of Protected Health Information. Any failure by us or by our personnel or partners to comply with applicable requirements may result in a material liability to us. Although we have systems and policies in place for safeguarding Protected Health Information from unauthorized disclosure, these systems and policies may not preclude claims against us for alleged violations of applicable requirements. Also, third party sites and/or links that consumers may access through our web sites may not maintain adequate systems to safeguard this information, or may circumvent systems and policies we have put in place. In addition, future laws or changes in current laws may necessitate costly adaptations to our policies, procedures, or systems. 18 Table of Contents There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to product liability claims, that such claims will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Such product liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to the effect of payor and provider conduct which we cannot control and accordingly, there is no assurance that revenue for our services will continue at historic levels. We offer certain electronic claims submission products and services as part of our product line. While we have implemented certain product features designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims submissions, these features may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payors. Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payors, we may be subject to liability claims. Electronic data transmission services are offered by certain payors to healthcare providers that establish a direct link between the provider and payor. This process reduces revenue to third party EDI service providers such as us. As a result of this, or other market factors, we are unable to ensure that we will continue to generate revenue at or in excess of prior levels for such services. A significant increase in the utilization of direct links between healthcare providers and payors could adversely affect our transaction volume and financial results. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing links to payors or develop new connections on terms that are economically satisfactory to us, if at all. Risks Related to Regulation We face increasing involvement of the federal government in our industry, which may give rise to uncertain and unwarranted expectations concerning the benefits we are to receive from government funding and programs. In February 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which allocates over $20 billion dollars to healthcare IT over the next several years. The provision of the legislation that addresses health information technology specifically is known as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act). Under the provisions of HITECH Act, the ARRA includes significant financial incentives to healthcare providers who can demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology beginning in 2011. While the Company expects the ARRA to create significant opportunities for sales of NextGenehr over the next several years, we are unsure of the immediate impact from the ARRA and the long-term potential could be significant. We face the risks and uncertainties that are associated with litigation against us, which may adversely impact our marketing, distract management and have a negative impact upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face the risks associated with litigation concerning the operation of our business. The uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved litigation may have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, such litigation could impair our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers. Defending such litigation may result in a diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such litigation may also have the effect of discouraging potential acquirers from bidding for us or reducing the consideration such acquirers would otherwise be willing to pay in connection with an acquisition. There can be no assurance that such litigation will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Because we believe that proprietary rights are material to our success, misappropriation of these rights could adversely affect our financial condition. We are heavily dependent on the maintenance and protection of our intellectual property and we rely largely on license agreements, confidentiality procedures, and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our software is not patented and existing copyright laws offer only limited practical protection. There can be no assurance that the legal protections and precautions we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies equivalent or 19 Table of Contents superior to ours. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States and are often not enforced as vigorously as those in the United States. We do not believe that our operations or products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. However, there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement or trade secret claims against us with respect to our current or future products or that any such assertion will not require us to enter into a license agreement or royalty arrangement or other financial arrangement with the party asserting the claim. Responding to and defending any such claims may distract the attention of our management and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, claims may be brought against third parties from which we purchase software, and such claims could adversely affect our ability to access third party software for our systems. If we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services. We are and may continue to be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our applications functionality is viewed as similar or overlapping with competitive products. We do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties. However, claims are occasionally asserted against us, and we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future. Also, we cannot assure you that any such claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims  even if we are ultimately successful in the defense of such matters. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. In addition, we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We are dependent on our license rights and other services from third parties, which may cause us to discontinue, delay or reduce product shipments. We depend upon licenses for some of the technology used in our products as well as other services from third-party vendors. Most of these arrangements can be continued/renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated for any number of reasons. We may not be able to continue using the products or services made available to us under these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce product shipments or services provided until we can obtain equivalent technology or services. Most of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive. Our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the business elements covered by these arrangements and use these elements to compete directly with us. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue providing their technology or services in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products. There is significant uncertainty in the healthcare industry in which we operate, and we are subject to the possibility of changing government regulation, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement processes and operation of healthcare facilities. During the past several years, the healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation of, among other things, reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures. In the past, various legislators have announced that they intend to examine proposals to reform certain aspects of the U.S. healthcare system including proposals which may change governmental involvement in healthcare and reimbursement rates, and otherwise alter the operating environment for us and our clients. Healthcare providers may react to these proposals, and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals, by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our systems and related services. Cost-containment measures instituted by healthcare providers as a result of regulatory reform or otherwise could result in a reduction in the allocation of capital funds. Such a reduction could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our systems and related services. On the other hand, changes in the regulatory environment have increased and may continue to increase the needs of healthcare organizations for cost-effective data management and thereby enhance the overall market for healthcare management information systems. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As existing regulations mature and become better defined, we anticipate that these regulations will continue to directly affect certain of our products and services, but we cannot fully predict the effect at this time. We have taken 20 Table of Contents steps to modify our products, services and internal practices as necessary to facilitate our compliance with the regulations, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in a timely or complete manner. Achieving compliance with these regulations could be costly and distract managements attention and divert other company resources, and any noncompliance by us could result in civil and criminal penalties. Developments of additional federal and state regulations and policies have the potential to positively or negatively affect our business. Our software may potentially be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device. Such regulation could require the registration of the applicable manufacturing facility and software and hardware products, application of detailed record-keeping and manufacturing standards, and FDA approval or clearance prior to marketing. An approval or clearance requirement could create delays in marketing, and the FDA could require supplemental filings or object to certain of these applications, the result of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The United States Congress in 2009 enacted legislation that would cut Medicare reimbursement to physicians by 21% per procedure. Congress has passed several successive acts postponing the cuts and there is discussion to rescind the cut. However, should the cuts be implemented by Medicare, there would be a direct material adverse revenue and earnings impact to our RCM revenue stream. The impact would vary by client depending on the clients concentration of Medicare patients. Disruption could also affect system sales due to client reexamination of IT spending. We may be subject to false or fraudulent claim laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement. In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment. Any failure of our RCM services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability including, but not limited to, criminal liability, could adversely affect demand for our services and could force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to address the failure. Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payors and have an adverse effect on our business. In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our RCM services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services. To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices. A portion of our business involves billing of Medicare claims on behalf of its clients. In an effort to combat fraudulent Medicare claims, the federal government offers rewards for reporting of Medicare fraud which could encourage others to subject us to a charge of fraudulent claims, including charges that are ultimately proven to be without merit. If our products fail to comply with evolving government and industry standards and regulations, we may have difficulty selling our products. We may be subject to additional federal and state statutes and regulations in connection with offering services and products via the Internet. On an increasingly frequent basis, federal and state legislators are proposing laws and regulations that apply to Internet commerce and communications. Areas being affected by these regulations include user privacy, pricing, content, taxation, copyright protection, distribution, and quality of products and services. To the extent that our products and services are subject to these laws and regulations, the sale of our products and services could be harmed. We are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance, one or more of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations. Based on our reading and interpretations of relevant guidance, principles or 21 Table of Contents concepts issued by, among other authorities, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the Commission, we believe our current sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported. However, there continue to be issued interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry. Future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in changes in our revenue recognition and/or other accounting policies and practices that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations. Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have an adverse effect on our business, and our per share price may be adversely affected. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404) and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC to implement Section 404, we are required to include in our Form 10-K a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The assessment must include disclosure of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. As part of the ongoing evaluation being undertaken by management and our independent registered public accountants pursuant to Section 404, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2010. However, if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting, we may discover material weaknesses that we would then be required to disclose. Any material weaknesses identified in our internal controls could have an adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to accurately or timely report on our financial results, and we might be subject to investigation by regulatory authorities. This could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have an adverse effect on our stock price. No evaluation process can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect and correct all failures within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. In addition, if we continue to expand, through either organic growth or through acquisitions (or both), the challenges involved in implementing appropriate controls will increase and may require that we evolve some or all of our internal control processes. It is also possible that the overall scope of Section 404 may be revised in the future, thereby causing our auditors and ourselves to review, revise or reevaluate our internal control processes which may result in the expenditure of additional human and financial resources. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock The unpredictability of our quarterly operating results may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline. Our revenue may fluctuate in the future from quarter to quarter and period to period, as a result of a number of factors including, without limitation:  the size and timing of orders from clients;  the specific mix of software, hardware, and services in client orders;  the length of sales cycles and installation processes;  the ability of our clients to obtain financing for the purchase of our products;  changes in pricing policies or price reductions by us or our competitors;  the timing of new product announcements and product introductions by us or our competitors;  changes in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and/or established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other rule-making bodies;  accounting policies concerning the timing of the recognition of revenue;  the availability and cost of system components; 22 Table of Contents  the financial stability of clients;  market acceptance of new products, applications and product enhancements;  our ability to develop, introduce and market new products, applications and product enhancements;  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs;  deferrals of client orders in anticipation of new products, applications, product enhancements, or public/private sector initiatives;  execution of or changes to our strategy;  personnel changes; and  general market/economic factors. Our software products are generally shipped as orders are received and accordingly, we have historically operated with a minimal backlog of license fees. As a result, revenue in any quarter is dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and is not predictable with any degree of certainty. Furthermore, our systems can be relatively large and expensive, and individual systems sales can represent a significant portion of our revenue and profits for a quarter such that the loss or deferral of even one such sale can adversely affect our quarterly revenue and profitability. Clients often defer systems purchases until our quarter end, so quarterly results generally cannot be predicted and frequently are not known until after the quarter has concluded. Our sales are dependent upon clients initial decisions to replace or substantially modify their existing information systems, and subsequently, their decision concerning which products and services to purchase. These are major decisions for healthcare providers and, accordingly, the sales cycle for our systems can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty four months from initial contact to contract execution/shipment. Because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed, a variation in the timing of systems sales, implementations, and installations can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result, we believe that interim period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. Further, our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for any particular period. We currently recognize revenue pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 985-605, Software, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 985-605. ASC 985-605 summarizes the FASBs views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. There can be no assurance that application and subsequent interpretations of these pronouncements will not further modify our revenue recognition policies, or that such modifications would not adversely affect our operating results reported in any particular quarter or year. Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such event, the price of our common stock would likely be adversely affected. Our common stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares of our common stock and in litigation against us. Volatility may be caused by a number of factors including but not limited to:  actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results;  rumors about our performance, software solutions, or merger and acquisition activity;  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;  governmental regulatory action;  health care reform measures; 23 Table of Contents  client relationship developments;  purchases or sales of company stock;  activities by one or more of our major shareholders concerning our policies and operations;  changes occurring in the markets in general;  macroeconomic conditions, both nationally and internationally; and  other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software, healthcare and high technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. Moreover, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources. Two of our directors are significant shareholders, which makes it possible for them to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval and which influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders. Two of our directors and principal shareholders beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 33.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at March 31, 2010. California law and our Bylaws permit our shareholders to cumulate their votes, the effect of which is to provide shareholders with sufficiently large concentrations of our shares the opportunity to assure themselves one or more seats on our Board of Directors. The amounts required to assure a Board position can vary based upon the number of shares outstanding, the number of shares voting, the number of directors to be elected, the number of broker non-votes, and the number of shares held by the shareholder exercising cumulative voting rights. In the event that cumulative voting is invoked, it is likely that the two of our directors holding an aggregate of approximately 33.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at March 31, 2010 will each have sufficient votes to assure themselves of one or more seats on our Board of Directors. With or without cumulative voting, these shareholders will have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions. In fiscal year 2009, one of the principal shareholders, Ahmed Hussein, proposed a different slate of directors than what the Company proposed to shareholders. The Company spent approximately $1.5 million to defend the Companys slate. In addition, such influence by one or both of these shareholders could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting to purchase us, implement a change over our Board of Directors and management, and/or reducing the market price offered for our common stock in such an event. Our future policy concerning the payment of dividends is uncertain, which could adversely affect the price of our stock. We have announced our intention to pay a quarterly dividend commencing with the conclusion of our first fiscal quarter of 2008 (June 30, 2007) and pursuant to this policy our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend ranging from $0.25 to its most recent level of $0.30 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock, each quarter thereafter. We anticipate that future quarterly dividends, if and when declared by our Board of Directors pursuant to this policy, would likely be distributable on or about the fifth day of each of the months of October, January, April and July. There can be no guarantees that we will have the financial wherewithal to fund this dividend in perpetuity or to pay it at historic rates. Further, our Board of Directors may decide not to pay the dividend at some future time for financial or non-financial reasons. Unfulfilled expectations regarding future dividends could adversely affect the price of our stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 24 Table of Contents
