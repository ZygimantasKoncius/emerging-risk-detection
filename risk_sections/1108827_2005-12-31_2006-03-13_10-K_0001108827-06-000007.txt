FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT, 2005 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Nature of Business Market Resources is a natural gas-focused energy company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Questar and Questars primary growth driver. Market Resources is a sub-holding company with four principal subsidiaries: Questar Exploration and Production Company (Questar E&P) acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas, oil, and NGL; Wexpro Company (Wexpro) manages, develops and produces cost-of-service reserves for affiliated company, Questar Gas; Questar Gas Management Company (Gas Management) provides midstream field services including natural gas-gathering and processing services for affiliates and third parties; and Questar Energy Trading Company (Energy Trading) markets equity and third-party gas and oil, provides risk-management services, and through its wholly owned limited liability company, Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC, owns and operates an underground natura l gas-storage reservoir. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for financial information concerning Market Resources lines of business that contribute 10% or more of consolidated revenues. The corporate-organization structure and major subsidiaries are summarized below: # Questar E&P Questar E&P operates in two core areas  the Rocky Mountain region of Wyoming, Utah and Colorado and the Midcontinent region of Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. Questar E&P has a large inventory of identified development drilling locations, primarily on the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming and in the Uinta Basin of Utah. Questar E&P continues to conduct exploratory drilling to determine commerciality of its inventory of undeveloped leaseholds located primarily in the Rocky Mountain region, including the assessment of deeper reservoirs under approximately 143,000 net leasehold acres in the Vermillion Basin of southwest Wyoming and northwestern Colorado. In the Midcontinent, Questar E&P has several active development projects, including an ongoing coalbed methane project in the Arkoma Basin of eastern Oklahoma and an infill development drilling project in the El m Grove area in northwestern Louisiana. Questar E&P seeks to maintain geographical and geological diversity with its two core areas. Questar E&P has in the past and may in the future pursue acquisition of producing properties through the purchase of assets or corporate entities to expand its presence in its core areas or create a new core area. Questar E&P reported 1,480 Bcfe of estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2005. Approximately 80% of Questar E&Ps proved reserves, or 1,179 Bcfe, were located in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, while the remaining 20%, or 301 Bcfe, was located in the Midcontinent region. Approximately 920 Bcfe of the proved reserves reported by Questar E&P at year-end 2005 were developed, while 560 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. The majority of the proved undeveloped reserves were associated with the Companys Pinedale Anticline leasehold. Questar E&Ps primary focus is natural gas. Natural gas comprised about 90% of Questar E&Ps total proved reserves at year-end 2005. See Item 2 in Part I and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for more information on Questar E&Ps proved reserves. Questar E&P  Competition and Customers. Questar E&P faces competition in every part of its business, including the acquisition of reserves and leases. Its longer-term growth strategy depends, in part, on its ability to purchase reasonably priced reserves and develop them in a low-cost and efficient manner. Competition is particularly intense when prices are high, as has been the case in recent years. Questar E&P, through Energy Trading, sells natural gas production to a variety of customers, including pipelines, gas-marketing firms, industrial users and local-distribution companies. It regularly evaluates counterparty credit and may require financial guarantees from parties that fail to meet its credit criteria. Energy Trading sells equity crude-oil production to refiners, remarketers and other companies, including some with pipeline facilities near company producing properties. In the event pipeline facilities are not available, Energy Trading transports crude oil by truck to storage, refining or pipeline facilities. Questar E&P  Regulation. Questar E&Ps operations are subject to various government controls and regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Questar E&P must obtain permits to drill and produce; maintain bonding requirements to drill and operate wells; submit and implement spill-prevention plans; and file notices relating to the presence, use, and release of specified contaminants incidental to gas and oil production. Questar E&P is also subject to various conservation matters, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units, the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of gas and oil properties. Most Questar E&P leases in the Rocky Mountain area are granted by the federal government and administered by federal agencies. Development of Pinedale leasehold acreage is subject to the terms of certain winter-drilling restrictions. During the last two years, Market Resources has been working with federal and state officials in Wyoming to obtain authorization for limited winter-drilling activities and has developed innovative measures, such as drilling multiple wells from a single location, to minimize the impact of its activities on wildlife and wildlife habitat. The presence of wildlife and potential endangered species could limit access to public lands. Various wildlife species inhabit Market Resources leaseholds at Pinedale and in other areas. Current federal regulations restrict activities during certain times of the year on portions of Market Resources leaseholds due to wildlife activity and/or h abitat. Some species that are known to be present may be listed under federal law as endangered or threatened. Such listing could have a material impact on access to Market Resources leaseholds in certain areas or during periods when the particular species is present. Wexpro Wexpro develops and produces gas and oil on certain properties owned by affiliate Questar Gas under the terms of a comprehensive agreement, the Wexpro Agreement. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after-tax return of approximately 19% on its investment in commercial wells and related facilities  adjusted for working capital and reduced for deferred income taxes and depreciation  its investment base. The term of the Wexpro Agreement coincides with the productive life of the gas and oil properties covered therein. Wexpros investment base totaled $206.3 million at December 31, 2005. Wexpro delivers natural gas production to Questar Gas at a price equal to Wexpros cost-of-service. Wexpro cost-of-service gas satisfied 41% of Questar Gas system requirements during 2005 at cost of service pricing that is significantly lower than Questar Gas cost for purchased gas. Wexpro gas and oil-development and production activities are subject to the same type of regulation as Questar E&P. In addition, the Utah Division of Public Utilities has oversight responsibility and retains an outside reservoir-engineering consultant and a financial auditor to assess the prudence of Wexpros activities. Wexpro owns oil-producing properties. Under terms of the Wexpro Agreement, revenues from crude-oil sales offset operating expenses and provide Wexpro with a return on its investment. Any remaining revenues, after recovery of expenses and Wexpros return on investment, are divided between Wexpro (46%) and Questar Gas (54%). Wexpro operations are contractually limited to a finite set of properties set forth in the Wexpro Agreement. Advances in technology (pad drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulation) have unlocked significant unexploited potential on many of the subject properties. Wexpro has identified $600 to $750 million of additional drilling opportunities that could support high single-digit to low double-digit growth in revenues and net income over the next five to ten years while delivering cost-of-service natural gas supplies to Questar Gas at prices competitive with alternative sources. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for more information on the Wexpro Agreement. Gas Management Gas Management provides natural gas-gathering and processing services to affiliates and third-party producers in the Rocky Mountain region. Gas Management also owns 50% of Rendezvous Gas Services, LLC, (Rendezvous), a joint venture that operates gas-gathering facilities in western Wyoming. Rendezvous gathers natural gas for Pinedale Anticline and Jonah field producers for delivery to various interstate pipelines. Under a contract with Questar Gas, Gas Management also gathers cost-of-service volumes produced from properties operated by Wexpro. Approximately 56% of Gas Managements revenues are derived from fee-based gathering and processing agreements. The remaining revenues are derived from natural gas processing margins that are in part exposed to the frac spread. To reduce processing margin risk, Gas Management has restructured many of its processing agreements with producers from keep-whole contracts to fee-based contracts. A keep-whole contract insulates producers from frac spread risk while a fee-based contract eliminates commodity price risk for the processing plant owner. To further reduce processing margin volatility associated with keep-whole contracts, Gas Management may also attempt to reduce processing margin risk with forward-sales contracts for NGL or hedge NGL prices and equivalent gas volumes with the intent to lock in a processing margin. Energy Trading Energy Trading markets natural gas, oil and NGL. It combines gas volumes purchased from third parties and equity production to build a flexible and reliable portfolio. As a wholesale marketing entity, Energy Trading concentrates on markets in the Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest and Midcontinent that are close to reserves owned by affiliates or accessible by major pipelines. It contracts for firm-transportation capacity on pipelines and firm-storage capacity at Clay Basin, a large baseload-storage facility owned by affiliate Questar Pipeline. Energy Trading, through its Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC, operates an underground gas-storage reservoir in southwestern Wyoming. It uses owned and leased-storage capacity together with firm-transportation capacity to take advantage of price differentials and arbitrage opportunities. Energy Trading uses derivatives to manage commodity price risk. Energy Trading primarily uses fixed-price swaps to secure a known price for a specific volume of company production. Energy Trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions. See Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 and Commodity-Price Risk Management included in Item 7A in Part II of this Annual Report for additional information relating to hedging activities. Environmental Matters See Item 3. Legal Proceedings in Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the Companys environmental matters. Employees At December 31, 2005, Market Resources had 601 employees compared with 563 at year-end 2004. None of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. The Company also periodically engages independent reservoir-engineering consultants and other technical specialists on a fee basis. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Investors should read carefully the following factors as well as the cautionary statements referred to in Forward-Looking Statements herein. If any of the risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report actually occur, the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The future price of natural gas, oil and NGL is unpredictable. Historically the price of natural gas, oil and NGL has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Any significant or extended decline in commodity prices would impact the Companys future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and rate of growth. Because approximately 90% of the Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2005, was natural gas, the Company is substantially more sensitive to changes in natural gas prices than to changes in oil prices. Market Resources cannot predict the future price of natural gas, oil and NGL because of factors beyond its control, including but not limited to: * changes in domestic and foreign supply of natural gas, oil and NGL; * changes in local, regional, national and global demand for natural gas, oil, and NGL; * regional price differences resulting from available pipeline transportation capacity or local demand; * the level of imports of, and the price of, foreign natural gas, oil and NGL; * domestic and global economic conditions; * domestic political developments; * weather conditions; * domestic and foreign government regulations and taxes; * political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; * the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels; * U.S. storage levels of natural gas, oil, and NGL. Market Resources uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to uncertain prices. Market Resources uses financial contracts to hedge exposure to volatile natural gas, oil, and NGL prices and to protect cash flow, returns on capital, net income and credit ratings from downward commodity price movements. To the extent the Company hedges commodity price exposure, it forgoes the benefits otherwise experienced if commodity prices increase. Market Resources believes its Wexpro subsidiary generates revenues that are not significantly sensitive to short-term fluctuations in commodity prices. The Company enters into commodity price hedging arrangements with creditworthy counterparties (banks and industry participants) with a variety of credit requirements. Some contracts do not require the Company to post cash collateral, while others allow some amount of credit before requiring deposits of collateral for out-of-the-money hedges. The amount of credit available may vary depending on the credit rating assigned to the Companys debt securities. A substantial increase in the price of natural gas, oil and/or NGL could result in the requirement to deposit large amounts of collateral with counterparties that could seriously impact the Companys cash liquidity. Additionally a downgrade in the Companys credit ratings to sub-investment grade could result in the acceleration of obligations to hedge counterparties. The Company may not be able to economically find and develop new reserves. The Companys profitability depends not only on prevailing prices for natural gas, oil and NGL, but also its ability to find, develop and acquire gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire gas and oil reserves to replace those depleted by production. Gas and oil reserve estimates are imprecise and subject to revision. Questar E&Ps proved natural gas and oil reserve estimates are prepared annually by independent reservoir-engineering consultants. Gas and oil reserve estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of these estimates depends on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserve estimates are imprecise and will change as additional information becomes available. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times may vary significantly. Results of subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either upward or downward revisions of previous estimates. In addition the estimation process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remedial costs. Actual results most likely will vary from the estimates. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves and the present value of those reserves. Investors should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from Questar E&Ps proved reserves referred to in this Annual Report is the current market value of the estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from Questar E&Ps proved reserves is based on prices and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the current estimate, and future determinations of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. Market Resources faces many operating risks to develop and produce its reserves. Drilling is a high-risk activity. Operating risks include: fire, explosions and blow-outs; unexpected drilling conditions such as abnormally pressured formations; abandonment costs; pipe, cement or casing failures; environmental accidents such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, brine or well fluids (including groundwater contamination). The Company could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life; pollution or other environmental damage; damage to or destruction of property and equipment; regulatory investigation; fines or curtailment of operations; or attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, the Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. Market Resources can not assure that insurance will be adequate to cover these losses or liabilities. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and operations. Shortages of oilfield equipment, services and qualified personnel could impact results of operations. The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. There have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased costs for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. These shortages or cost increases could impact profit margin, cash flow and operating results or restrict the ability to drill wells and conduct operations. A significant portion of Market Resources production, revenue and cash flow are derived from assets that are concentrated in a geographical area. While geographic concentration of assets provides scope and scale that can reduce operating costs and provide other operating synergies, asset concentration does increase exposure to certain risks. Market Resources has extensive operations on the Pinedale Anticline and in the Greater Green River Basin of southwestern Wyoming. Any circumstance or event that negatively impacts the operations of Questar E&P, Wexpro or Gas Management in that area could materially reduce earnings and cash flow. Market Resources is subject to complex regulations on many levels. The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and tend to become more onerous over time. In addition to the costs of compliance, substantial costs may be incurred to take corrective actions at both owned and previously owned facilities. Accidental spills and leaks requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. As standards change, the Company may incur significant costs in cases where past operations followed practices that were considered acceptable at the time but that now require remedial work to meet current standards. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in fines, significant costs for remedial activities, or injunctions. The Company must comply with numerous and complex regulations governing activities on federal and state lands in the Rocky Mountain region, notably the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Federal and state agencies frequently impose conditions on the Companys activities. These restrictions tend to become more stringent over time and can limit or prevent exploring for, finding and producing natural gas and oil on the Companys Rockies leasehold. Certain environmental groups oppose drilling on some of Market Resources federal and state leases. Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to gas and oil operations on Native American tribal lands. These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, environmental standards and royalty considerations. In addition each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees, requirements to employ Native American tribal members and other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations on Native American tribal lands. Finally, lessees and operators con ducting operations on tribal lands are generally subject to the Native American tribal court system. One or more of these factors may increase the Companys costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the viability of its gas, oil and transportation operations on such lands. Market Resources is dependent on bank credit facilities and continued access to capital markets to successfully execute its operating strategies. The Company relies on bank borrowing, inter-company loans from Questar and access to public capital markets to finance a material portion of its operating strategies. Questar relies on access to short-term commercial paper markets to make inter-company loans. The Company is dependent on these capital sources to provide capital to acquire and develop properties. The availability and cost of these capital sources is cyclical, and they may not remain available, or the Company may not be able to obtain money at a reasonable cost in the future. All of the Companys bank loans and short-term loans from Questar are in the form of floating-rate debt. From time to time the Company may use interest rate derivatives to fix the rate on a portion of its variable rate debt. The interest rates on bank loans are tied to debt credit ratings of the Company published by Standard & Poor's and Moody's. A downgrade of these credit ratings could increase the interest cost of debt and decrease future availability of money from banks and other sources. Management believes it is important to maintain investment grade credit ratings to conduct the Companys businesses, but may not be able to keep investment grade ratings. There is no promise of continuing relationships with Questar. Market Resources is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Questar and its goals and strategies are important to Questar. Questar, however, offers no explicit promise of continued ownership or of the availability of capital going forward. The Companys ability to receive future equity and debt capital from its parent also depends on Questar's ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms. Market Resources subsidiaries benefit from business transactions with affiliated companies. Gas Management and Wexpro have long-term agreements to gather and develop reserves owned by affiliate Questar Gas. All transactions are on a competitive market basis or under contracts approved by regulatory agencies and the courts, but such business relationships may not continue in the future. General economic and other conditions impact Market Resources results. The Companys results may also be negatively affected by: changes in general economic conditions; changes in regulation; availability and economic viability of gas and oil properties for sale or exploration; creditworthiness of counterparties; rate of inflation and interest rates; assumptions used in business combinations; weather and natural disasters; changes in customers credit ratings; competition from other forms of energy, other pipelines and storage facilities; effects of accounting policies issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies; terrorist attacks or acts of war; changes in business or financial condition; changes in credit ratings; and availability of financing for Market Resources.
