Item 1A. Risk Factors. These factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. FedFirst Financial Corporation assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS General FedFirst Financial Corporation (FedFirst Financial or the Company) is a stock holding company established in 2010, whose wholly owned subsidiary is First Federal Savings Bank (First Federal or the Bank), a federally chartered stock savings bank. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary FedFirst Exchange Corporation (FFEC), the Bank has an 80% controlling interest in Exchange Underwriters, Inc. (Exchange Underwriters). Exchange Underwriters is a full-service, independent insurance agency that offers property and casualty, commercial liability, surety and other insurance products. The Bank operates as a community-oriented financial institution offering residential, multi-family and commercial mortgages, consumer loans and commercial business loans as well as a variety of deposit products for individuals and businesses from seven locations in southwestern Pennsylvania. The Bank conducts insurance brokerage activities through Exchange Underwriters. The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. Our website address is http://www.firstfederal-savings.com. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Market Area Our seven banking offices are located in Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties, which are located in the southern suburban area of metropolitan Pittsburgh. Generally, our offices are located in small industrial communities that, in the past, relied extensively on the steel industry. Until the mid-1970s, these communities flourished. However, the economy of our market area has diminished in direct correlation with the decline in the United States steel industry. With the decline of the steel industry, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties now have smaller and more diversified economies, with employment in services constituting the primary source of employment in all three counties. The largest private-sector employers in our market area are providers of health care services. The area has been impacted by the energy industry through the extraction of untapped natural gas reserves in the Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale extends throughout much of the Appalachian Basin and most of Pennsylvania and is located near high-demand markets along the east coast. The proximity to these markets makes it an attractive target for energy development and has resulted in significant job creation through the development of gas wells and transportation of gas. K-1 Table of Contents In the past, the communities in which our offices are located provided a stable customer base for traditional thrift products, such as savings, certificates of deposit and residential mortgages. Following the closing of the areas steel mills, population and employment trends declined. The population in many of the smaller communities in our market area continues to shrink as the younger population leaves to seek better and more reliable employment. As a result, the median age of our customers has been increasing. With an aging customer base and little new real estate development, the lending opportunities in our primary market area are limited. To counter these trends, we expanded into communities that are experiencing population growth and economic expansion and consolidated two offices. In 2006, we opened an office in Peters Township in Washington County. In 2007, we opened an office in the downtown area of Washington, Pennsylvania. In 2011 and 2012, we consolidated our Park Centre and Donora offices in the Middle Monongahela Valley area due to the close proximity of other branch locations. Competition We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the several financial institutions operating in our market area and from other financial service companies, such as brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. At June 30, 2012, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the FDIC, we held approximately 0.25% of the deposits in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Banks owned by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and BNY Mellon also operate in our market area. These institutions, as well as many other banking institutions operating in our market area, are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have significantly greater resources. Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our market area and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future. Lending Activities Residential Mortgage Loans. Our primary lending activity is the origination of mortgage loans to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes located in the greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area. We offer fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years. The relative amount of fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. Borrower demand for adjustable versus fixed rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed rate mortgage loans and the initial period interest rates and loan fees for adjustable rate loans. The loan fees charged, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. We currently have a low demand for our adjustable rate mortgage loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable rate mortgage loans generally adjust annually after an initial fixed period that ranges from one to ten years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate typically equal to 2.75% or 3.00% above the applicable index. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan. K-2 Table of Contents Prior to 2006, we purchased newly originated, single family, fixed rate mortgage loans to supplement our origination activities. The properties securing the loans are located in 12 states around the country. We underwrote all of the purchased loans to the same standards as loans originated by us. We may purchase additional loans in the future to supplement our origination activities. At December 31, 2012, we had 77 purchased residential loans that totaled $10.2 million. Of these, 32 loans totaling $3.9 million were secured by homes in Michigan and 15 loans totaling $2.4 million were secured by homes in Ohio. While residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30 year terms, such loans may remain outstanding for shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. We generally do not make conventional loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 97%. Loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% typically require private mortgage insurance or additional collateral. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved, independent appraiser and title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance for loans on property located in a flood zone, before closing the loan. In an effort to provide financing for low and moderate income and first-time buyers, we offer a special home buyers program. We offer residential mortgage loans through this program to qualified individuals and originate the loans using modified underwriting guidelines, including reduced fees and loan conditions. We do not engage in subprime or Alt-A lending. Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. We offer a variety of fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate. These loans generally have terms of ten years with a 20 year amortization and are typically secured by apartment buildings, office buildings, or manufacturing facilities. Loans are secured by first mortgages, and amounts generally do not exceed 80% of the propertys appraised value. In addition to originating these loans, we also purchase participation loans originated by and sell participation loans to other financial institutions in the region. In reaching a decision on whether to grant a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, we consider the cash flow of the property, the borrowers expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. We also may look to the financial strength of any related entities in approving the request. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have a debt service coverage ratio (cash flow available to service debt/debt service) of at least 1.25x and a leverage ratio (debt-to-worth) of less than 3.0x. Environmental surveys are obtained for requests greater than $1.0 million or when circumstances suggest the possibility of the presence of hazardous materials. To monitor cash flow on income properties, we require borrowers and/or guarantors to provide annual financial statements regarding the commercial and multi-family real estate. We underwrite all commercial loan participations to the same standards as loans originated by us. In addition, we also consider the financial strength and reputation of the lead lender. We require the lead lender to provide a full closing package as well as annual financial statements for the borrower and related entities so that we can conduct an annual loan review for all loan participations. Prior to 2006, we purchased newly originated multi-family real estate loans as part of our efforts to increase our loan portfolio. The properties securing the loans are located in five states throughout the country. We sought geographic diversification among the purchased loans so that we would not concentrate exposure to changes in any particular local or regional economy. We underwrote all of the purchased loans to the same standards as loans originated by us. At December 31, 2012, purchased multi-family real estate loans totaled $4.2 million. At December 31, 2012, our largest multi-family real estate loan was $3.5 million and was secured by a 10 building apartment complex. Our largest commercial real estate loan was a $2.4 million line of credit secured by a commercial property with $2.3 million outstanding. These loans were performing in accordance with their original terms at December 31, 2012. K-3 Table of Contents At December 31, 2012, commercial real estate and multi-family purchased loan participations totaled $9.2 million and sold loan participations totaled $3.2 million. All of the properties securing these loans are located in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Our largest purchased participation loan was $1.2 million and largest sold participation loan was $2.0 million. Construction Loans. We originate loans to individuals to finance the construction of residential dwellings. We also make loans for the construction of commercial properties, including apartment buildings and owner-occupied properties used for businesses. Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually 12 to 18 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent mortgage loan. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 97% on residential construction and 80% on commercial construction. Loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% on residential construction generally require private mortgage insurance or additional collateral. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also will require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. At December 31, 2012, our largest outstanding residential construction loan commitment was for $1.0 million, of which $233,000 was disbursed. At December 31, 2012, our largest outstanding commercial construction commitment was a $1.5 million purchased participation loan of which $1.4 million was disbursed. These loans were performing in accordance with their original terms at December 31, 2012. Commercial Business Loans. We originate commercial business loans to professionals and small businesses in our market area. We offer installment loans for a variety of business needs including capital improvements and equipment acquisition. Other commercial loans are secured by business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment, and are typically backed by the personal guarantee of the borrower. We originate working capital lines of credit to finance the short-term needs of businesses. These credit lines are repaid by seasonal cash flows from operations and are also typically backed by the personal guarantee of the borrower. When evaluating commercial business loans, we perform a detailed financial analysis of the borrower and/or guarantor which includes but is not limited to: cash flow and balance sheet analysis, debt service capabilities, review of industry (geographic and economic conditions) and collateral analysis. We also provide financing to a Pittsburgh area machinery and equipment leasing company. These loans are secured with an assignment of machinery and equipment leases. At December 31, 2012, we had seven loans for equipment leases totaling $3.5 million. At December 31, 2012, our largest commercial business loan relationship was a $3.0 million warehouse line of credit, of which $1.0 million was outstanding. This loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2012. Consumer Loans. Our consumer loans include home equity lines of credit, home equity installment loans, loans on savings accounts, and personal lines of credit and installment loans. The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicants payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicants creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. Home equity installment loans and home equity lines of credit are generally originated with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less. On occasion we originate home equity loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80% and, in 2007, we discontinued offering home equity loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 100%. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest that are indexed to the prime rate. Home equity installment loans have fixed interest rates and terms that range up to 30 years. We also offer secured and unsecured consumer loans that have fixed interest rates and terms that can range from one to 10 years. Loan Underwriting Risks Adjustable Rate Loans. While we anticipate that adjustable rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed rate mortgages, the increased mortgage payments required of adjustable rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. In addition, although adjustable rate mortgage loans help make our asset base more responsive to K-4 Table of Contents changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending is the borrowers creditworthiness and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Construction Loans. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the propertys value at completion of construction and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the building. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a building having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. If we are forced to foreclose on a building before or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. Commercial Business Loans. Commercial business loans are higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. A debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25x and a leverage ratio of less than 3.0x are also applicable to commercial business loans. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. We also maintain allowable advance rates for each collateral type to ensure coverage. Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrowers continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary source of loan originations are telephone marketing efforts, existing customers, walk-in traffic, loan brokers, advertising and referrals from customers. We have a relationship with a mortgage broker through which we originate a substantial portion of our residential mortgage loans, and we have a relationship with a commercial leasing company through which we originate commercial equipment leases. We originate loans for our portfolio and have not sold any loans. Prior to 2006, we purchased loans to supplement our own loan originations. Loan Approval Procedures and Authority Our lending activities follow written, nondiscriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and management. The board of directors has granted certain loan approval authority to a committee of officers. The loan committee approves all residential mortgages, construction loans and consumer loans. All commercial and multi-family loans with commercial direct hard exposure (CDHE) of $500,000 or more and loans or extensions of credit to insiders require the approval of the board of directors. All commercial loans with CDHE up to $500,000 require approval from a committee that includes two executive officers. K-5 Table of Contents Loans to One Borrower The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrowers related entities is limited, by regulation, to generally 15.0% of our unimpaired capital and surplus. At December 31, 2012, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was $6.7 million. At that date, our largest lending relationship was a $3.9 million commercial real estate relationship. The loans were performing in accordance with their original terms at December 31, 2012. Loan Commitments We issue commitments for fixed and adjustable rate mortgage and commercial loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, our residential loan commitments expire after 45 days and our commercial loan commitments expire after 90 days. Investment Activities We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, Government-sponsored enterprise securities and securities of various federal agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain regulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in corporate securities and mutual funds. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Pittsburgh stock. While we have the authority under applicable law and our investment policies to invest in derivative securities, we have never invested in such investments. At December 31, 2012, our investment portfolio consisted of municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, guaranteed REMIC pass-through certificates, and corporate debt securities. Municipal bonds are a type of security issued by a state, municipality or county to finance its capital expenditures. Municipal bonds are typically exempt from federal taxes and from most state taxes in which they are issued. Municipal bonds may be general obligations of the issuer or secured by specific revenues. General obligation bonds are unsecured and backed by the full faith and credit of the municipality and are paid off with funds from taxes and other fees. Revenue bonds are used to fund projects that will eventually create revenue directly, such as a toll road or lease payments for a new building. Municipal bonds have traditionally had very low rates of default as they are backed either by government power to tax or revenue. Mortgage-backed securities are asset-backed securities that represent a claim on the cash flows from mortgage loans through securitization. Mortgage-backed securities are typically pass-through in nature with repayment of principal and interest to the security holder occurring over the life of the security. REMICs (real estate mortgage investment conduits) represent a participation interest in a pool of mortgages. REMICs are created by redirecting the cash flows from the pool of mortgages underlying those securities to create two or more classes (or tranches) with different maturity or risk characteristics designed to meet a variety of investor needs and preferences. REMICs may be sponsored by U.S. Government agencies and Government-sponsored enterprises. We also invested in corporate debt and are subject to credit risk related to pooled trust preferred insurance company term obligations. Corporate debt securities generally have greater credit risk than Government-sponsored enterprises securities, but generally have higher yields than government securities of similar duration. Therefore, we limit the amount of the portfolio based on these concerns. Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to provide collateral for pledging requirements, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide an alternate source of investment when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Our board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the investment policy and appointment of the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee is responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring our investment performance. Individual investment transactions are reviewed and ratified by the board of directors on a monthly basis. K-6 Table of Contents Insurance Activities We conduct insurance brokerage activities through our 80%-owned subsidiary, Exchange Underwriters. Exchange Underwriters is a full-service, independent insurance agency that offers property and casualty, commercial liability, surety and other insurance products for small businesses and individuals through over 25 insurance carriers. Exchange Underwriters is licensed in more than 35 states. In addition to serving businesses and individuals in the Pittsburgh metropolitan areas, Exchange Underwriters has developed specialty programs that are sold nationwide. Exchange Underwriters generates revenues primarily from commissions paid by insurance companies with respect to the placement of insurance products. Commission revenue includes contingent commissions, which are commissions paid by an insurance carrier that are based on the overall profit and/or volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year. Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds General. Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and economic conditions. Deposits. Substantially all of our depositors are residents of Pennsylvania. Deposits are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit products such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit (including individual retirement accounts). We consider demand deposits, savings accounts and money market accounts to be core deposits. Deposit products are supported by services including online banking, bill pay and telephone banking. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, liquidity needs, profitability, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing semi-monthly. Our current strategy is to offer competitive rates on all types of deposit products. In addition to accounts for individuals, we also offer deposit accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area. Our business banking deposit products include commercial checking accounts, money market accounts, sweep and insured money sweep services, online banking with bill pay and automated clearinghouse, as well as remote electronic deposit. At December 31, 2012, we did not have any brokered deposits. Borrowings. We utilize advances from the FHLB and, to a limited extent, repurchase agreements to supplement our supply of investable funds. The Bank also has the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve based upon eligible collateral and has two unsecured discretionary lines of credit with other financial institutions. The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States or Government-sponsored enterprises), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institutions net worth or on the FHLBs assessment of the institutions creditworthiness. Personnel At December 31, 2012, we had 85 full-time equivalent employees, including 17 employees of our insurance agency subsidiary, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. K-7 Table of Contents Subsidiaries FedFirst Financials only direct subsidiary is First Federal Savings Bank.

K-8 Table of Contents REGULATION AND SUPERVISION General First Federal Savings Bank, as a federal savings association, is currently subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as its primary federal regulator, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the insurer of its deposits. First Federal is a member of the FHLB System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. First Federal must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the OCC to evaluate First Federals safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse effect on FedFirst Financial and First Federal and their operations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) made extensive changes to the regulation of First Federal. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated and responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings associations such as First Federal was transferred to the OCC on July 21, 2011. The OCC is the agency that is primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as First Federal, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their prudential regulators. Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to First Federal and FedFirst Financial are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on First Federal and FedFirst Financial. Capital Requirements The applicable capital regulations require savings associations to meet three minimum capital standards: a 1.5% tangible capital to total assets ratio, a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio (3% for institutions receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS examination rating system) and an 8% risk-based capital ratio. In addition, the prompt corrective action standards discussed below also establish, in effect, a minimum 2% tangible capital standard, a 4% leverage ratio (3% for institutions receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS system) and, together with the risk-based capital standard itself, a 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital standard. The regulations also require that, in meeting the tangible, leverage and risk-based capital standards, institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities as principal that are not permissible for a national bank. K-9 Table of Contents The risk-based capital standard for savings associations requires the maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital less certain specified deductions from total capital such as reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital instruments and equity investments) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet activities, recourse obligations, residual interests and direct credit substitutes, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor assigned by the capital regulation based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Tier 1 (core) capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. The components of supplementary capital (Tier 2 capital) include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible debt securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45% of unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Overall, the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. The OCC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institutions capital level is or may become inadequate in light of the particular risks or circumstances. At December 31, 2012, First Federal met each of its capital requirements. Savings and loan holding companies are not currently subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, requires the FRB to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies, including savings and loan holding companies, that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. On August 30, 2012, the federal banking agencies issued proposed rules that would implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010, and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements. The proposed rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which would be phased in from 2013 to 2019, and would revise the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. The proposed new minimum capital level requirements applicable to FedFirst Financial and First Federal under the proposals would be: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The proposed rules would eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from tier 1 capital. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less and phased out over a period of 10 years ending in 2022. The proposed rules would also establish a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. Federal Banking Regulation Business Activities. The activities of federal savings banks, such as First Federal, are governed by federal laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the business activities in which federal savings banks may engage. In particular, certain lending authority for federal savings banks, e.g., commercial, non-residential real property loans and consumer loans, is limited to a specified percentage of the institutions capital or assets. K-10 Table of Contents Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept broker deposits. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institutions degree of undercapitalization. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The OCC could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures. Insurance of Deposit Accounts. First Federals deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Under the FDICs existing risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institutions assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. Assessment rates range from seven to 77.5 basis points on the institutions assessment base, which is calculated as total assets minus tangible equity. Deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000. The FDIC adopted an optional Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program by which, for a fee, non-interest bearing transaction accounts would receive unlimited insurance coverage until December 31, 2010, which was later extended to December 31, 2012. First Federal opted to participate in the unlimited coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of First Federal. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. Loans to One Borrower. Federal law provides that savings associations are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, a savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral. Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Federal law requires savings associations to meet a qualified thrift lender test. Under the test, a savings association is required to either qualify as a domestic building and loan association under the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its portfolio assets (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain qualified thrift investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities but also including education, credit card and small business loans) in at least nine months out of each 12-month period. A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to certain operating restrictions, including dividend limitations. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the qualified thrift lender test a violation of law that could result in an enforcement action. As of December 31, 2012, First Federal maintained 80.23% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and maintained at least 65% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments in each of the previous 12 months, therefore, meeting the qualified thrift lender test. K-11 Table of Contents Limitation on Capital Distributions. Federal regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a savings association, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase its shares and payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger. Under the regulations, an application to and the prior approval of the OCC is required before any capital distribution if the institution does not meet the criteria for expedited treatment of applications under OCC regulations (i.e., generally, examination and Community Reinvestment Act ratings in the two top categories), the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceed net income for that year plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with the OCC. If an application is not required, the institution must still provide 30 days prior written notice to the FRB of the capital distribution if, like First Federal, it is a subsidiary of a holding company, as well as an informational notice filing to the OCC. If First Federals capital ever fell below its regulatory requirements or the OCC notified it that it was in need of increased supervision, its ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the OCC could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the OCC determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Community Reinvestment Act. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institutions failure to satisfactorily comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in denials of regulatory applications. Responsibility for administering the Community Reinvestment Act, unlike other fair lending laws, is not being transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. First Federal received a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination. Transactions with Related Parties. Federal law limits First Federals authority to engage in transactions with affiliates (e.g., any entity that controls or is under common control with First Federal, including FedFirst Financial and their other subsidiaries). The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings association. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings associations capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must generally be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings associations are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings association may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by FedFirst Financial to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, First Federals authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (insiders), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The laws limit both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that First Federal may make to insiders based, in part, on First Federals capital level and requires that certain board approval procedures be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved. K-12 Table of Contents Enforcement. The OCC currently has primary enforcement responsibility over savings associations and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors to institution of receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1.0 million per day in especially egregious cases. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations. FHLB System. First Federal is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 12 regional FHLBs. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. First Federal, as a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB. First Federal was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB of Pittsburgh stock at December 31, 2012 of $3.8 million. Federal Reserve System. The FRB regulations require savings associations to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal and regular checking accounts). For 2013, the regulations provided that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $71.0 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $71.0 million. The first $11.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the FRB) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually and, for 2013, require a 3% ratio for up to $79.5 million and an exemption of $12.4 million. First Federal complies with the foregoing requirements. Other Regulations First Federals operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, including the: · Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; · Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; · Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; · Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and · Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. The operations of First Federal also are subject to laws such as the: · Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; · Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and · Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check. K-13 Table of Contents Holding Company Regulation General. As a savings and loan holding company, FedFirst Financial is subject to FRB regulations, examinations, supervision, reporting requirements and regulations regarding its activities. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over FedFirst Financial and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to First Federal. FedFirst Financial is a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of federal law. As a unitary savings and loan holding company that was in existence prior to May 4, 1999, FedFirst Financial is generally not restricted as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that First Federal continues to be a qualified thrift lender. Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from, directly or indirectly or through one or more subsidiaries, acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings association, or savings and loan holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the FRB or from acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary holding company or savings association. A savings and loan holding company is also prohibited from acquiring more than 5% of a company engaged in activities other than those authorized by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the FRB must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. The FRB is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state, except: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and (ii) the acquisition of a savings association in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings association specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act also extends the source of strength doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must promulgate regulations implementing the source of strength policy that holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. Dividends. The FRB has the power to prohibit dividends by savings and loan holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which also applies to savings and loan holding companies and which expresses the FRBs view that a holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the companys net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the companys capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the FRB may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding companys bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized. Acquisition of FedFirst Financial. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect control of a savings and loan holding company or savings association. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the company or institution, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change of control of FedFirst Financial. Under the Change in Control Act, the FRB generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company. K-14 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The current economic conditions pose significant challenges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends to a large degree on the general economic conditions in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Our market has experienced a significant downturn in which we have seen falling home prices, rising foreclosures and an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies. If economic conditions do not improve or continue to decline, we could experience reduced demand for our products and services, increased problem assets and foreclosures and increased loan losses, each of which could further adversely affect our business. We could experience further adverse consequences in the event of a prolonged economic downturn in our market due to our exposure to commercial loans across various lines of business. A prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect collateral values or cash flows of the borrowing businesses, and as a result our primary source of repayment could be insufficient to service the debt. Another adverse consequence in the event of a prolonged economic downturn in our market could be the loss of collateral value on commercial and real estate loans that are secured by real estate located in our market area. A further significant decline in real estate values in our market would mean that the collateral for many of our loans would provide less security. As a result, we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans because our ability to fully recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would be diminished. Future economic conditions in our market will depend on factors outside of our control such as political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government, military and fiscal policies and inflation. Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings. Our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding. Changes in interest rates  up or down  could adversely affect our net interest spread and, as a result, our net interest income and net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract. This contraction could be more severe following a prolonged period of lower interest rates, as a larger proportion of our fixed rate residential loan portfolio will have been originated at those lower rates and borrowers may be more reluctant or unable to sell their homes in a higher interest rate environment. Changes in the slope of the yield curve  or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates  could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. Our emphasis on residential mortgage loans exposes us to a risk of loss due to a decline in property values. At December 31, 2012, $120.9 million, or 47.4%, of our loan portfolio consisted of residential mortgage loans, and $49.4 million, or 19.3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans. Home equity loans are generally originated with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less and, on occasion, are originated with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80%. Until 2007, such loans were offered with combined loan-to-value ratios of up to 125%. Recent declines in the housing market have resulted in declines in real estate values in our market areas. These declines in real estate values could cause some of our mortgage and home equity loans to be inadequately collateralizedparticularly those home equity loans that were originated with combined loan-to-value ratios in excess of 100%  which would expose us to a greater risk of loss in the event that we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral. K-15 Table of Contents Commercial lending and the unseasoned nature of our commercial loan portfolio may expose us to increased lending risks. At December 31, 2012, $81.1 million, or 31.7%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial construction loans and commercial business loans. Commercial lending is an important part of our business strategy, and we expect this portion of our loan portfolio to continue to grow. Commercial loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the borrowers business. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential mortgage loans. Many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan. In addition, many of our commercial real estate and commercial business loans are unseasoned, meaning that they were originated recently. Our limited experience with these loans does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our expectations, which could negatively affect our future performance. Higher loan losses could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings. When we loan money we incur the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable-rate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to repay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. In addition, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios. In addition, our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our primary regulator, the OCC, as part of its examination process, which may result in the establishment of an additional allowance based upon the judgment of the OCC after a review of the information available at the time of its examination. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to 1.13% of total loans outstanding and 131% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2012, may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings. Our purchase of out-of-state loans may expose us to increased lending risks. Prior to 2006, we purchased newly originated residential and multi-family real estate loans secured by properties throughout the United States in order to supplement our own loan originations. At December 31, 2012, we had $10.2 million of purchased residential mortgage loans, of which $763,000 were non-performing, and $4.2 million of purchased multi-family real estate loans, of which all were performing. $6.3 million of the residential loans are located in Michigan and Ohio, which have experienced high levels of unemployment and were significantly impacted by the economic downturn. It is difficult to assess the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio because the properties securing these loans are located outside of our market area, which makes them more difficult to monitor. We can give no assurance that these loans will not have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which would adversely affect our future performance. K-16 Table of Contents If we conclude that the decline in value of any of our investment securities is other-than-temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2012, our investment portfolio included four securities with unrealized losses of $2.1 million that we considered for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). We evaluate our securities portfolio for OTTI throughout the year. Each investment that has a fair value less than book value is reviewed on a quarterly basis. An impairment charge is recorded against individual securities if management concludes that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. Any charges for OTTI would not impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. Included in securities with unrealized losses are three trust preferred securities with an amortized cost of $4.0 million and a fair value of $1.9 million at December 31, 2012. The trust preferred securities were issued by two issuer pools consisting of insurance companies. A number of factors or combinations of factors could cause us to conclude in future reporting periods that these securities have experienced OTTI. These factors include, but are not limited to, failure to make scheduled interest payments, an increase in the unrealized loss on a particular security, an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions, and industry or issuer-specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery of the amortized cost basis. Our inability to retain deposits as they become due may cause us to rely more heavily on wholesale funding strategies, which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating margins and profitability. A large percentage of our certificates of deposit have maturities of less than one year. The Bank has marketing and pricing initiatives to retain these certificates of deposit when they mature, however, there can be no guarantee that we will retain the deposits necessary to continue to fund asset growth at reasonable prices. If we are not able to maintain sufficient deposits, we will have to rely more heavily on wholesale strategies to fund our asset growth, which historically are more expensive than retail sources of funding. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. We do not control the premiums on which our insurance commissions are based, and volatility or declines in premiums may negatively impact the revenues of our insurance agency. Exchange Underwriters derives most of its revenues from commissions for brokerage services. We do not determine insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Fluctuations in premiums charged by the insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on Exchange Underwriters results of operations. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels, as commissions are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insured. Due to their cyclical nature, insurance premiums may vary widely between periods. Such variations can have a potentially material impact on our commission revenues. Contingent commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions, and any decrease in the amount of contingent commissions received by Exchange Underwriters could adversely affect its results of operations. Exchange Underwriters derives a portion of its revenues from contingent commissions paid by insurance companies. Contingent commissions are special revenue-sharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, Exchange Underwriters is unable to meet insurance companies profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves, over which Exchange Underwriters has no control, actual contingent commissions received by Exchange Underwriters could be less than anticipated, which could negatively affect Exchange Underwriters revenues. K-17 Table of Contents Strong competition within our market area could reduce our profits and slow growth. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and at times has forced us to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. As of June 30, 2012, which is the most recent date for which information is available, we held 0.25% of the deposits in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area and 1.79% of the deposits in the counties in which our offices are located. Several of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area. Our market area limits our growth potential. Our offices are located primarily in small industrial communities in the southern suburban area of metropolitan Pittsburgh. Most of these communities have experienced population and economic decline as a result of the decline of the United States steel industry. Because we have an aging customer base and there is little new real estate development in several of the communities where our offices are located, the opportunities for originating loans and growing deposits in our primary market area are limited. If we are unable to grow our business it will be difficult for us to increase our earnings. Our branching strategy may not be successful. A key component of our strategy to grow and improve profitability is to expand into communities that are experiencing population growth and economic expansion while also successfully servicing the small industrial communities in what has historically been our primary footprint. In 2006, we opened a new branch in Peters Township in Washington County, Pennsylvania. In 2007, we opened a new branch located in the downtown area of Washington, Pennsylvania. In 2011 and 2012, we consolidated two branches due to the close proximity of other branch locations. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in increasing the volume of our loans and deposits by expanding our branch network into communities experiencing growth. Building and/or staffing new branch offices will increase our operating expenses. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage the costs and implementation risks associated with this strategy so that expansion of our branch network will be profitable. We are dependent upon the services of key executives. We rely heavily on our President and Chief Executive Officer, Patrick G. OBrien. We also rely heavily on the President of Exchange Underwriters, Richard B. Boyer, to manage our insurance operations. The loss of Mr. OBrien or Mr. Boyer could have a material adverse impact on our operations because, as a small company, we have fewer management-level personnel that have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. Changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have employment agreements with Messrs. OBrien and Boyer. We maintain life insurance covering Mr. Boyer under a bank-owned life insurance program. We operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB, which regulates savings and loan holding companies, the OCC, which regulates all national banks and federal savings associations, and by the FDIC, as our insurer of our deposits. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. K-18 Table of Contents Recently enacted regulatory reform may have a material impact on our operations. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, restructured the regulation of depository institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which previously regulated the Bank, was merged into the OCC, which until then only regulated national banks. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies, including FedFirst Financial, are now regulated by the FRB. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new federal agency to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws, a function that was formerly performed by the depository institution regulators. The federal preemption of state laws previously accorded federally chartered depository institutions has been reduced, and State Attorneys General now have greater authority to bring a suit against a federally chartered institution, such as the Bank, for violations of certain state and federal consumer protection laws. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking regulators have proposed new consolidated capital requirements, which will limit our ability to borrow at the holding company level and invest the proceeds from such borrowings as capital in the Bank that could be leveraged to support additional growth. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various other provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in 2008-2009. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations will not be known for years until regulations implementing the statute are written and adopted. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. In addition to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal regulatory agencies have taken stronger supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan losses and other weaknesses as a result of the recent economic crisis. The actions include the entering into of written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations. Federal bank regulators recently have also been using with more frequency their ability to impose individual minimal capital requirements on banks, which requirements may be higher than those imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act or which would otherwise qualify the bank as being well capitalized under the FDICs prompt corrective action regulations. If we were to become subject to a supervisory agreement or higher individual capital requirements, such action may have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business plans, as well as our ability to grow, pay dividends or engage in mergers and acquisitions and may result in restrictions in our operations. Increased and/or special FDIC assessments will hurt our earnings. The recent economic recession has caused a high level of bank failures, which has dramatically increased FDIC resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the balance of the Deposit Insurance Fund. As a result, the FDIC imposed a one-time special assessment and significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance. Increases in the base assessment rate have increased our deposit insurance costs in recent years and negatively impacted our earnings. Additional increases in the base assessment rate or special assessments would negatively impact our earnings. We own stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh, which has experienced financial difficulties. Our agreement with the FHLB of Pittsburgh requires us to purchase capital stock in the FHLB commensurate with the amount of our advances and unused borrowing capacity. This stock is carried at cost and was $3.8 million at December 31, 2012. If the FHLB of Pittsburgh is unable to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements or is required to aid the remaining FHLBs, our holding of FHLB stock may be determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired and may require a charge to our earnings, which could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, while the FHLB resumed paying dividends and making capital stock repurchases in February 2012, capital stock repurchases and dividends from member banks are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the FHLB and could be discontinued in the future. Repurchases of excess capital stock have also been limited and are determined on a quarterly basis. The absence of a dividend, limitations on the redemption of our FHLB stock, and the obligation to increase our investment in the FHLB would hurt our interest income. K-19 Table of Contents We are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us. Our business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.
