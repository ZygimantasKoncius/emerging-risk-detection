Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. Because of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline. We depend on our key management and product development personnel. Our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with ZelnickMedia. In 2008, we amended our existing management agreement with ZelnickMedia whereby it has agreed to provide executive management services to us and our Board through October 31, 2012. We entered into this amendment in order to secure management resources which we believe will allow us to grow our business and take advantage of opportunities in the interactive entertainment marketplace. Our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and an Executive Vice President are partners of ZelnickMedia. We are also highly dependent on the expertise, skills and knowledge of certain of our Rockstar employees responsible for content creation and development of our Grand Theft Auto titles and titles based on other brands. Although we entered into new long-term employment agreements with members of the creative team of our Rockstar Games publishing label, we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels, or at all. The loss of the services of our executive officers, ZelnickMedia or our key Rockstar employees could significantly harm our business. In addition, if one or more key employees join a competitor or form a competing company, we may lose additional personnel, experience material interruptions in product development, delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors, suppliers and customers, which could significantly harm our business. Failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects. We are dependent on the future success of our Grand Theft Auto products and we must continue to publish "hit" titles or sequels to such "hit" titles in order to compete successfully in our industry. Grand Theft Auto and certain of our other titles are "hit" products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. If we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful "hit" titles or sequels to such "hit" titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our "hit" titles or their sequels, our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses. For the years ended October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our Grand Theft Auto titles accounted for 46.2%, 13.1% and 22.4% of our net revenue, respectively, and our 10 best selling titles accounted for approximately 64.2%, 26.6% and 38.4% of our net revenue, respectively. In addition, competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry. Hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate, which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations. If our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value (such as pay-for-play or subscription-based models), or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and well-received products and services, our revenue and profitability may decline. We may not fully realize the anticipated benefits resulting from the recently completed reorganization of our executive management team and our business. During the second quarter of 2007, five new members and one incumbent director were elected to our Board at our annual meeting. Our Board then elected a new Chairman and a new Chief Executive Officer, and also appointed one additional incumbent member and one additional new member to our Board, for a 10 total of eight board members. During that quarter we also engaged ZelnickMedia, a media investment and management firm, to provide us with executive management services. The Board and ZelnickMedia initiated a reorganization of our executive management team and our business in fiscal 2007. While we substantially completed the reorganization in the past fiscal year, it is not yet possible to assess completely how effective our new management team will be, whether it will be able to accomplish the objectives of our new business development plan or whether our business reorganization plan will be of significant benefit to us and our financial performance. In addition, the success of our business plan depends in part on events and circumstances that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, consumer demand for our products and other factors affecting our industry. Our business is highly dependent on the continued growth of current generation video game platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sony's PLAYSTATION 3, PlayStation 2 and PSP, Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii and DS. The success of our business is dependent upon the continued growth of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. If the average price of our prior generation software titles continues to decline or if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on current generation titles, our operating results may suffer. The interactive entertainment software and hardware industry is characterized by the introduction of new and enhanced generations of products and evolving industry standards. Consumer demand for software for prior generation platforms has declined as newer and more advanced hardware platforms achieve market acceptance. As the gaming software industry continues to transition to current generation platforms, we expect prior generation titles will not be able to command premium prices and we expect that these titles will be subject to price reductions earlier in their product life cycles than we experienced in prior years. As a result, we have reduced prices for our prior generation software titles and we expect to continue to reduce prices for such software titles, which will have a negative impact on our operating results. These changes may cause the value of our inventory to decline substantially or to become obsolete. Current generation titles for the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii have been offered at premium retail prices since the launch of such consoles. We expect to continue to price current generation titles at a premium level. However, circumstances may arise in which we may need to reduce prices for such titles. For example, the recent economic turmoil may reduce consumer demand and require us to reduce prices on our current generation titles. If we are unable to sustain launch pricing on these current generation titles, it will have a material adverse effect on our margins, profitability and results of operations. The market for our titles is characterized by short product life cycles. The inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The market for video games is characterized by short product lives and frequent introductions of new products. New products may not achieve significant market acceptance, generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development, manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products. The life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenue associated with an initial product launch generally constitutes a high percentage of the total revenue associated with the life of a product, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations. 11 Our distribution business is dependent on suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis. Our ability to obtain particular products in required quantities and to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is important to the success of our distribution business. In most cases, we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with suppliers. Our distribution business has experienced, and may in the future experience, significant supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain manufacturers to supply products, such as the newest generation of platforms, on a timely basis. Further, manufacturers or publishers that currently distribute their products through us may decide to distribute, or to substantially increase their existing distribution, through other distributors, or directly to retailers. If we cannot obtain sufficient supplies of the products that we distribute, our net revenue could decline and we could incur losses. We rely on a primary distribution service provider for a significant portion of our products and the failure of this service provider to perform as expected could materially harm our results of operations. In September 2008, we entered into a distribution services agreement with Ditan Distribution LLC, under which Ditan assumed responsibility for the shipping, receiving, warehouse management and related functions for our United States publishing and distribution businesses. We sell our products to our customers in the United States primarily through this distribution services agreement with Ditan. Our future performance will depend, in part, on Ditan's ability to successfully distribute our products. If Ditan does not perform adequately, or if we lose Ditan as our distributor and are unable to obtain a satisfactory replacement in a timely manner, our sales and results of operations could suffer. We may need to raise additional capital if we incur losses. Although we achieved profitability for the year ended October 31, 2008, we have incurred significant losses in the past. If we incur losses in the future, we may be required to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations. We could seek to raise capital in a number of ways, including through the issuance of debt or equity, or through other financing arrangements. During the year ended October 31, 2007, we entered into a senior secured line of credit agreement (and expanded the line of credit in November 2007), which requires us to make periodic interest or other debt service payments. If we borrow additional funds, further debt service payments would probably be necessary. In addition, the terms of additional debt may impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business. If we seek financing through the sale of equity securities, our current stockholders will suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of common stock. We cannot be certain as to our ability to raise additional capital in the future or under what terms capital would be available, particularly in light of the recent economic turmoil which has, among other consequences, led to the depression of stock prices and the tightening of credit. If we need to raise capital and are not successful in doing so, we will have to consider other options that may include, but are not limited to, a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development, reductions in overhead expenses, and sales of intellectual property and other assets. These actions, should they become necessary, will likely result in a reduction in the size of our operations and could materially affect the prospects of our business. Our ability to raise additional capital may be limited. Recent disruptions in financial markets have resulted in a severe tightening of credit availability in the United States. Liquidity in credit markets has contracted significantly, making terms for certain financings less attractive. Ongoing turmoil in the credit markets may make it difficult for us to obtain financing, on acceptable terms or at all, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments. These difficulties could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, paying dividends, repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses. In addition, we have 12 granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts. Accordingly, we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Our credit agreement also requires us to satisfy specified financial and non-financial covenants. A breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and allow our lenders to pursue various remedies, including accelerating the repayment of any indebtedness outstanding under the agreement. Our involvement, and the involvement of some of our former executive officers in a wide variety of lawsuits, investigations and proceedings has had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on us. We and some of our former officers, directors and employees have been, and are subject to, a wide variety of lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, including the following: Former Officers. Our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pled guilty to two felony counts relating to our historical stock option granting practices and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") instituted a civil action against him. In addition, certain other former officers have been convicted of crimes relating to their conduct during their employment with us. Stock Option Granting Practices. In 2006, a Special Committee of our Board of Directors conducted an investigation into our historical stock option granting practices. The Special Committee determined that there were improprieties in the process of granting and documenting stock options and that incorrect measurement dates for some stock option grants had been used for financial reporting purposes. As a result, we recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with respect to some of our stock-based awards and restated certain previously filed financial information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. Several derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in state and federal courts against some of our current and former directors and some of our former executive officers relating to our historical stock option granting practices. FTC Consent Order. We have entered into an agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission that contains a consent order requiring us to maintain a comprehensive system reasonably designed to ensure that all content in our electronic games is considered and reviewed in preparing submissions to a U.S. rating agency. We have also agreed to represent accurately the rating and content descriptors for games we publish and to disclose to consumers the presence of any content relevant to the rating that was not disclosed to the rating authority. Personal Injury Actions. We are named as a defendant in a personal injury and wrongful death action. SEC Investigation. We have received a notice from the SEC that it is conducting a formal investigation into our historical stock option granting practices. We have also received a "Wells" notice informing us of the SEC's intention to file charges against us and seek a civil monetary penalty in connection with this investigation. IRS Request for Information. We have received requests for information from the Internal Revenue Service relating to the granting and exercise of certain stock options and tax deductions taken by us with respect thereto. Electronic Arts Inc.'s Tender Offer. Stockholder lawsuits have been filed against us in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and New York state court contending that our directors breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, allegedly refusing to explore premium offers by Electronic Arts Inc. ("EA") to acquire all of the Company's shares, enacting a bylaw amendment allegedly designed to entrench the current board by preventing stockholders from nominating and electing alternative directors, agreeing to an amendment to a management agreement with ZelnickMedia, issuing a proxy statement for the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders that allegedly contained misleading and incomplete information 13 and adopting a "poison pill". Other lawsuits may continue to be filed against us and our directors with similar or additional allegations relating to our 2008 annual meeting of stockholders and the proxy materials filed with the SEC and mailed to stockholders in connection therewith, the amendment to the ZelnickMedia management agreement, EA's unsolicited tender offer and/or its expiration, our adoption of a "poison pill," or our review of strategic alternatives. Other Inquiries and Proceedings. We have received grand jury subpoenas issued by the District Attorney of the County of New York and from certain state attorneys general relating to some of our products, our historical stock option granting practices, the termination of our former auditors and other matters. The investigations and charges against us or other current or former officers, directors or employees have imposed, and are likely to continue to impose, significant costs on us financially. While we are unable to estimate the exact nature or amount of these future costs, we believe they will likely include: damage to our reputation and business relationships; professional fees in connection with the conduct of the investigations and the defense of related litigations and other proceedings; potential damages, fines, penalties or settlement costs imposed on us; advancement of certain expenses and reimbursement of certain amounts payable by, or on behalf of, our current and former officers, directors and employees subject to the investigation or named in any litigations or other proceedings pursuant to our indemnification obligations; potential impairment of our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement under existing insurance policies, and a potentially negative impact on our future insurance coverage; and potential impairment in our ability to raise capital. Even if resolved favorably, such litigation or investigations could continue to be time consuming and could continue to result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management team, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the reaction of our employees, stockholders, publishers, developers, customers, distributors, licensors and other business partners to the institution or ultimate resolution of any such proceedings. If we acquire or invest in other businesses, intellectual properties or other assets, we may be unable to integrate them with our business, our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions. If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we may acquire or make investments in businesses, intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic. We may not be able to identify, negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully. Even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business, intellectual property or other asset, such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks, including: retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire; cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization; the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits, including any anticipated operating and product synergies, of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of, or operational difficulties arising from, an acquisition would be greater than anticipated; 14 significant acquisition-related accounting adjustments, particularly relating to an acquired company's deferred revenue, that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their stand-alone revenue and profits; significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizeable acquisition and increased capital expenditures, including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition; the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse impact on the value of the businesses we acquire, including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business; the need to integrate an acquired company's accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting, and the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls, procedures and policies; litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of, an acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers or other third parties; and to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the United States, we face additional risks, including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. Future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equity-linked securities (potentially diluting our existing stockholders), the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, intangibles, or acquired in-process technology, or other increased cash and non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation. Any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a stand-alone basis. Our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments. Our ability to acquire licenses to intellectual property, especially for sports titles, impacts our revenue and profitability. Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs. Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others. For example, our 2K Sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players' associations. Similarly, some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products. Competition for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value, our revenue and profitability could decline significantly. Competition for these licenses may also increase the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability. In addition, on certain intellectual property licenses, we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments, royalties or standards of performance. If such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees, our profitability will be adversely impacted. Our business is dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with third parties. Our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis. We rely on third party software developers for the development of some of our titles. Quality third party developers are continually in high demand. Software developers who have developed titles for us in the 15 past may not be available to develop software for us in the future. Due to the limited number of third party software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them, these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards, if at all. We have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles. These agreements typically require us to make advance payments, pay royalties and satisfy other conditions. Our advance payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully, which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market. Software development costs, promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and third party licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software. Future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover advances to software developers and licensors, and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers. If we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with third party developers and licensors, the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us, and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and operating results. We are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs, and we must adapt to changes in software technologies. We depend on third party software developers and our internal development studios to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections. The development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months. Development times and costs of current generation software have increased substantially as a result of the additional and enhanced features available in the newest games. After development of a product, it may take between 9 to 12 additional months to develop the product for other hardware platforms. If developers experience financial difficulties, additional costs or unanticipated development delays, we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs. Certain of our licensing and marketing agreements also contain provisions that would impose penalties if we fail to meet agreed upon game release dates. There can be no assurance that the products so developed will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products. Additionally, in order to stay competitive, our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development. Any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable. The interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive both for our publishing and distribution operations. We compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms. We also compete with domestic game publishers, such as Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard, THQ and Midway Games and international publishers, such as Capcom, Eidos, Konami, Namco-Bandai, SEGA and Ubisoft. As our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles, which require increasing budgets for development and marketing, the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties. Our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures, television and audio and video products featuring similar themes, online computer programs and other entertainment, which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers. Our distribution business also operates in a highly competitive environment. Competition is based primarily on breadth, availability and quality of product lines; price; terms and conditions of sale; credit terms and availability; speed and accuracy of delivery; and effectiveness of sales and marketing programs. 16 Our competitors include regional, national and international distributors, as well as hardware manufacturers and software publishers. We may lose market share or be forced in the future to reduce our prices in response to our competitors. Our distribution business has been adversely affected by lower sales volume of software titles, the availability of certain hardware products, a decrease in average selling prices of interactive entertainment products as our industry transitions to current generation technology and increased competition in the value software market. A number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the Internet. If technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially, it could result in a decline in our platform-based software sales and negatively impact sales of our products. Increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles. Retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support. Competition for retail shelf space is expected to increase, which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles. Competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers. Accordingly, we may not be able, or we may have to pay more than our competitors, to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space. A limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt our business. A substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers. Sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 40.2%, 51.1% and 49.4% of our net revenue for the years ended October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, with GameStop accounting for 13.1% of net revenue for the year ended October 31, 2008. Our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without long-term agreements or other commitments, and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time. Certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content. The loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers, including as a result of a product being rated "AO" (age 18 and over), could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Furthermore, our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy, become insolvent or be liquidated due to the recent turmoil in the economy, the global contraction of credit or for other factors. Bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business, including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers. Returns of our products by our customers and price concessions granted to our customers may adversely affect our operating results. We are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers. Our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations to customers, which include credits and returns, when demand for specific products falls below expectations. We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions. While we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and price concessions, if return rates and price concessions for our products exceed our reserves, our revenue could decline. 17 We submit our products for rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board ("ESRB") in the United States and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries. Failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively impact our ability to distribute and sell those games, as could the re-rating of a game for any reason. We voluntarily submit our game products to the ESRB, a U.S.-based non-profit and independent ratings organization. The ESRB system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors, such as graphic violence, profanity or sexually explicit material. The ESRB may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games, including revocation of a rating or monetary fines up to $1 million. Other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. We believe that we comply with rating system requirements and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions. In some instances, we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating, which could delay or disrupt the release of our products. In addition, some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries, such as Germany. In the United States, we develop software titles that we intend to receive ESRB ratings of "E" (age 6 and older), "E10+" (age 10 and older), "T" (age 13 and older) or "M" (age 17 and older). In addition to these ratings, the ESRB may also rate a game as "AO" (age 18 and older). Platform licensors may not certify a game rated "AO" and retailers may refuse to sell "AO" games or games with controversial content. For instance, in 2007, some retailers reacted to the controversy over Manhunt 2 by refusing to sell it or refusing to sell it in brick and mortar stores. In addition, some consumers have reacted to re-ratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased, and refraining from buying other games published by us. We have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the ESRB and other ratings organizations. Nonetheless, these processes are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding and reasonable resource constraints. If a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content, the ESRB could re-rate a game, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers, and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money. This could have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be exposed to litigation, administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed, which could impact sales of other video games we sell. If any of these consequences were to occur, our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed. Many of our Rockstar titles and certain of our 2K Games titles have been rated "M" by the ESRB. If we are unable to obtain "M" ratings and instead receive "AO" ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the ESRB's ratings standards or for other reasons, including the adoption of legislation in this area, our business and prospects could be negatively affected. If any of our games are re-rated by the ESRB or other foreign based ratings organizations, we could be exposed to litigation, administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities, and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly impacted. Our business and products are subject to potential legislation. The adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products. Several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry. Such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of "M" rated, "AO" rated and "Rating Pending" products to under-17 audiences (while the ESRB rating recommends an appropriate age group, there is currently no legal prohibition on any game sales). If any such proposals are enacted into law, it may limit the potential market for our "M" rated products in the United States, and adversely affect our operating results. Other countries, such as Germany, have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current United States laws. In the United States, proposals have also been 18 made by numerous state legislators to regulate the sale of "M" or "AO" rated products and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violence or sexual materials to under 17 or 18 audiences. While such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups, the adoption into law of such legislation in federal and/or in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for our "M" rated titles. Content policies adopted by retailers, consumer opposition and litigation could negatively impact sales of our products. Retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses. If retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content, or if any of our previously "M" rated series products are rated "AO," we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series, which in the case of our best selling Grand Theft Auto titles could seriously affect our business. Consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes, violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns. Additionally, although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of video games have been unsuccessful in the courts, claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future. See "Item 3.Legal Proceedings." We cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors. We are required to obtain licenses from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, which are also our competitors, to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms. Our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a title-by-title basis. As a result, the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms, our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and, accordingly, our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms, may be limited. If a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term, or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles, we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensor's platform. Termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects. Certain platform licensors have retained the right to change fee structures for online gameplay, and each licensor's ability to set royalty rates makes it difficult for us to forecast our costs. Increased costs could negatively impact our operating margins. We may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business. Our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of "hit" titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. We have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results. The release of a "hit" title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales. In addition, the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter (our fourth and first fiscal quarters), due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday buying season. Demand for and sales of our sports titles are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the sport season which they depict. Our failure or inability to produce "hit" titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business and operating results. The uncertainties associated with software development, manufacturing lead times, production delays and the 19 approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations. If we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software, the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed. We develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties. We attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and distribution. Our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary. Well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years, resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the Internet. Although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software, piracy of our products could negatively impact our future profitability. Data breaches involving the source code for our products could adversely affect our revenues. We securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created. A breach, whether physical, electronic or otherwise, of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data is stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software. If we are subject to data security breaches, we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. If we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be adversely affected. With advances in technology, game content and software graphics are expected to continue to become more realistic. As a result, we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of third party developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur. Any claims of infringement, with or without merit, could be time consuming, costly and difficult to defend. Moreover, intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products, obtain a license or redesign our products, which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays. Our software is susceptible to errors, which can harm our financial results and reputation. The technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products. As software products become more complex, the risk of undetected errors in new products increases. We may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors, which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products. If, despite testing, errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made, we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance, product returns, loss of revenue, increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation. 20 Gross margins relating to our distribution business have historically been narrow, which increases the impact of variations in costs on our operating results. As a result of intense price competition, our gross margins in our distribution business have historically been narrow and may continue to be narrow in the future. Accordingly, slight variations in operating costs and expenses could result in losses in our distribution business from period to period. We may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand. A significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is attributable to expenses for personnel and facilities. In the event of a significant decline in revenue, we may not be able to dispose of facilities, reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs. Management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit. Moreover, reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future. We are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade, including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar. Sales in international markets, primarily in Europe, have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. We have also recently expanded our Asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base. Sales in international markets accounted for approximately 40.7%, 31.3% and 39.4%, respectively, of our net revenue for the years ended October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays, and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results. All of our international sales are made in local currencies, which could fluctuate against the dollar. While we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk, our results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Our business may be affected by issues in the economy that affect consumer spending. Most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. We believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. This makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. Certain economic conditions such as U.S. or international general economic downturns, including periods of increased inflation, unemployment levels, tax rates, interest rates, gasoline and other energy prices or declining consumer confidence could reduce consumer spending. Reduced consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases, including purchases of products like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. If economic conditions worsen, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price of our common stock historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors under this Item 1A as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material, to changes in securities analysts' earnings estimates or ratings, to our results or future 21 financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts' and investors' expectations, to factors affecting the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics industries, or to national or international economic conditions. Stock markets, in general, have experienced over the years, and continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. We face risks from our international operations. We are subject to certain risks because of our international operations, particularly as we seek to grow our business and presence outside of the United States. Changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales. Trade legislation in either the United States or other countries, such as a change in the current tariff structures, import/export compliance laws or other trade laws or policies, could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by United States laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and by local laws, such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves. The frequency of accounting policy changes may continue to accelerate. For example, standards regarding software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services. We expect that a significant portion of our games will be online-enabled in the future, and we could be required to recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue, could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows. Due to recent economic turmoil and a general depression in stock prices, we could become the target of an unsolicited offer to acquire our shares of common stock. An unsolicited offer could create volatility in our stock price, could create a distraction for our management and employees, and could cause uncertainty that may adversely affect our business. Due to significant price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets recently, we may become an attractive target for an unsolicited bid for shares of our common stock. An unsolicited bid for shares of our common stock would be a distraction for our management and employees, and require the expenditure of significant time and resources by us and could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly. An unsolicited bid could also adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain employees and our ability to enter into agreements with potential business partners. For example, in 2008, Electronic Arts Inc. ("EA") 22 launched an unsolicited tender offer to acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock. EA's unsolicited tender offer caused our stock price to fluctuate significantly, was a significant distraction for our management, created uncertainty for our employees, and created uncertainty for current and potential publishers, developers, distributors and other business partners. Furthermore, stockholder litigation in connection with EA's unsolicited tender offer resulted in, and continues to result in, significant legal costs. If we were to become the target of another unsolicited offer, whether from EA or another party, we could be subject to any of the aforementioned concerns which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
