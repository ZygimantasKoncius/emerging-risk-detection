D. Risk Factors You should consider the following risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report. We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business. In general, you take more risk when you invest in the securities of issuers in emerging markets such as Argentina than when you invest in the securities of issuers in the United States. You should understand that an investment in our common shares, ADSs and warrants involves a high degree of risk, including the possibility of loss of your entire investment. 12 Table of Contents Risks Related to Argentina Argentinas recent growth may not be sustainable. The Argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in recent decades, characterized by periods of low or negative growth, high inflation and currency devaluation. During 2001 and 2002, Argentina experienced a period of severe political, economic and social crisis, which caused a significant economic contraction and led to radical changes in government policies. Although the economy has recovered significantly since then, uncertainty remains as to whether the recent growth is sustainable, since it has depended, to a significant extent, on favorable exchange rates, high commodity prices and excess capacity. The recovery, however, has resulted in inflation and has intensified the countrys need for capital investment, with many sectors, in particular the energy sector, operating near full capacity. Additionally, the global financial crisis and economic downturn has had a significant adverse impact on the countrys performance and could remain a factor in the foreseeable future. Commodities prices, particularly those related to Argentine exports such as soybean have declined significantly recently. Moreover, the countrys relative stability since 2002 has been affected recently, by increased political tension and government intervention in the economy. Our business depends to a significant extent on macroeconomic and political conditions in Argentina. We cannot assure you that Argentinas recent growth will continue. Deterioration in the countrys economy situation would likely have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Continuing inflation may have an adverse effect on the economy. The devaluation of the Peso in January 2002 created pressures on the domestic price system that generated high inflation throughout 2002, before inflation substantially stabilizing in 2003. However, inflationary pressures have since reemerged with consumer prices increasing by 12.3% in 2005. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, inflation was 9.8%, 8.5% and 7.2%, respectively, in part due to actions implemented by the Argentine government to control inflation, which included limitations on exports and price arrangements agreed to with private sector companies. However, in spite of this decline in inflation, uncertainty surrounding future inflation may impact the countrys growth. According to the Argentine Statistics and Census Agency, or INDEC, consumer prices increased by 5.8% during the first ten months of 2009. In the past, inflation has undermined the Argentine economy and the governments ability to create conditions conducive to growth. A return to a high inflation environment would impact in the long term credit market and real estate market and may also affect Argentinas foreign competitiveness by diluting the effects of the Peso devaluation and negatively impacting the level of economic activity and employment. If inflation remains high or continues to rise, Argentinas economy may be negatively impacted and our business could be adversely affected. There are concerns about the accuracy of Argentinas official inflation statistics. In January 2007, INDEC modified its methodology used to calculate the consumer price index, which is calculated as the monthly average of a weighted basket of consumer goods and services that reflects the pattern of consumption of Argentine households. Several economists as well as the international and Argentine press have suggested that this change in methodology was related to the Argentine governments policy aimed at curbing inflation. At the time that INDEC adopted this change in methodology; the Argentine government also replaced several key personnel at INDEC, prompting complaints of governmental interference from the technical staff at INDEC. In addition, the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, has requested that the government clarify its inflation rates. In June 2008, INDEC published a new consumer price index that eliminated nearly half of the items included in previous surveys and introduces adjustable weightings for fruit, vegetables and clothing, which have seasonal cost variations. INDEC has indicated that it based its evaluation of spending habits on a study of a national household consumption survey from 2004 to 2005 in addition to other sources; however, the new index has been criticized by economists and investors after its debut report found prices rising well below expectations. These events have affected the credibility of the consumer price 13 Table of Contents index published by INDEC, as well as other indexes published by INDEC which require the consumer price index for their own calculation, including the poverty index, the unemployment index and real gross domestic product. Argentinas inflation rate may be significantly higher than the rates indicated by official reports. In addition, if it is determined that it is necessary to correct the consumer price index and the other INDEC indexes derived from the consumer price index, there could be a significant decrease in confidence in the Argentine economy, which could, in turn, have a materially adverse effect on our ability to access international credit markets at market rates to finance our operations. Argentinas ability to obtain financing from international markets is limited which may affect its ability to implement reforms and foster economic growth. In the first half of 2005, Argentina restructured part of its sovereign debt that had been in default since the end of 2001. The Argentine government announced that as a result of the restructuring, it had approximately US$126.6 billion in total outstanding debt remaining. Of this amount, approximately US$19.5 billion are defaulted bonds owned by creditors who did not participate in the restructuring of the external financial debt. As of June 30, 2009, the total outstanding debt was approximately US$140.6 billion. Some bondholders in the United States, Italy and Germany have filed legal actions against Argentina, and holdout creditors may initiate new suits in the future. Additionally, foreign shareholders of certain Argentine companies have filed claims in excess of US$17 billion before the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, alleging that certain government measures are inconsistent with the fair and equitable treatment standards set forth in various bilateral treaties to which Argentina is a party. As of the date of this annual report, the ICSID has rendered decisions in eight cases, requiring the Argentine government to pay approximately US$ 1.0 billion plus interest in claims. In addition, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law rendered an award against the Argentine government and ordered it to pay US$240 million plus interest and court costs. A group of bondholders that had not taken part in the restructuring of the Argentine sovereign debt sought international arbitration before the ICSID for the sum of US$4.4 billion. Argentina has recently reinitiated discussions with holdout creditors and certain multilateral institutions. However, Argentinas past default and its failure to restructure completely its remaining sovereign debt and fully negotiate with the holdout creditors may prevent Argentina from reentering the international capital markets. Litigation initiated by holdout creditors as well as ICSID claims may result in material judgments against the Argentine government and could result in attachments of, or injunctions relating to, assets of Argentina that the government intended for other uses. As a result, the government may not have the financial resources necessary to implement reforms and foster growth which could have a material adverse effect on the countrys economy and, consequently, our business. In addition, the difficulties Argentina faces to access financing in the international markets could have an adverse effect on our capacity to obtain financing in the international markets in order to finance our operations and growth. Significant devaluation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect the Argentine economy as well as our financial performance. Despite the positive effects of the real depreciation of the Peso in 2002 on the competitiveness of certain sectors of the Argentine economy, it has also had a far-reaching negative impact on the Argentine economy and on businesses and individuals financial condition. The devaluation of the Peso has had a negative impact on the ability of Argentine businesses to honor their foreign currency-denominated debt, initially led to very high inflation, significantly reduced real wages, had a negative impact on businesses whose success is dependent on domestic market demand, such as utilities and the financial industry, and adversely affected the governments ability to honor its foreign debt obligations. If the Peso devalues significantly, all of the negative effects on the Argentine economy related to such devaluation could recur, with adverse consequences to our business. Moreover, it would likely result in a decline in the value of our common shares and the ADSs as measured in U.S. dollars. 14 Table of Contents Significant appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect the Argentine economy. A substantial increase in the value of the Peso against the U.S. dollar also presents risks for the Argentine economy. The appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar negatively impacts the financial condition of entities whose foreign currency-denominated assets exceed their foreign currency-denominated liabilities, such as us. In addition, in the short term, a significant real appreciation of the Peso would adversely affect exports. This could have a negative effect on GDP growth and employment as well as reduce the Argentine public sectors revenues by reducing tax collection in real terms, given its current heavy reliance on taxes on exports. The appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar could have an adverse effect on the Argentine economy and our business. Government measures to preempt or respond to social unrest may adversely affect the Argentine economy and our business. The Argentine government has historically exercised significant influence over the countrys economy. Additionally, the countrys legal and regulatory frameworks have at times suffered radical changes, due to political influence and significant uncertainties. Moreover, during its crisis in 2001 and 2002, Argentina experienced significant social and political turmoil, including civil unrest, riots, looting, nationwide protests, strikes and street demonstrations. Despite Argentinas economic recovery and relative stabilization, social and political tension and high levels of poverty and unemployment continue. In 2008, Argentina faced nationwide strikes and protests from farmers due to increased export taxes on agricultural products, which disrupted economic activity and have heightened political tension. Future government policies to preempt, or in response to, social unrest may include expropriation, nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, suspension of the enforcement of creditors rights, new taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and changes in laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment. Such policies could destabilize the country and adversely and materially affect the economy, and thereby our business. The nationalization of Argentinas pension funds has adversely affected local capital markets and may continue to do so. Under Law No. 26,425, which was published in the Official Gazette in December 2008, the Argentine government transferred the approximately Ps.94.4 billion (US$29.3 billion) in assets held by the countrys private Administradoras de Fondos de Jubilaciones y Pensiones (pension fund management companies, or AFJPs) to the government-run social security agency (ANSES). Law No. 26,425 was supplemented, among others, by Decree No. 2103/2008 which describes the composition of the fund to be managed by the Argentine Government and the directions for the management thereof; in turn, Decree No. 2104/08 regulates the matters concerning the transfer to the Argentine Government of the contributions and all the documentation of the members of the capitalization regime retroactive as of December 1, 2008. AFJPs were the largest participants in the countrys local capital market, leading the group of institutional investors. With the nationalization of their assets, the local capital market decreased in size and become substantially concentrated. In addition, the government became a significant shareholder in many of the countrys private companies, which will bring about consequences that are difficult to be measured as of to date. As a result, access to liquidity may be further limited, funding costs may rise and the government may have greater influence over the operations of private companies. The nationalization of the AFJPs has adversely affected investor confidence in Argentina. In addition, we cannot assure you that the government will not take similar measures in the future that interfere with private sector businesses and adversely affect the economy in general, and/or our business in particular. 15 Table of Contents Exchange controls and restrictions on transfers abroad and capital inflow restrictions have limited, and can be expected to continue to limit, the availability of international credit. In 2001 and 2002, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. Many of these restrictions were substantially eased after the crisis. However, in June 2005, the government issued decree No. 616/2005, that established additional controls on capital inflows, including the requirement that, subject to limit exemptions, 30% of funds remitted to Argentina remain deposited in a domestic financial institution for one year without earning any interest. This measure increases the cost of obtaining foreign funds and limits access to these funds. The Argentine government may impose additional controls on the foreign exchange market and on capital flows from and into Argentina, in the future, for example in response to capital flight or depreciation of the peso. These restrictions may have a negative effect on the economy and our business if imposed in an economic environment where access to local capital is substantially constrained. In December 2008 Law No. 26,476 introduced certain changes in the Argentine labor and tax regime. As part of these changes, a broad tax moratorium was declared and natural and legal persons falling under its scope were given the option to disclose their holdings in national and foreign currency and other assets, both in Argentina and abroad, for purposes of their entry to the country, subject to the payment of a tax as established in the law. Those falling under the scope of this law were not obliged to disclose to the Argentine Tax Authority (AFIP) the date of purchase of their holdings or the source of the funds with which they purchased them, and were released from any civil, commercial or criminal tax actions relating to those holdings. The period to disclose the holdings was effective from March 1, 2009 until August 31, 2009. Although the International Financial Action Group (GAFI) has not rendered an opinion in this regard, these actions could encourage the entry of money of doubtful origin, breaching the international regulations and commitments assumed by Argentina, which would in turn generate even more distrust in the local financial system. Finally, Resolution No. 82/2009, the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance suspended during the term of the tax mentioned tax moratorium until September 2009, the statutory deposit required for bringing capital into Argentina, when it was destinated for any of the uses described in Section 27 (b), (c) and (d) of Law No. 26,476. Therefore, no deposit would be required when bringing capital into Argentina, pursuant to the terms of the tax moratorium, for the following purposes: (i) assets based in the country and holdings of local and foreign currency in Argentina; (ii) foreign currency held abroad and/or foreign deposits, and local currency and/or foreign currency held in Argentina, allocated to the subscription of government securities issued by the Argentine government; (iii) foreign currency held abroad and/or foreign deposits, and local currency and/or foreign currency held in Argentina by individuals, allocated to the purchase in Argentina of newly built properties or properties that have obtained the relevant work completion certificate; and (iv) foreign currency held abroad and/or foreign deposits, and local currency and/or foreign currency held in Argentina, allocated to the building of new properties, completion of works in progress, funding of infrastructure works, real estate, agricultural, industrial, tourism and services investments in Argentina. Payment of dividends to non-residents has been limited in the past and may be limited again. Beginning in February 2002, the payment of dividends, irrespective of amount, outside Argentina required prior authorization from the Central Bank. On January 7, 2003, the Central Bank issued communication A 3859, which is still in force and pursuant to which there are no limitations on companies ability to purchase foreign currency and transfer it outside Argentina to pay dividends, provided that those dividends arise from approved and audited financial statements. However similar restrictions may be enacted by the Argentine government or the Central Bank again and, if this were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on the value of our common shares and the ADSs. Moreover, in such event, restrictions on the transfers of funds abroad may impede your ability to receive dividend payments as a holder of ADSs. The stability of the Argentine banking system is uncertain. During 2001 and the first half of 2002, a significant amount of deposits were withdrawn from Argentine financial institutions. This massive withdrawal of deposits was largely due to the loss of confidence of depositors in the Argentine governments ability to repay its debts, including its debts within the financial system, and to maintain peso-dollar parity in the context of its solvency crisis. 16 Table of Contents To prevent a run on the U.S. dollar reserves of local banks, the government restricted the amount of money that account holders could withdraw from banks and introduced exchange controls restricting capital outflows. While the condition of the financial system has improved, adverse economic developments, even if not related to or attributable to the financial system, could result in deposits flowing out of the banks and into the foreign exchange market, as depositors seek to shield their financial assets from a new crisis. Any run on deposits could create liquidity or even solvency problems for financial institutions, resulting in a contraction of available credit. In the event of a future shock, such as the failure of one or more banks or a crisis in depositor confidence, the Argentine government could impose further exchange controls or transfer restrictions and take other measures that could lead to renewed political and social tensions and undermine the Argentine governments public finances, which could adversely affect Argentinas economy and prospects for economic growth. The Argentine economy could be adversely affected by economic developments in other global markets, in particular if the global financial and economic recovery is interrupted. Financial and securities markets in Argentina are influenced, to varying degrees, by economic and market conditions in other global markets. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors perception of the events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into other countries, including Argentina and the availability of funds for issuers in such countries. Lower capital inflows and declining securities prices negatively affect the real economy of a country through higher interest rates or currency volatility. The Argentine economy was adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred in several emerging economies in the 1990s, including Mexico in 1994, the collapse of several Asian economies between 1997 and 1998, the economic crisis in Russia in 1998 and the Brazilian devaluation in January 1999. In addition, Argentina is also affected by the economic conditions of major trade partners, such as Brazil, or countries such as the United States, that are significant trade partners and/or have influence over world economic cycles. If interest rates rise significantly in developed economies, including the United States, Argentina and other emerging market economies could find it more difficult and expensive to borrow capital and refinance existing debt, which would negatively affect their economic growth. In addition, if these countries, which are also Argentinas trade partners, fall into a recession the Argentine economy would be impacted by decrease in exports. All of these factors would have a negative impact on us, our business, operations, financial condition and prospects. In 2008, the global financial system experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption. As a result, the financial turmoil led to a significant tightening of credit, low levels of liquidity, extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets and capital outflows away from emerging markets, including Argentina. This financial crisis has also produced an adverse impact on global economic conditions. Countries around the world experienced a significant deterioration in economic conditions, including the United States. However, in recent months, worldwide markets have experienced some sings of recovery. This reversal may have a negative impact on the Argentine economy, and could adversely affect the conditions in the country in the future. If the decline in international prices for Argentinas main commodity exports continues it could have an adverse effect on Argentinas economic growth and on our business. Argentinas economy has historically relied on the export of commodities, the prices of which have been volatile in the past and largely outside its control. Argentinas recovery from the crisis at 2001 and 2002 has depended to a significant extent on the rise in commodity prices, particularly prices of its main commodity 17 Table of Contents exports, such as soybean. High commodity prices have contributed significantly to government revenues from taxes on exports. In recent months, the prices of the commodities that Argentina exports have decline significantly. If commodity prices continue to decline, the growth of the Argentine economy could be adversely affected. Such occurrence would have a negative impact on the levels of government revenues, the governments ability to service its debt and on our business. Restrictions on the supply of energy could negatively affect Argentinas economy. As a result of several years of recession, and the forced conversion into Pesos and subsequent freeze of gas and electricity tariffs, there has been a lack of investment in gas and electricity supply and transport capacity in Argentina in recent years. At the same time, demand for natural gas and electricity has increased substantially, driven by a recovery in economic conditions and price constraints. The federal government has been taking a number of measures to alleviate the short-term impact of energy shortages on residential and industrial users. If these measures prove to be insufficient, or if the investment that is required to increase natural gas production and transportation capacity and energy generation and transportation capacity over the medium-and long-term fails to materialize on a timely basis, economic activity in Argentina could be curtailed. Risks Related to Our Business We are subject to risks inherent to the operation of shopping centers that may affect our profitability. Shopping centers are subject to various factors that affect their development, administration and profitability. These factors include:  the accessibility and the attractiveness of the area where the shopping center is located;  the intrinsic attractiveness of the shopping center;  the flow of people and the level of sales of each shopping center rental unit;  increasing competition from internet sales;  the amount of rent collected from each shopping center rental unit; and  the fluctuations in occupancy levels in the shopping centers. An increase in operating costs, caused by inflation or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on us if our tenants are unable to pay higher rent due to the increase in expenses. Moreover, the shopping center business is closely related to consumer spending and to the economy in which customers are located. All of our shopping centers are in Argentina, and, as a consequence, their business could be seriously affected by potential recession in Argentina. For example, during the economic crisis in Argentina, spending decreased significantly, unemployment, political instability and inflation significantly reduced consumer spending in Argentina, lowering tenants sales and forcing some tenants to leave our shopping centers. If the international financial crisis has a substantial impact on economic activity in Argentina, it will likely have a material adverse effect on the revenues from the shopping center activity. 18 Table of Contents Our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments. Our real estate investments are subject to risks common to commercial and residential properties in general, many of which are not within our control. Any of these risks may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the level of sales or rental income generated and expenses incurred. Our ability to generate sufficient income from our properties and to service our debt and cover other expenses may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others, some of which we cannot control:  downturns in the national, regional and local economic climate;  changes in interest rates and availability of financing;  civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;  changes in our ability or our tenants ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance, possibly decreasing the useful life of and revenue from property;  law reforms and governmental regulations (such as those governing usage, zoning and real property taxes);  oversupply of retail space or a reduction in demand for retail space, which could result in lower rent prices and lower revenues for us;  increased competition from other real estate operators which might drive down our prices and profits;  increases in operating expenses which could lower our profitability;  the inability to collect rents due to bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise;  the need to periodically renovate, repair and release space, the higher costs thereof;  exercise by our tenants of their legal right to terminate their leases early; and  the inability to find new tenants as leases on our properties expire or terminate early. An economic downturn in the areas in which the shopping centers are located, bankruptcy of tenants and reduction in the shopping center sales due to lower disposable income might materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors such as insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security and cleaning costs, may result in the inability or unwillingness of some tenants to pay rent or increase expense. An adverse economic environment for real estate companies and credit crisis may adversely impact our results of operations and business prospects significantly. The success of our business and profitability of our operations are dependent on continued investment in the real estate markets and access to capital and debt financing. A long term crisis of confidence in real estate investments and lack of available credit for acquisitions would be likely to constrain our business growth. As part of our business goals, we intend to increase our properties portfolio with strategic acquisitions of core properties at advantageous prices, and core plus and value added properties where we believe we can bring necessary expertise to enhance property values. In order to pursue acquisitions, we need access to equity capital and also debt financing. Current disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy and restructuring of major financial institutions, may adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt and the 19 Table of Contents availability and cost of credit in the near future. Any consideration of sales of existing properties or portfolio interests may be tempered by current decreasing property values. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness depends on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions. If a recurrence of the disruptions in financial markets presents itself in the future, there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore investor confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit. The loss of significant tenants could adversely affect both the operating revenues and value of our properties We have a number of important tenants occupying space in more than one shopping center. A decision by an anchor tenant or other significant tenant to cease operations at one or more of our properties could have a material adverse effect on those properties and, by extension, on our financial condition and results of operations. The closing of an anchor or other significant tenant may allow other tenants at an affected property to terminate their leases, to seek rent relief and/or cease operating their stores or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the property. In addition, key tenants at one or more properties might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry. The bankruptcy and/or closure of one or more significant tenants, if we are not able to successfully re-lease the affected space, could have a material adverse effect on both the operating revenues and underlying value of the properties involved. Our future acquisitions may be unprofitable. We intend to acquire additional shopping center properties to the extent that they will be acquired on advantageous terms and meet our investment criteria. Acquisitions of commercial properties entail general investment risks associated with any real estate investment, including:  our estimates of the cost of improvements needed to bring the property up to established standards for the market may prove to be inaccurate;  properties we acquire may fail to achieve within the time frames we project the occupancy or rental rates we project at the time we make the decision to acquire, which may result in the properties failure to achieve the returns we projected;  our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs; and  our investigation of a property or building prior to its acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost. If we acquire a business, we will be required to integrate the operations, personnel and accounting and information systems of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions of or investments in companies may cause disruptions in our operations and divert managements attention away from day-to-day operations, which could impair our relationships with our current tenants and employees. We face risks associated with property acquisitions. We have acquired in the past, and intend to acquire in the future, properties, including large properties (such as the acquisition of Abasto de Buenos Aires or Alto Palermo Shopping) that would increase our size and potentially alter our capital structure. Although we believe that the acquisitions that we have completed in the past and that we expect to undertake in the future, have, and will, enhance our future financial performance, the success of such transactions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the risk that:  we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms; 20 Table of Contents  acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;  the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than we estimate;  acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy, absence of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and  we may not be able to efficiently integrate acquired properties, particularly portfolios of properties, into our organization and to manage new properties in a way that allows us to realize cost savings and synergies. Our development activities depend on our ability to obtain and maintain zoning, environmental, land-use and other governmental approvals. We own parcels of land which are not currently zoned for the type of development we propose. In addition, we do not yet have the required building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations that we will need to be able to develop these properties as we currently propose. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our attempts to rezone such land and to obtain all necessary permits and authorizations, or that rezoning efforts and permit requests will not be unreasonably delayed. Moreover, we may be affected by building moratoria and anti-growth legislation, particularly in the City of Buenos Aires. If we are unable to obtain all of the governmental permits and authorizations we need to develop our present and future projects, we may be forced to make unplanned or unbudgeted modifications to such projects or abandon them altogether, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital. Our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition and development of additional properties. As a result, we are likely to depend to an important degree on the availability of debt or equity capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We cannot guarantee that additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. Our access to debt or equity capital markets depends on a number of factors, including the markets perception of our growth potential, our ability to pay dividends, our financial condition, our credit rating and our current and potential future earnings. Depending on the outcome of these factors, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy. Argentine lease laws impose restrictions that limit our flexibility. Argentine laws governing leases impose certain restrictions, including the following:  lease agreements may not contain inflation adjustment clauses based on consumer price indexes or wholesale price indexes, and as a result we face the risk of higher inflation. Although many of our lease agreements contain readjustment clauses, these are not based on an official index nor do they reflect the inflation index. In the event of litigation, there can be no assurance that we may be able to enforce such clauses contained in our lease agreements;  lease agreements must be for a minimum term of two years for residential properties and three years for retail property, except in the case of stands and/or spaces for special exhibitions;  lease terms may not exceed ten years; and 21 Table of Contents  tenants may rescind commercial lease agreements after the initial six months. The exercise of such rescission rights by our tenants could materially and adversely affect our business and we cannot assure you that our tenants will not exercise such right, especially if rent values stabilize or decline in the future. In addition, new Argentine laws and regulations may impose limits on lease prices and, in such case, they would likely have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. Eviction proceedings in Argentina are difficult and time consuming. Although Argentine law permits a summary proceeding to collect unpaid rent and a special proceeding to evict tenants, eviction proceedings in Argentina are difficult and time-consuming. Historically, the heavy workload of the courts and the numerous procedural steps required have generally delayed landlords efforts to evict tenants. Eviction proceedings generally take between six months and two years from the date of filing of the suit to the time of actual eviction. Historically, delinquency regarding our office rental space has been low, and we have usually attempted to negotiate the termination of lease agreements with defaulting tenants after the first few months of non-payment in order to avoid legal proceedings. Delinquency may increase significantly in the future, and such negotiations with tenants may not be as successful as they have been in the past. Moreover, new Argentine laws and regulations may forbid or restrict eviction proceedings or impose limits on lease prices, and in each such case they would likely have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. Our development, redevelopment and construction activities are inherently risky and may render projects unprofitable for us. In the development, renovation and construction of shopping centers and residential apartment complexes, we generally hire third-party contractors. Risks associated with our development, renovation and construction activities include:  significant time lag between commencement and completion subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuation in the general economy;  abandonment of development opportunities and renovation proposals;  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates, making a project unprofitable;  occupancy rates and rents of a newly completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable;  sale prices for residential units may be insufficient to cover development costs;  we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms for the development of a project;  pre-construction buyers may default on their purchase contracts, or units in new buildings may remain unsold upon completion of construction;  construction and lease-up may not be completed on schedule because of a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals, or man-made or natural disasters (such as fires, hurricanes, earthquakes or floods), resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs;  we may be unable to obtain or may face delays in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations; and  we may incur in capital expenditures that could result in considerable time consuming efforts and which may never be completed due to government restrictions; contractors claims for the enforcement 22 Table of Contents of labor laws in Argentina (sections 30, 31, 32 under Law No. 20,744), which provide for joint and several liability. Many companies in Argentina hire personnel from third-party companies that provide outsourced services. Due to such need they signed indemnity agreements in the event of labor claims from employees of such third company that may affect the liability of such hiring company. However, in the last years there have been several courts which denied the existence of independence in those labors relationships and ruled in favor of a plaintiff (employee) by means of declaring the existence of joint and several liabilities between both companies. While our policies with respect to expansion, renovation and development activities are intended to limit some of the risks otherwise associated with such activities, we are nevertheless subject to risks associated with the construction of properties, such as cost overruns, design changes and timing delays arising from a lack of availability of materials and labor, weather conditions and other factors outside of our control, as well as financing costs, may exceed original estimates, possibly making the associated investment unprofitable. Any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these redevelopment projects and harm our operating results. We are subject to great competitive pressure. All of our properties are located in Argentina. There are other shopping centers and numerous smaller retail stores and residential properties within the market area of each of our properties. The number of competing properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease retail space in our shopping centers or sell units in our residential complexes and on the amount of rent or the sale price that we are able to charge. To date, there have been relatively few companies competing with us for shopping center properties. However, if additional companies become active in the Argentine shopping center market in the future, such competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our assets are highly concentrated in certain geographic areas and an economic downturn in such areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, 81.9% of our sales from leases and services were derived from properties in the City of Buenos Aires and the greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. Although we own properties and may acquire or develop additional properties outside of the City of Buenos Aires and the greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area, we expect to continue to depend to a very large extent on economic conditions affecting those areas and therefore, an economic downturn in those areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our dependence on rental income may adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations. The substantial majority of our income is derived from rental income from real property. As a result, our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. Our income and funds for distribution would be negatively affected if a significant number of our tenants, or any of our major tenants (as discussed in more detail below):  Delay lease commencements;  Decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration;  Fail to make rental payments when due; or  Close stores or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. In addition, we cannot be sure that any tenant whose lease expires will renew that lease or that we will be able to re-lease space on economically advantageous terms. The loss of rental revenues from a number of our tenants and our inability to replace such tenants may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to meet debt and other financial obligations. 23 Table of Contents Some potential losses are not covered by insurance and/or certain kinds of insurance coverage may become prohibitively expensive. We currently carry liability insurance for operations, liability insurance for Directors and Officers, against any risk of material damages and/or losses, including, and rental loss insurance on all of our properties. Although we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are generally customary, there are certain types of losses, such as terrorism and acts of war that generally are not insured under the insurance policies offered in the national market. Should a loss occur as a result of the occurrence of any of the referred events, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage in an adequate amount or at reasonable prices. Insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold, or, if offered, these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive. Moreover, we do not purchase life or disability insurance for any of our key employees. If any of our key employees were to die or become incapacitated, we could experience losses caused by a disruption in our operations which will not be covered by insurance, and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. If any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Our level of debt may adversely affect our operations and our ability to pay our debt as it becomes due. We had, and expect to continue to have, substantial liquidity and capital resource requirements to finance our business. As of June 30, 2009, our consolidated financial debt amounted to Ps.928.0 million (including accrued and unpaid interests and deferred financing costs). Although we are generating sufficient funds from operating cash flows to satisfy our debt service requirements and our capacity to obtain new financing is adequate given the current availability of the credit lines with the Banks . We cannot assure you that we will maintain such cash flow and adequate financial capacity in the future. The fact that we are leveraged may affect our ability to refinance existing debt or borrow additional funds to finance working capital, acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, the recurrent disruptions in the global financial markets, including the bankruptcy and restructuring of major financial institutions, may adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt and the availability and cost of credit in the future. In such conditions, access to capital and debt financing options may be restricted and it may be uncertain how long these economic circumstances may last. This would require us to allocate a substantial portion of cash flow to repay principal and interest, thereby reducing the amount of money available to invest in operations, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our leverage could also affect our competitiveness and limit our ability to react to market conditions, the real estate industry and economic downturns. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt service requirements or to obtain future financing. If we cannot satisfy our debt service requirements or if we default on any financial or other covenants in our debt arrangements, the holders of our debt will be able to accelerate the maturity of such debt or cause defaults under the other debt arrangements. Our ability to service debt obligations or to refinance them will depend upon our future financial and operating performance, which will, in part, be subject to factors beyond our control such as macroeconomic conditions (including the recent international credit crisis) and regulatory changes in Argentina. If we cannot obtain future financing, we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our planned capital expenditures, which could adversely affect our ability to generate cash flows and repay our obligations. 24 Table of Contents We may be negatively affected by a financial crisis in the U.S. and global capital markets. We must maintain liquidity to fund our working capital, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue new business opportunities. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption during the last couple of years. If our current resources do not satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of the prospects of our company or the industry generally. We cannot assure that we will successfully obtain any necessary additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The recurrence of a credit crisis could have a negative impact on our major customers who in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. The recent credit crisis had a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. Although we believe that our cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under the current conditions, will provide us with sufficient liquidity, the impact of a crisis on our major customers cannot be predicted and may be quite severe. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in the demand for leaseable spaces and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. The shift of consumers to purchasing goods over the Internet may negatively affect sales in our shopping centers. During the last years, retail sales by means of the Internet have grown significantly in Argentina, even though the market share of Internet sales related to retail sales is still not significant. The Internet enables manufacturers and retailers to sell directly to consumers, diminishing the importance of traditional distribution channels such as retail stores and shopping centers. We believe that our target consumers are increasingly using the Internet, from home, work or elsewhere, to shop electronically for retail goods, and this trend is likely to continue. If e-commerce and retail sales through the Internet continue to grow, consumers reliance on traditional distribution channels such as our shopping centers could be materially diminished, having a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. We are subject to payment default risks due to our investments in credit card activities and personal loans through our subsidiary Tarshop. As of June 30, 2009, we own a 93.4% interest in Tarshop, a company dedicated to the Consumer financing business that originates credit cards accounts and personal loans to promote sales from our tenants and other selected retailers. In addition, Tarshop owns 50% of Metroshop S.A.s (Metroshop) stock capital. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, Tarshop had net revenues of Ps236.8 million, representing 36.9% of our consolidated revenues for such period and incurred a net loss of Ps94.1 million. The Consumer financing segment, in which Tarshop and its businesses take part may be adversely affected by defaults on credit card accounts and personal loans, defaults by card holders, difficulties enforcing collection of payments in court, fraudulent accounts and the writing off of past due receivables. Tarshop provides an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on impaired accounts, historical charge-off patterns and management judgment. Due to the current credit crisis and other conditions, some customers experienced delays in payments and delinquency rates increased during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Tarshop has increased the level of the allowance for doubtful accounts which amounts to Ps.79.1 million as of June 30, 2009. Tarshop is closely monitoring the delays, delinquency and uncollectibility rates. 25 Table of Contents The present rates of delinquency, collection proceedings and loss of receivables may vary and be affected by numerous factors beyond our control, which, among others, include:  adverse changes in the Argentine economy;  adverse changes in the regional economies;  political instability;  changes in regulations;  increases in unemployment; and  erosion of real and/or nominal salaries. The factors described above and other factors may have an adverse effect on rates of delinquency, collections and receivables, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of Tarshops credit card and personal loan business. In addition, if our consumer financing business is adversely affected by any of the above factors, the quality of its securitized receivables is also likely to be adversely affected. Therefore, we could be adversely affected to the extent that we hold an interest in any such securitized receivables. Tarshops accounts receivables, which consist of cash flows from consumer financing and personal loans, are placed into a number of trust accounts that securitize those receivables. Tarshop sells beneficial interests in these trust accounts through the sale of debt certificates, but remains a beneficiary of these trust accounts by holding Ps.147.0 million in equity certificates as of June 30, 2009. The securitization market is still open and Tarshop completed securitization programs during the recent months with no disruptions. As of June 30, 2009, Tarshop credit risk exposure is contractually limited to the subordinated retained interests representing Ps.147.0 million and Ps.7.8 million escrow reserves for losses. Due to the factors mentioned above, as of June 30, 2009, Tarshop recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of Ps.12.1 million to the retained interests to reflect current fair value. We cannot assure you that collection of payments from credit card accounts and personal loans will be sufficient to distribute earnings to holders of participation certificates, which would reduce Tarshops earnings. In addition, local authorities might increase credit card or trust account regulations, negatively affecting Tarshops revenues and results of operation. We may also face higher liquidity risks on financial trusts. Our subordinated interest in Tarshops securitized assets may have no value. Through our subsidiary Tarshop, we participate in the consumer financing business. Tarshop operates in the issuance, processing and marketing of our own non-banking credit card called Tarjeta Shopping and grants personal loans. Tarshops accounts receivables which consist of cash flows from consumer financing and personal loans are placed into a number of financial trusts that securitize those receivables. These financial trusts issue trust debt securities which are placed through public offering, while Tarshop keeps a subordinated interest by holding participation certificates. Such participation certificates amounted to Ps.147.0 million as of June 30, 2009. The trust debt securities accrue variable interest rates, subject to floors and caps. As a result, the value of subordinated interests in Tarshop Financial Trust and Metroshop could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates. We cannot assure you that collection of payments from credit card accounts and personal loans will be sufficient to recover the participation certificates, which would reduce Tarshops earnings. In addition, local authorities might increase credit card or trust account regulations, negatively affecting Tarshops revenues and results of operation. 26 Table of Contents An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policies on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties. Under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties, tenants are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from our negligence or intentional misconduct or that of our agents. Tenants are generally required, at the tenants expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. In addition, we cannot assure the holders that the tenants will properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles. Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our business is subject to extensive regulation and additional regulations may be imposed in the future. Our activities are subject to federal, state and municipal laws, and to regulations, authorizations and licenses required with respect to construction, zoning, use of the soil, environmental protection and historical patrimony, consumer protection, antitrust and other requirements, all of which affect our ability to acquire land, develop and build projects and negotiate with customers. In addition, companies in this industry are subject to increasing tax rates, the creation of new taxes and changes in the taxation regime. We are required to obtain licenses and authorizations with different governmental authorities in order to carry out our projects. Maintaining our licenses and authorizations can be a costly provision. In the case of non-compliance with such laws, regulations, licenses and authorizations, we may face fines, project shutdowns, cancellation of licenses, and revocation of authorizations. In addition, public authorities may issue new and stricter standards, or enforce or interpret existing laws and regulations in a more restrictive manner, which may force us to make expenditures to comply with such new rules. Development activities are also subject to risks relating to potential delays or an inability to obtain all necessary zoning, environmental, land-use, development, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. Any such delays or failures to obtain such government approvals may have an adverse effect on our business. In the past, the Argentine government imposed strict and burdensome regulations regarding leases in response to housing shortages, high rates of inflation and difficulties in accessing credit. Such regulations limited or prohibited increases on rental prices and prohibited eviction of tenants, even for failure to pay rent. Most of our leases provide that the tenants pay all costs and taxes related to their respective leased areas. In the event of a significant increase in the amount of such costs and taxes, the Argentine government may respond to political pressure to intervene by regulating this practice, thereby negatively affecting our rental income. We cannot assure you that the Argentine government will not impose similar or other regulations in the future. Changes in existing laws or the enactment of new laws governing the ownership, operation or leasing of properties in Argentina could negatively affect the Argentine real estate market and the rental market and materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by law. In accordance with Argentine corporate law, we may pay dividends in Pesos out of retained earnings, if any, to the extent set forth in our audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Argentine GAAP. Dividend restrictions in our subsidiaries debt agreements may adversely affect us. We have subsidiaries and hence an important source of funds for us is cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries. The debt agreements of our subsidiaries may contain covenants restricting their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions. If our subsidiaries are unable to make payments to our Company, or are able to pay only limited amounts, we may be unable to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness. 27 Table of Contents We are controlled by two principal shareholders. As of November 30, 2009, IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima (IRSA) and Parque Arauco S.A. (Parque Arauco), our major shareholders, owned in the aggregate 92.9% of our capital stock. These principal shareholders control us and have significant influence on the election of our directors and the outcome of any action requiring shareholder approval. The number of shares beneficially owned by IRSA and Parque Arauco in the aggregate will increase by approximately 2,183,647,244 assuming full conversion of US$47.2 million of our outstanding Convertible Notes owned by IRSA and Parque Arauco. We are dependent on our chairman, Eduardo S. Elsztain and certain other senior managers. Our success, to a significant extent, on the continued employment of Eduardo S. Elsztain, Chairman of our board of directors, who has significant expertise and knowledge of our business and industry. The loss or interruption in of his services for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success also depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel, or that any of our personnel will remain employed by our Company. Due to the currency mismatches between our assets and liabilities, we have significant currency exposure. As of June 30, 2009, the majority of our liabilities, such as our Series I Notes and our convertible notes are denominated in U.S. dollars while our revenues and most of our assets as of June 30, 2009 are denominated in Pesos. This currency gap exposes us to a risk of exchange rate volatility, which would negatively affect our financial results if the dollar were to appreciate against the Peso. Any further depreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar will correspondingly increase the amount of our debt in Pesos, with further adverse effects on our results of operation and financial condition and may increase the collection risk of our leases and other receivables from our tenants and mortgage debtors, most of whom have Peso-denominated revenues. Risks Related to the American Shares and the Shares Shares eligible for sale could adversely affect the price of our shares and American Depositary Shares (ADS) The market prices of our common shares and ADS could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders of common shares or ADS in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. The ADS are freely transferable under U.S. securities laws, including shares sold to our affiliates. IRSA and Parque Arauco, which as of November 30, 2009 own approximately 92.9% of our common shares (or approximately 726,527,059 common shares which may be exchanged for an aggregate of 18,163,176 ADS), are free to dispose of any or all of their common shares or ADS at any time in their discretion. Sales of a large number of our common shares and/or ADS would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and the ADS. We are subject to certain different corporate disclosure requirements and accounting standards than domestic issuers of listed securities in the United States There may be less publicly available information about the issuers of securities listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange (Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires) than is regularly published by or about domestic issuers of listed securities in the United States and certain other countries. In addition, all listed Argentine companies must prepare their financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Argentina which differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. Consequently, the presentation of Argentine financial statements and reported earnings may differ from that of companies in other countries in this and other respects. 28 Table of Contents We are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Investors may not be able to effect service of process within the U.S., limiting their recovery of any foreign judgment We are a publicly held stock corporation (sociedad anónima) organized under the laws of Argentina. Most of our directors and senior managers, and most of our assets are located in Argentina. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such persons or to enforce against them in United States courts judgments obtained in such courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws. There is doubt whether the Argentine courts will enforce in all respects, to the same extent and in as timely a manner as a U.S. or foreign court, an action predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws or other foreign regulations brought against such persons or against us. If we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of our securities would suffer negative consequences Based on the current and projected composition of our income and valuation of our assets we do not believe we were a passive foreign investment company (PFIC), for United States federal income tax purposes for the tax year ending June 30, 2009, and we do not currently expect to become a PFIC, although there can be no assurance in this regard. The determination of whether we are a PFIC is made annually. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be a PFIC in the current or any future taxable year due to changes in our asset or income composition or if our projections are not accurate. The volatility and instability of Argentinas economic and financial system may substantially affect the composition of our income and assets and the accuracy of our projections. In addition, this determination is based on the interpretation of certain U.S. Treasury regulations relating to rental income, which regulations are potentially subject to differing interpretation. If we become a PFIC, U.S. Holders (as defined in Taxation-United States Taxation) of our shares or ADS will be subject to certain United States federal income tax rules that have negative consequences for U.S. Holders such as additional tax and an interest charge upon certain distributions by us or upon a sale or other disposition of our shares or ADSs at a gain, as well as reporting requirements. Please see Taxation-United States Taxation for a more detailed discussion of the consequences if we are deemed a PFIC. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to your particular circumstances. Under Argentine law, shareholder rights may be fewer or less well defined than in other jurisdictions. Our corporate affairs are governed by our by-laws and by Argentine corporate law, which differ from the legal principles that would apply if we were incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, such as the States of Delaware or New York, or in other jurisdictions outside Argentina. In addition, your rights or the rights of holders of our common shares to protect your or their interests in connection with actions by our board of directors may be fewer and less well defined under Argentine corporate law than under the laws of those other jurisdictions. Although insider trading and price manipulation are illegal under Argentine law, the Argentine securities markets are not as highly regulated or supervised as the US securities markets or markets in some other jurisdictions. In addition, rules and policies against self-dealing and regarding the preservation of shareholder interests may be less well defined and enforced in Argentina than in the United States, putting holders of our common shares and ADSs at a potential disadvantage. 29 Table of Contents The protections afforded to minority shareholders in Argentina are different from and more limited than those in the United States and may be more difficult to enforce. Under Argentine law, the protections afforded to minority shareholders are different from, and much more limited than, those in the United States and some other Latin American countries. For example, the legal framework with respect to shareholder disputes, such as derivative lawsuits and class actions, is less developed under Argentine law than under U.S. law as a result of Argentinas short history with these types of claims and few successful cases. In addition, there are different procedural requirements for bringing these types of shareholder lawsuits. As a result, it may be more difficult for our minority shareholders to enforce their rights against us or our directors or controlling shareholder than it would be for shareholders of a US company. Holders of common shares may determine not to pay any dividends. In accordance with Argentine corporate law we may pay dividends to shareholders out of net and realized profits, if any, as set forth in our audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Argentine GAAP. The approval, amount and payment of dividends are subject to the approval by our shareholders at our annual ordinary shareholders meeting. The approval of dividends requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate enough net and realized profits so as to pay dividends or that our shareholders will decide that dividends will be paid.
