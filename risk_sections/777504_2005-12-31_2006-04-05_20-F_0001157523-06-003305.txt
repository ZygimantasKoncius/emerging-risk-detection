See Note 1 and the Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in Note 3533 to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of this Form 20-F. (2) As described in Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements, all U.S. GAAP earnings per share amounts have been restated to retroactively reflect the effects of a 5:1 share split, combined with a redemption procedure, in 2005. Through this procedure the shareholders received four new shares and a redemption share that was mandatorily redeemed for SEK 25. 9 Cash Dividends per Share The following table sets forth the total cash dividends per share with respect to each fiscal year. Because dividends are paid by the Group in Swedish kronor, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the U.S. dollar amounts received by holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Cash dividends are translated into U.S. dollars at the Noon Buying Rate on December 30, 2005.

(2) SKF has issued American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”). Each ADS represents one B Share. American Depositary Receipts (the “ADRs”) evidencing the ownership of the ADSs have been listed on the OTC Market. (3) Figures have been restated due to split and redemption in 2005 (4) Dividend according to Board of Directors' proposed distribution of surplus for the year. The dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting April 25, 2006, and has not been included as a liability in the financial statements. (5) The total transfer to the shareholders amounted to MSEK 4,212 whereof MSEK 2,846 pertained to the redemption and MSEK 1,366 to paid dividends. 10 Exchange Rates The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the Noon Buying Rate for Swedish krona in terms of Swedish kronor per U.S. dollar for the periods shown: Period Period End Average (1 ) High Low 2001 10.4571 10.4328 11.0270 9.3250 2002 8.6950 9.6571 10.7290 8.6950 2003 7.1950 8.0351 8.7920 7.1950 2004 6.6687 7.3320 7.7725 6.5939 2005 7.9370 7.5170 8.2434 6.6855 October 2005 7.9695 7.6870 November 2005 8.2434 7.9749 December 2005 8.1162 6.6855 January 2006 7.8097 7.5385 February 2003 7.9656 7.6487 (1) Calculated by using the average of the Noon Buying Rates on the last day of each full month during the period.

CAPITALIZATION AND INDEBTEDNESS Not applicable. 3.C. REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND USE OF PROCEEDS Not applicable. 3.D. RISK FACTORS Risks and uncertainties in the business The company operates in many different industrial and geographical segments that are at different stages of the economic cycles. A general economic downturn at the global level, or in one of the world’s leading economies, could reduce the demand for the Group's products, solutions and services for a period of time. The Group's wide geographical presence and its very broad customer base would normally mean that at any specific point in time the business climate is good in some of the geographical regions and some of the customer segments. Global political environment Terrorism and other hostilities as well as disturbances in worldwide financial markets could have a negative effect on the demand for the Group’s products, solutions and services. Competition In terms of sales, SKF is the world leader for bearings and the largest supplier to the European markets. In Western Europe, SKF is closely followed by the German Schaeffler Group, with its INA and FAG brands. SKF is number two in North America, with the US company, Timken (including Torrington) as the largest supplier there. SKF is the number-one supplier in the Asian markets outside Japan. The Japanese bearing market is dominated by the domestic manufacturers NSK Ltd, NTN Corp. and Koyo Seiko (renamed JTEKT following its merger with Toyoda Machine Works as of 1 January 2006). The largest, and also the fastest growing of the emerging markets, is China. It is a very fragmented market with many local manufacturers. SKF is currently one of the leading bearing companies in China - both as an importer and a local manufacturer - but in recent years all the major international bearing companies have set up production in the country. China is expected to show significant growth over the next few years both as a market and as a global supply base. The Central and Eastern European markets, where SKF is the leading bearing company in the region, are also characterized by a large number of local manufacturers serving more than 50% of the market. Their total size, however, accounts for only a few percentage points of the world market. The rolling bearing world can also be divided up according to the different types of bearings. Ball bearings, of various designs, account for more than half the market, while different roller bearings make up the balance. The most popular of the ball bearing types is the deep groove ball bearing, which accounts for about one third of the total world bearing market. Other ball bearings are angular contact ball bearings, self-aligning ball bearings, thrust ball bearings and hub bearing units for automotive wheels. The roller bearings are named according to the shape of the rollers. They can be cylindrical, spherical, tapered, or needle shaped. The largest of the roller bearing families is the tapered roller bearing, with a share of less than one fifth of the total world bearing market. Sales of this type of bearing have declined over the last 15 years, however, as wheel hub units incorporating balls now replace tapered roller bearings to a large extent. 12 Competitive factors, including changes in market penetration, increased price competition, the introduction of new products and technology by existing and new competitors as well as changes in customer demand on sales, product mix and prices could have a material adverse effect on SKF’s business and results of operations. Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group is exposed to changes in exchange rates in the future flows of payments related to firm commitments and forecasted transactions and to loans and investments in foreign currency, i.e. transaction exposure. The Group’s accounts are also affected by the effect of translating the results and net assets of foreign subsidiaries to SEK, i.e. translation exposure. A sensitivity analysis based on year-end figures and on the assumption that everything else is equal shows that a weakening of 10% of the SEK against the USD has an effect from net currency flows on profit before taxes of approximately MSEK 450, excluding any effects from hedging transactions. The Group’s exposure is primarily to the USD. Transaction exposure Transaction exposure mainly arises when manufacturing SKF companies sell their products to SKF companies situated in other countries to be sold to end-customers on that local market. Sales to end-customers are normally made in local currency. The Group’s principal commercial flows of foreign currencies pertain to exports from Europe to North America and Asia and to flows of currencies within Europe. Currency rates and payment conditions to be applied for the internal trade between SKF companies are set by SKF Treasury Centre. Internal invoicing during a quarter is made at fixed forward rates based on external market rates. Currency exposure and risk is primarily and to a large extent reduced by netting internal transactions. In some countries transaction exposure may arise from sales to external customers in a currency different from local currency. The Group’s main transaction exposure in 2005 was reduced through netting to MSEK 5,400. Translation exposure Translation exposure is defined as the Group’s exposure to currency risk arising when translating the results and net assets of foreign subsidiaries to Swedish kronor. In accordance with Group policy, these translation effects on the Group’s accounts are not hedged. 13 Interest rate risk exposure Liquidity and borrowing is concentrated to SKF Treasury Centre. By matching investments made by subsidiaries with borrowings of other subsidiaries, the interest rate exposure of the Group can be reduced. The exposure to currency and interest rate risk in foreign borrowing has been managed by cross-currency interest rate swaps. EUR loans with fixed and floating interest rates have been swapped into SEK loans with floating 3 months’ interest rates. As of December 31, 2005, the hedged loans amounted to MEUR 350. The floating 3 months’ STIBOR rate was 1.965%. The SKF Group policy states that the average interest period for investments must not exceed 12 months. As of December 31, 2005, the average interest period of the Group’s investments was 2 months and for loans 6 months, taking into account cross-currency and interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps were also used for trading purposes in 2005. As of December 31, the Group had net current financial assets (current financial assets less total loans) of MSEK 678 (2,449 and 4,724). A change of one percentage point in interest rates influences profit before taxes by approximately MSEK 11. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk, also referred to as funding risk, is defined as the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in raising funds to meet commitments. Group policy states that in addition to current loan financing, the Group should have a payment capacity in form of available liquidity and/or long-term committed credit facilities not falling below MEUR 300. In addition to own liquidity the Group had committed credit facilities of MEUR 300 syndicated by 10 banks at December 31, 2005. These facilities, which are unutilized, will expire in 2012. Available liquidity as per December 31 amounted to MSEK 4,886 (3,565 and 6,342). Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the Group’s exposure to losses in the event that one party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation. The Group deals only with well-established international financial institutions. The Group does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial derivative instruments subject to credit risk. The Group’s policy states that only well established financial institutions are approved as counterparties. The major part of these financial institutions have signed an ISDA-agreement (International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.). Transactions are made within fixed limits and exposure per counterparty is continuously monitored. For financial derivative instruments and investments, the Group’s credit risk exposure related to the two counterparties with the largest concentration of risks was MSEK 852 and MSEK 632, respectively, at December 31, 2005. 14 The Group’s concentration of credit risk related to trade receivables is relatively limited primarily because of its many geographically and industrially diverse customers. Trade receivables are subject to credit limit control and approval procedures in all subsidiaries. Changes in manufacturing cost Changes in cost associated with various levels of operations including, but not limited to, effects of unplanned work stoppages, cost of labour, and the cost and availability of materials and energy could have a material adverse effect on SKF’s business and results of operations. The primary raw material used by the Group is steel. SKF believes that adequate supplies of necessary raw materials are available for the Group's operations. Changes in costs for raw material The annual cost of the purchase of raw material and components is approximately SEK 11 billion. Of this amount, steel bars, tubes, components or oil-based products account for the major part. The price of bearing steel increased sharply during 2004 and remained at a high level during 2005. For the full-year 2005, these increases were compensated by price increases, higher efficiency, cost reductions and by alternative sourcing. An increase of 1% in the cost of raw material and components reduces profit before taxes by MSEK 111. Environmental matters As an industrial company, SKF is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, waste water discharge and solid and hazardous waste disposal. SKF’s manufacturing operations are designed to prevent or minimize environmental pollution. However, like other long-established industrial companies, SKF is involved in some remediation projects, resulting from historical activities. SKF has made its best estimate of environmental provisions for a number of locations and several superfund sites designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. state agencies and the authorities in several other countries. A superfund site is an old landfill or plant site in the United States with soil or groundwater contamination, subject to a remediation programme according to federal law. Remediation funding is provided by those who contributed to the contamination. Although SKF believes that the ultimate resolution of these issues will not have a material impact on its financial position, it can give no assurance that it will not have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. In addition, stricter environmental laws and regulations, sometimes with retroactive effect, may lead to increased expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Furthermore, accidental environmental pollution may also expose the Group to substantial liability that could have a material adverse effect on SKF’s result of operations. Environmental provisions The Group has made its best estimate of expected environmental provisions for a number of locations and several superfund sites designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. state agencies and the authorities in several other countries. Management believes the ultimate resolution of these issues will not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Group, but no assurance can be given that actual costs may not exceed the estimates. 15 Unanticipated claims Unanticipated claims including, but not limited to, claims or problems related to intellectual property, product warranty and product liability could have a material adverse effect on SKF’s business and results of operations. 16 ITEM
