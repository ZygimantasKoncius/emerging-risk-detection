ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS For purposes of this section, the term stockholders means the holders of shares of our common stock. Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our stockholders. You should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company, our properties and our business. The occurrence of any of the following risks might cause our stockholders to lose all or a part of their investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other risks that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition. Some statements in this report including statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this report. 11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Risks related to our business The market for the sale of goods over the Internet is developing in Latin America, and our business depends on the continued growth of online commerce, and the availability and suitability of the Internet in Latin America. The market for the sale of goods over the Internet is a new and emerging market in Latin America. Our future revenues depend substantially on Latin American consumers widespread acceptance and use of the Internet as a way to conduct commerce. Rapid growth in the use of and interest in the Internet (particularly as a way to conduct commerce) is a recent phenomenon, and we cannot assure you that this acceptance and use will continue to exist or develop. For us to grow our user base successfully, consumers who have historically used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods must accept and use new ways of conducting business and exchanging information. Furthermore, the price of personal computers and Internet access may limit our potential growth in countries with low levels of Internet penetration and/or high levels of poverty. In addition, the Internet may not be commercially viable in Latin America in the long term for a number of reasons, including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies, performance improvements and security measures. The infrastructure for the Internet may, however, not be able to support continued growth in the number of Internet users, their frequency of use or their bandwidth requirements. In addition, the Internet could lose its viability due to delays in telecommunications technological developments, or due to increased government regulation. If telecommunications services change or are not sufficiently available to support the Internet, response times would be slower, which would adversely affect use of the Internet and our service in particular. Our future success depends on our ability to expand and adapt our operations to meet rapidly changing industry and technology standards in a cost-effective and timely manner, and on the continued market acceptance of our products and services. We plan to expand our operations by developing and promoting new and complementary services. We may not be able to expand our operations in a cost-effective or timely manner, and our expansion efforts may not have the same or greater overall market acceptance as our current services. Furthermore, any new business or service that we launch that is not favorably received by consumers could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name. To expand our operations we will also need to spend significant amounts in development, operations and other resources, and we would place strain on our management, financial and operational resources. Similarly, a lack of market acceptance of these services or our inability to generate satisfactory revenues from any expanded services to offset their cost could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Internet regulation in the countries where we operate is scarce, and several legal issues related to the Internet are uncertain. We are subject to a number of other laws and regulations, and governments may enact laws or regulations that could adversely affect our business. Unlike the United States, none of the countries where we operate have specific laws governing the liability of Internet service providers, such as ourselves, for fraud, intellectual property infringement, other illegal activities committed by individual users or third-party infringing content hosted on a providers servers. This legal uncertainty allows for different judges or courts to decide very similar claims in different ways and establish contradictory jurisprudence. Certain judges may decide that Internet service providers are liable to an intellectual property owner for a users sale of counterfeit items using our platform, while others may decide that the responsibility lies solely with the offending user. This legal uncertainty allows for rulings against us and could set adverse precedents, which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, legal uncertainty may negatively affect our clients perception and use of our services. We are not currently subject to direct government regulation in most of the countries where we operate, other than those regulations applicable to businesses in general. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as general commercial activities, property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel and defamation, obscenity, and personal privacy apply to online businesses. The majority of these laws were adopted before the Internet was available and, as a 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet. Due to these areas of legal uncertainty, and the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that new laws and regulations are adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services. These laws and regulations could cover issues such as online commerce, Internet service providers responsibility for third party content hosted in their servers, user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation (including imposition of value added or sales taxes collection obligations), advertising, intellectual property rights, consumer protection and information security. If these laws are enacted they may have negative effects on our business, results of operation and financial condition. As our activities and the types of goods listed on our web site grow, regulatory agencies or courts may argue or rule that we or our users must either obtain licenses or not be allowed to conduct business in their jurisdiction, either with respect to our services in general or only relating to certain items, such as auctions, real estate and motor vehicles. For example, numerous jurisdictions, including Brazil and Argentina, have regulations regarding auctions and auctioneers and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers. Attempted enforcement of these laws against us or our users and other regulatory and licensing claims could result in expensive litigation or could require us to change the way we or our users do business. Any changes in our or our users business methods could increase costs or reduce revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items for some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties, and any of these outcomes could harm our business. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide, other foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. As we expand and localize our international activities, we have to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. Laws regulating Internet companies outside of the Latin American jurisdictions where we operate may be more restrictive to us than those in Latin America. In order to comply with these laws we may have to change our business practices or restrict our services. We could be subject to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to bans on our services for failure to comply with foreign laws. We are subject to laws relating to the use, storage and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users, especially financial information. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. If we violate these laws, which in many cases apply not only to third-party transactions but also to transfers of information among ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relations, we could be subject to significant penalties and negative publicity, which would adversely affect us. Our business is an Internet platform for commercial transactions in which all commercial activity depends on our users and is therefore largely outside of our control. Our business is dependent on Internet users listing and purchasing their items and services on our Internet platform. Therefore, we depend on the commercial activity, including both sales and purchases that our users generate. We do not choose which items will be listed, nor do we make pricing or other decisions relating to the products and services bought and sold on our platform. Therefore, the principal drivers of our business are largely outside of our control, and we depend on the continued preference for our platform of millions of individual users. We could face liability for the sale of regulated and prohibited items, unpaid items or undelivered purchases, and the sale of defective items. Laws specifying the scope of liability of providers of online services for activities of their users through their service are currently unsettled in the Latin American countries where we operate. Even though we have implemented clear policies that are written into our terms of use that prohibit the sale of certain items on our platform and have implemented programs to monitor and exclude unlawful goods and services, we may be unable to prevent our users from exchanging unlawful goods or services or exchanging goods in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for the unlawful activities of these users. More specifically, we are aware that certain goods, such as alcohol, tobacco, firearms, adult material and other goods that may be subject to regulation by local or national authorities of various jurisdictions have been traded on the MercadoLibre marketplace. As 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements a consequence of these transactions, we have at times been subject to fines in Brazil for certain users sale of products that have not been approved by the government. We cannot assure that we will successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities that our users carry out through our service in the future. If we suffer potential liability for any unlawful activities of our users, we may need to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, which may require, among other things, which we spend substantial resources and/or discontinue certain service offerings. Any costs that we incur as a result of this liability or asserted liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe that government and consumer protection agencies have received a substantial number of complaints about both the MercadoLibre marketplace and MercadoPago. We believe that these complaints are small as a percentage of our total transactions, but they could become large in aggregate numbers over time. In fact, various governmental regulatory agencies have already contacted us from time to time with questions about our operations and may continue to do so. If during these inquiries any of our processes are found to violate laws on consumer protection, or to constitute unfair business practices, we could be subject to an enforcement action, fines or penalties. Such actions or fines could require us to restructure our business processes in ways that would harm our business, and to incur substantial costs. In addition, our success depends largely upon sellers accurately representing and reliably delivering the listed goods and buyers paying the agreed purchase price. We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, complaints from users who did not receive the purchase price or the goods agreed to be exchanged. While we can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users, we do not have the ability to require users to make payments or deliver goods sold. We also receive complaints from buyers regarding the quality of the goods purchased or the partial or non-delivery of purchased items. We have tried to reduce our liability to buyers for unfulfilled transactions or other claims related to the quality of the purchased goods by offering a free Buyer Protection program to buyers who meet certain conditions. Although the number of claims that we have paid through this program is not currently significant, payments made during 2007 totaled $0.1 million, we may in the future receive additional requests from users requesting reimbursement or threatening legal action against us if we do not reimburse them. Any resulting litigation related to unpaid or undelivered purchases could be expensive for us, divert managements attention and could result in increased costs of doing business. In addition, any negative publicity generated as a result of the fraudulent or deceptive conduct of our users could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name. We could potentially face legal and financial liability for the sale of items that infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and for information disseminated on the MercadoLibre marketplace. Even though we monitor listings on our web sites, we are not able to detect every item that may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. As a result, we have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, complaints alleging that certain items listed and/or sold through the MercadoLibre marketplace infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have been active in defending their rights against online companies, including us. We have taken steps to work in coordination and cooperation with the intellectual property rights owners to eliminate allegedly infringing items listed in the MercadoLibre marketplace. Our user policy prohibits the sale of goods which may infringe third-party intellectual property rights, and we may suspend the account of any user who infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Despite all these measures, an allegation of infringement could result in litigation against us. Specifically, allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have already resulted in claims against us from time to time, including litigation in Brazil brought by Cartier International B.V., Montblanc Simplo Gmbh, Richemont International S.A., Puma Sports Ltda., Lacoste do Brasil Indústria e Comrcio Ltda., Sporloisirs S.A., Qix Skateboards Indústria e Comrcio Ltda, Vintage Denim Ltda., Editora COC Empreendimentos Culturais Ltda., Barros Fischer e Associados Ltda., Fallms Distribuição de Fitas Ltda., 100% Nacional Distribuidora de Fitas Ltda., Xuxa Promoções e Produções Artísticas Limitada, Praetorium Instituto de Ensino, Pesquisas e Atividades de Extensāo e Direito Ltda., Sette Informações Educacionāis Ltda., Serasa S.A. and Botelho Industria e Distribuiçāo Cinematográfica Ltda. While we have been largely successful to date in settling existing claims by agreeing to monitor 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the brands and have not paid any damages, the current lack of laws regarding the Internet results in great uncertainty as to the outcome of any future claims. We continue to have outstanding litigation and, although we intend to defend each of these claims, we cannot assure you that we will be successful. This type of litigation is expensive for us, could result in damage awards or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgments or settlements, could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, or could otherwise harm our business. Litigation against other online companies could result in interpretations of the law that could also require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, if the public perception were that counterfeit items are commonplace on our site, it could damage our reputation and our business. It is also possible that third parties could bring claims against online services companies for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services. Other online services companies are facing several lawsuits for this type of liability. As mentioned previously, the liability of online services companies for content hosted, information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unclear in the Latin American countries where we operate. This could allow for claims being made against us by purportedly aggrieved third parties. For example, the MercadoLibre service contains a User Feedback feature, which includes reviews and ratings from users regarding the reliability of other users in paying or delivering goods sold in a transaction promptly. Although users generate all the feedback, it is possible that a party could bring a claim for defamation or other injury against us for content posted through the User Feedback feature. If we or other online services providers are held liable or potentially liable for information carried on or disseminated through our services, we may have to implement measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. Any measures we may need to implement may involve spending substantial resources and/or to discontinuing certain services. Any such costs that we incur as a result of liability or asserted liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, attention to liability issues, lawsuits and legislative proposals could impact the growth of Internet use, and subsequently have a negative impact on our business results. We have only recently achieved profitability in a new and rapidly evolving market, and we may not continue to be profitable. We were incorporated in Delaware in October of 1999 and commenced operations in Argentina in August of 1999, in Brazil in October of 1999, in Mexico in November of 1999 and in Uruguay in December of 1999. Our operations in the remaining Latin American countries where we operate have all been launched after January of 2000, including our launch in Costa Rica, Panama and the Dominican Republic as recently as December of 2006. Our net income and cash flow from operations were negative from the time we commenced operations in 1999 until 2004. Accordingly, we have a limited history of profits and positive cash flow operations on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. You must consider our prospects in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties that companies in their early stages of development frequently encounter, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as online commerce. Because our business has evolved rapidly and we have a limited operating history, and an even more limited history of profit and positive cash flow, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of future performance. Furthermore, as a result of our limited operating history, the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, the increased variety of services offered on our web site and the rapidly evolving nature of our business, it is particularly difficult for us to forecast our revenues or earnings accurately. In addition, we have no backlog and substantially all of our net revenues for each quarter are derived from listing fees, optional feature fees, final value fees, commissions on MercadoPago payments and advertising that are earned during that quarter. Our current and future expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues and are, to a large extent, fixed. We may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements If we continue to grow, we may not be able to appropriately manage the increased size of our business. We are currently experiencing a period of significant expansion and anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth in our customer base and market opportunities. This expansion has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on management, and our operational and financial resources. We must constantly add new hardware, update software, enhance and improve our billing and transaction systems, and add and train new engineering and other personnel to accommodate the increased use of our web site and the new products and features we regularly introduce. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increasing complexity and enhancement of our web site results in higher costs. Failure to upgrade our technology, features, transaction processing systems, security infrastructure, or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could harm our business. Adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of customer support, impaired quality of users experiences of our services and delays in reporting accurate financial information. Our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes. Our failure to grow our transaction-processing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on our web site would harm our business and our ability to collect revenue. Furthermore, we may need to enter into relationships with various strategic partners, web sites and other online service providers and other third parties necessary to our business. The increased complexity of managing multiple commercial relationships could lead to execution problems that can affect current and future revenues, and operating margins. Our current and planned systems, procedures and controls, personnel and third party relationships may not be adequate to support our future operations. Our failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our systems may fail or suffer interruptions due to human acts, technical problems, or natural disasters. Our success, and in particular our ability to facilitate trades successfully and provide high quality customer service, depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems. Substantially all of our computer hardware for operating the MercadoLibre marketplace and MercadoPago services is currently located at the facilities of the Savvis Datacenter in Sterling, Virginia, with a redundant database backup in Miami, Florida. These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar events. If our system suffers a major failure, it would take as much as several days to get the service running again because our Miami database is only a backup with very limited hardware. We also have no formal disaster recovery plan or alternative providers of hosting services and do not carry business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Despite any precautions we have taken and plan to take, if there is a natural disaster or major failure, a decision by our providers to close one of the facilities we use without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problem at the Virginia or Florida facilities, the services we provide could suffer interruptions. We currently have no plans to upgrade the Florida facility capabilities. Additionally, in the occurrence of such pronounced, frequent or persistent system failures, our reputation and name brand could be materially adversely affected. We are subject to security breaches or other confidential data theft from our systems, which can adversely affect our reputation and business. A significant risk associated with online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Currently, a number of MercadoLibre users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts or debit their bank accounts directly, or use MercadoPago for all the transaction fees that we charge. We rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication technology to transmit confidential information securely, including customer credit card numbers and other account information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect customer transaction 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements data. If our security were compromised, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation. We cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent them will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We depend on key personnel, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our performance depends substantially on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our ability to retain and motivate these and other officers and employees is fundamental to our performance. Our most senior executive officers have been with us since 2000 or before, providing us with a stable and experienced management team. The loss of the services of any of these executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key technical personnel other than our senior executives (whose agreements are for an undetermined period and establish general employment terms and conditions) and maintain no key person life insurance policies. The option grants to most of our senior management and key employees are fully vested. Therefore, these employees may not have sufficient financial incentive to stay with us. Consequently we may have to incur costs to replace key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business model could be impaired if we cannot replace them in a timely manner. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract, integrate, train, retain, motivate and manage sufficiently qualified personnel. Currently our revenues depend substantially on the listing, optional feature and final value fees we charge to sellers and may decrease if market conditions force us to lower such fees or if we fail to diversify our sources of revenue. Currently our revenues depend primarily on listing, optional feature and final value fees that we charge to our sellers for listing and upon selling their items and services, which together represented 88.4% of our revenues for 2005, 85.0% for 2006 and 80.5% for 2007 (the remainder of our revenues consist of advertising revenues and MercadoPago revenues). Our platform depends upon providing access to a large market at a lower cost than other comparable alternatives. If market conditions force us to substantially lower our listing or final value fees or if we fail to continue to attract new buyers and sellers, and if we are unable to effectively diversify and expand our sources of revenue, our profitability, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. MercadoPago is subject to similar market pressure on the commissions charged for provision of its service. We are subject to consumer trends and could lose revenue if certain items become less popular. We derive substantially all of our revenues from fees charged to sellers for listing products for sale on our service, fees charged to sellers who purchase optional features, fees from successfully completed transactions and fees for making payments through MercadoPago. Our future revenues depend on continued demand for the types of goods that users list on the MercadoLibre marketplace. The popularity of certain categories of items, such as cellular telephones, other electronics, toys, clothing and sporting goods, among consumers may vary over time due to perceived availability, subjective value, and trends of consumers and society in general. A decline in the demand for or popularity of certain items sold through the MercadoLibre marketplace without an increase in demand for different items could reduce the overall volume of transactions on the MercadoLibre service, resulting in reduced revenues. In addition, certain consumer fads may temporarily inflate the volume of certain types of items listed on the MercadoLibre marketplace, placing a significant strain on our infrastructure and transaction capacity. These trends may also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from one quarter to the next. 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The success of eBay and other e-commerce companies is not an indication of our future financial performance. Several companies that operate e-commerce web sites, such as eBay, have been successful and profitable in the past. However, we operate in a business environment that is different from eBays and other e-commerce companies operating outside of Latin America. These differences include the smaller size of the national markets, lower Internet adoption rates, lower confidence in remote payment mechanisms and less reliable postal and parcel services. Therefore, you should not interpret the success of any of these companies as indicative of our financial prospects. We could be subject to liability and forced to change our MercadoPago business practices if we were found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations governing banking, money transmission, or electronic funds transfers in any country where we operate. A number of jurisdictions where we operate have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters. We believe we do not require a license under the existing statutes of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela to operate MercadoPago with its current agency-based structure. If our operation of MercadoPago were found to be in violation of money services laws or regulations, or engaged in an unauthorized banking business, we could be subject to liability, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain countries, or forced to change our business practices. Any change to our MercadoPago business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the speed of trade on the MercadoLibre marketplace, which would further harm our business. Even if we are not forced to change our MercadoPago business practices, we could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could be very expensive and time consuming, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain these licenses in a timely manner or at all. MercadoPago is susceptible to illegal uses, and we could potentially face liability for any illegal use of MercadoPago. MercadoPago, like the MercadoLibre platform, is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including, fraudulent and illicit sales, money laundering, bank fraud, and online securities fraud. In addition, MercadoPagos service could be subject to unauthorized credit card use, identity theft, break-ins to withdraw account balances, employee fraud or other internal security breaches, and we may be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches. Merchants could also request reimbursement, or stop using MercadoPago, if they are affected by buyer fraud. In addition, MercadoPago may be subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations that prohibit, among other things, its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. Because of different laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate, as we roll-out and adapt MercadoPago in other countries, additional verification and reporting requirements could apply. These regulations could impose significant costs on us and make it more difficult for new customers to join the MercadoPago network. Future regulation (under the USA Patriot Act or otherwise), may require us to learn more about the identity of our MercadoPago customers before opening an account, to obtain additional verification of customers and to monitor our customers activities more closely. These requirements, as well as any additional restrictions imposed by credit card associations, could raise our MercadoPago costs significantly and reduce the attractiveness of MercadoPago. Failure to comply with money laundering laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, and forfeiture of significant assets. We incur losses from claims that customers did not authorize a purchase, from buyer fraud and from erroneous transmissions. For 2006, MercadoPagos transaction loss arising from charge backs from unrecognized credit card payments totaled $1.2 million, representing 1.3% of MercadoPagos total payment volume and 15.8% of net revenues of MercadoPago. For 2007, this loss totaled $0.9 million, representing 0.6% of MercadoPagos total payment volume and 5.9% of net revenues of MercadoPago. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive they could result in MercadoPago losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. If MercadoPago is unable to accept credit cards, our business will be adversely affected given that credit cards are the most widely used method for funding the MercadoPago accounts. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud on MercadoPago, such as running address verification system (AVS) and card security code (CSC) 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements checks in some countries, asking users to fax extra documentation for higher risk transactions, caps on overall spending per users and data mining to detect potentially fraudulent transactions. However, these measures may not be effective against current and new forms of fraud. If these measures do not succeed, excessive charge-backs may arise in the future and our business will be adversely affected. Our failure to manage MercadoPago customer funds properly would harm our business. Our ability to manage and account accurately for MercadoPago customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. We have neither an established operating history nor proven management experience in maintaining, over a long term, these internal controls. As our MercadoPago business continues to grow, we must strengthen our internal controls accordingly. MercadoPagos success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain necessary controls or to properly manage customer funds could severely reduce customer use of MercadoPago. MercadoPago is a new service that faces competition from other payment methods, and competitors may adversely affect the success of MercadoPago. MercadoPago competes with existing online and offline payment methods, including, among others, banks and other providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit cards, checks, money orders, and electronic bank deposits; international online payments services such as Paypal and Google Checkout, and local players such as DineroMail in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, and PagSeguro in Brazil; money remitters such as Western Union; the use of cash, which is often preferred in Latin America; and offline funding alternatives such as cash deposit and money transmission services. Some of these services may operate at lower commission rates than MercadoPagos current rates. MercadoPagos competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than us. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services than we do for MercadoPago. Competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and create greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than MercadoPago. Established banks and other financial institutions currently offer online payments and those which do not yet provide such a service could quickly and easily develop it. We are currently in the process of rolling out a new fee scale and structure for MercadoPago, in order to achieve better monetization of transactions. While we have already launched the new fee scale in Colombia and Chile, we anticipate to roll out this new fee scale to all markets where we operate during 2008. Customers may not accept this new fee structure, which could result in decreased use of MercadoPago, and therefore, have the opposite effect as the one intended. In addition, the transition to the new system may not be a smooth one. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business. We continue to expand MercadoPagos services internationally. We have no experience with the online payments business in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru or Uruguay. In order to introduce MercadoPago in some countries we may require a close commercial relation with one or more local banks. These or other factors may prevent, delay or limit our introduction of MercadoPago in other countries, or reduce its profitability. We rely on banks or payment processors to fund transactions, and changes to credit card association fees, rules or practices may adversely affect our business. Because MercadoPago is not a bank, we cannot belong to or directly access credit card associations, such as Visa and MasterCard. As a result, we must rely on banks or payment processors to process the funding of MercadoPago transactions and MercadoLibre marketplace collections, and must pay a fee for this service. From time to time, credit card associations may increase the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards. The credit card processors of MercadoPago and the MercadoLibre marketplace have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. These increased fees increase the operating costs of MercadoPago, reduce our profit margins from MercadoPago operations and, to a lesser degree, affect the operating margins of the MercadoLibre marketplace. 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We are also required by MercadoPago and MercadoLibre´s processors to comply with credit card association operating rules. The credit card associations and their member banks set and interpret the credit card rules. Some of those member banks compete with MercadoPago. Visa, MasterCard, American Express or other credit card companies could adopt new operating rules or re-interpret existing rules that we or MercadoPagos processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow. As a result, we could lose our ability to give MercadoPago customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments and MercadoLibre users the option to pay their fees using a credit card. If MercadoPago were unable to accept credit cards, our MercadoPago business would be adversely affected. We could lose the right to accept credit cards if MasterCard and/or Visa determine that users are using MercadoPago to engage in illegal or high risk activities. We must prevent high risk merchants from using MercadoPago. We have not incurred fines from MercadoPagos credit card processor relating to our failure to detect the use of MercadoPago by high risk merchants. However, in Brazil, in January of 2006 MasterCard informed us that they could not advance our receivables temporarily due to a high level of cancellations. That decision was reversed in February of the same year. Changes in MercadoPagos funding mix could adversely affect MercadoPagos results. MercadoPago pays significant transaction fees when senders fund payment transactions using credit cards, PagoMisCuentas and Pago Fácil, nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions from their bank accounts in Brazil and Mexico, and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing MercadoPago account balance. Senders funded approximately 67.2% and 72.8% of MercadoPagos payment volume using credit cards during 2006 and 2007, respectively (either in a single payment or in installments), and MercadoPagos financial success will remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards. Senders may prefer credit card funding rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons, including the ability to pay in installments in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, the ability to dispute and reverse charges if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described, the ability to earn frequent flyer miles or other incentives offered by credit cards, the ability to defer payment, or a reluctance to provide bank account information to us. We have no business insurance coverage, which would require us to spend significant resources in the event of a disruption of our services or other contingency. Insurance companies in Latin America offer limited business insurance products. We do not carry any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations. Any business disruption, litigation, system failure or natural disaster may cause us to incur substantial costs and divert resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. We may not be able to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. We could potentially face claims alleging that our technologies infringe the property rights of others. We regard the protection of our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our future success and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and certain contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, and certain suppliers and strategic partners in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot assure you that these contractual arrangements or the other steps that we have taken or will take in the future to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent third-parties from developing similar or competing technologies. We pursue the registration of our trademarks and service marks in each country where we operate, in the United States and in certain other Latin American countries. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, domain name and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available online. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our licensees maintain the quality of the MercadoLibre brand, our licensees may take actions that could materially adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To date, we have not been notified that our technology infringes the proprietary rights of third parties, but third parties may claim infringement on our part with respect to past, current or future technologies or features of our services. We expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in the e-commerce segment grows. Any of these claims could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. Since 2001, eBay has been subject to a lawsuit alleging infringement of patents relating to online consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems. In September 2001, MercExchange LLC filed a complaint against eBay and their subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging infringement of three patents (relating to online consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems) and seeking a permanent injunction and damages (including treble damages for willful infringement). Following a trial and jury verdict, in August 2003, the court entered judgment for MercExchange in the amount of approximately $30 million plus pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest, but refused to grant an injunction. eBay appealed the verdict and judgment in favor of MercExchange, and MercExchange filed a cross-appeal. In May, 2006, following appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ruled that an outright denial of an injunction in a patent case is not appropriate, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On August 28, 2006, MercExchange renewed its motion for a permanent injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Final briefs on such motion were filed in March 2007, and in July 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia denied MercExchanges motion for permanent injunction. MercExchange subsequently entered a notice of appeal. In December 2007, the court entered judgment for MercExchange for $25 million plus prejudgment and post judgment interest. eBay subsequently entered a notice of appeal. In February 2008, eBay and all parties involved agreed to settle and dismiss all claims and appeals stemming from the lawsuit. As a part of the settlement, eBay will purchase all three patents involved in the lawsuit, and related technology and inventions, as well as a license to another search-related patent portfolio that was not asserted in the lawsuit. We filed our first three applications to register the name MercadoLivre in Brazil with the Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (the National Institute of Industrial Property, or INPI) on October 7, 1999. Editora Livre Mercado Ltda., a publishing company, challenged these three applications based on their trademark Livre Mercado, a trade magazine. These challenges are currently pending with INPI. In addition to these processes, Agência Folha de Notícias Ltda., a news company, filed an application to register the name MercadoLivre on October 7, 1999, a few hours before we filed our application. We challenged that application. We may not succeed in obtaining these trademarks or in our challenges to existing or future applications by other parties. If we are not successful, we could face claims by any future trademark owners. Any past or future claims relating to these issues, whether meritorious or not, could cause us to enter into costly royalty and/or licensing agreements. We may also have to modify our brand name in certain countries if any successful demands against us are too expensive. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business expands and we grow larger. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in expensive litigation, require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may not be able to secure licenses for third-party technologies upon which we rely. We also rely on certain technologies that we license from third parties, such as Oracle Corp., SAP AG, and Salesforce.com Inc., the suppliers of key database technology, the operating system and specific hardware components for our services. We cannot assure you that these third-party technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. If we were not able to make use of this technology, we would need to obtain substitute technology that may be of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Problems that affect our third-party service providers could potentially adversely affect us as well. A number of parties provide beneficial services to us or to our users. These services include the hosting of our servers, and the postal and payments infrastructures that allow users to deliver and pay for the goods and services traded amongst themselves, in addition to paying their MercadoLibre marketplace bills. Financial, regulatory, or other problems that might prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our web sites or make completing transactions on our web sites more difficult, which would harm our business. Any security breach at one of these companies could also affect our customers and harm our business. Although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with these third party service providers on acceptable terms, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so in the future. Complaints from customers or negative publicity about our services can diminish consumer confidence and adversely affect our business. Because volume and growth in adoption are key factors for our profitability, customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer service could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services. Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations with our customers. To maintain good customer relations, we need prompt and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes. Effective customer service requires significant personnel expense and investment in developing programs and technology infrastructure to help customer service representatives carry out their functions. These expenses, if not managed properly, could significantly impact our profitability. Failure to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence. As part of our program to reduce fraud losses in relation to MercadoPago, we make use of MercadoPago anti-fraud models and we may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if we identify those funds or the customers account activity as suspicious. MercadoPago has not been subject to any significant negative publicity about this, but a few users who were banned from withdrawing funds started legal actions against us. As a result of our efforts to police the use of our services, MercadoPago may receive negative publicity, our ability to attract new MercadoPago customers may be damaged, and we could become subject to litigation. If any of these events happen, current and future revenues could suffer, and our database technology operating margins may decrease. In addition, negative publicity about or experiences with MercadoPago customer support could cause MercadoLibre´s reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in the MercadoLibre brand. We may not be able to efficiently integrate CMGs operations with our business and may incur unexpected liabilities in connection with our acquisition of CMG. On January 22, 2008, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of CMG and its subsidiaries. We may not be able to successfully integrate CMGs businesses or technologies, which could adversely impact our operations. Furthermore, the integration of CMG may divert our managements time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We may also become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with our acquisition of CMG. Any of these liabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may not realize benefits from recent or future strategic acquisitions of businesses, technologies, services or products despite their costs in cash and dilution to our stockholders. We intend to continue to acquire businesses, technologies, services or products, as we have done in the past with our acquisitions of iBazar, Lokau, and DeRemate, and our acquisition of CMG, which we believe are strategic if an appropriate opportunity presents itself. We may not, however, be able to identify, negotiate or finance such future acquisitions successfully or at favorable valuations, or to effectively integrate these acquisitions with our current business. The process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into our business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Moreover, future acquisitions may also generate unforeseen pressures and/or strains on our organizational culture. Additionally, acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If financing is available, it might cause the dilution of our common stock. We are subject to seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations. We believe that our results of operations are somewhat seasonal in nature (as is the case with traditional retailers), with relatively fewer listings and transactions in the first quarters of the year, and increased activity as the year-end shopping season initiates. This seasonality is the result of fewer listings after the Christmas and other holidays and summer vacation periods in our Southern hemisphere markets. To some degree, our historical rapid growth may have overshadowed seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date. Seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations could become more pronounced over time, which could materially adversely affect our quarter to quarter results of operations in the future. We have spent significant resources to launch and market classified advertisements on the MercadoLibre marketplace, which may not be successful in generating sufficient revenues for us. In order to address the specific needs of buyers and sellers of motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, real estate and services, we created classified advertisements in the MercadoLibre marketplace. We have spent considerable resources in creating and marketing this space. However, this investment may not be successful in generating additional revenues for us and we may incur losses from offering this service. These losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive and evolving market, and therefore face potential reductions in the use of our service. The market for trading over the Internet is relatively new in Latin America, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we expect competition to become more intense in the future. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and current and new competitors can launch new sites at a relatively low cost using software that is commercially available. We currently or potentially compete with a number of other companies. Our direct competitors include various online sales and auction services, including DeRemate in Chile and Argentina, MasOportunidades.com in Argentina, and a number of other small services, including those that serve specialty markets. We also compete with business-to-consumer online e-commerce services, such as B2W Inc. in Brazil and with shopping comparison sites, such as Buscap and Bondfaro, located throughout Latin America. In addition, we compete with online communities that specialize in classified advertisements. We face competition from a number of large online communities and services that have expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating online interaction. Certain of these competitors, including Google, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Yahoo! currently offer a variety of business-to-consumer trading services, searching services and classified advertising services, and certain of these companies may introduce broader online trading to their large user populations. Other large companies 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements with strong brand recognition and experience in online commerce, such as large newspaper or media companies also compete in the online listing market. We also compete with traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to the extent buyers choose to purchase products in a physical establishment as opposed to on our platform. Any or all of these companies could create competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We no longer have a non-competition arrangement with eBay. If eBay were to compete directly with us by launching a competing platform in Latin America, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects. Similarly, eBay or other larger, well-established and well-financed companies may acquire, invest in or enter into other commercial relationships with competing online trading services. Therefore, some of our competitors and potential competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to web site and systems development than us, which could adversely affect us. In many cases, companies that directly or indirectly compete with us provide Internet access. These competitors include incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and large Internet service providers. Some of these providers may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of customers use of our services. For example, they could restrict or prohibit the use of their lines for our services, filter, block or delay the packets containing the data associated with our products, charge increased fees to us or our users for use of their lines to provide our services, or seek to charge us for our customers use of our services or receipt of our e-mails. These activities are technically feasible. Although we have not identified any providers who intend to take these actions, any interference with our services or higher charges for access to the Internet, could cause us to lose existing users, impair our ability to attract new users, limit our potential expansion and harm our revenue and growth. Risks related to doing business in Latin America We face the risk of political and economic crises, instability, terrorism, civil strife, expropriation and other risks of doing business in emerging markets. We conduct our operations in emerging market countries in Latin America. Economic and political developments in these countries, including future economic changes or crises (such as inflation, currency devaluation or recession), government deadlock, political instability, terrorism, civil strife, changes in laws and regulations, expropriation or nationalization of property, and exchange controls could impact our operations or the market value of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the past, the performance of the economies of Latin American countries has been affected by each countrys political situation. For example, during its crisis in 2001 and 2002, Argentina experienced social and political turmoil, including civil unrest, riots, looting, protests, strikes and street demonstrations. Government policies to preempt such civil, social and political turmoil affected the Argentine economy. More recently, the Venezuelan and Bolivian administrations have nationalized or announced plans to nationalize certain industries and expropriate certain companies and property, and, in Venezuela, the administration has imposed exchange controls. Although economic conditions in one country may differ significantly from another country, we cannot assure that events in one country alone will not adversely affect the market value of, or market for, our common stock. Latin American governments have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over the economies of the countries where we operate. This involvement, as well as political and economic conditions, could adversely affect our business. Governments in Latin America frequently intervene in the economies of their respective countries and occasionally make significant changes in policy and regulations. Governmental actions to control inflation and other policies and regulations have often involved, among other measures, price controls, currency devaluations, capital controls and limits on imports. Our business, financial 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected by changes in government policies or regulations, including such factors as: exchange rates and exchange control policies; inflation rates; interest rates; tariff and inflation control policies; import duties on information technology equipment; liquidity of domestic capital and lending markets; electricity rationing; tax policies; and other political, diplomatic, social and economic developments in or affecting the countries where we operate. An eventual reduction of foreign investment in any of the countries where we operate may have a negative impact on such countrys economy, affecting interest rates and the ability of companies such as ourselves to access financial markets. Latin America has experienced adverse economic conditions. Latin American countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and economic instability. Certain countries have experienced severe economic crises, which may still have future effects. For example, in 2001 Argentina defaulted on its sovereign debt due to severe economic turmoil. In the first half of 2005, Argentina restructured part of this sovereign debt. Certain creditors did not agree to the restructuring. Argentinas past default and its failure to restructure completely its remaining sovereign debt and fully negotiate with the holdout creditors may prevent Argentina from obtaining favorable terms or interest rates when accessing the international capital markets. Litigation initiated by holdout creditors or other parties may result in material judgments against the Argentine government and could result in attachments of or injunctions relating to assets of Argentina that the government intended for other uses. As a result, the government may not have the financial resources necessary to implement reforms and foster growth, which could have a material adverse effect on the countrys economy. Any of these adverse economic conditions may occur again in the future, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Local currencies used in the conduct of our business are subject to depreciation, volatility and exchange controls. The currencies of many countries in Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, which together accounted for 87.9% of our revenues for 2006 and 86.4% for 2007, have experienced substantial depreciation and volatility, particularly against the U.S. dollar, in the past. However, certain currencies have appreciated against the U.S. dollar in recent years. For example, in 2005, 2006, and 2007, the Brazilian real appreciated against the U.S. dollar by 11.7%, 5.0% and 17.2%, respectively. Currency movements, as well as higher interest rates, have materially and adversely affected the economies of many Latin American countries, including countries which account or are expected to account for a significant portion of our revenues. The depreciation of local currencies creates inflationary pressures that may have an adverse effect on us and generally restricts access to the international capital markets. For example, the devaluation of the Argentine peso has had a negative impact on the ability of Argentine businesses to honor their foreign currency denominated debt, led to very high inflation initially, significantly reduced real wages, had a negative impact on businesses whose success is dependent on domestic market demand, and adversely affected the governments ability to honor its foreign debt obligations. On the other hand, the appreciation of local currencies against the U.S. dollar may lead to the deterioration of the public accounts and balance of payments of the countries where we operate, as well as to a lower economic growth related to exports. We may be subject to exchange control regulations which might restrict our ability to convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. For example, in 2001 and 2002, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. These restrictions have been substantially eased, including those requiring the Central Banks prior authorization for the transfer of funds abroad in order to pay principal and interest on debt obligations. In addition, Brazilian law provides that whenever there is a serious imbalance in Brazils balance of payments or reason to foresee a serious imbalance, the Brazilian government may impose temporary restrictions on the remittance to foreign investors of the proceeds of their investments in Brazil. Currently, Venezuela has certain exchange control regulations in place that restrict our ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars. Any additional imposition of exchange controls could adversely affect our company. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar but our revenues are paid in foreign currencies. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to these foreign currencies (i.e. the foreign currencies devaluate against the U.S. dollar), the economic value of our revenues in U.S. dollar terms will decline. We are subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Because we conduct our business outside the United States and receive almost all of our revenues in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, but report our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies of certain countries where we operate, including most notably Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, have historically experienced significant devaluations. The results of operations in the countries where we operate are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, as occurred in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. For 2007, 59.0% of our revenues were denominated in Brazilian reais, 14.8% in Argentine pesos and 12.6% in Mexican pesos. The foreign currency exchange rates in 2007 relative to 2006 resulted in higher net revenues of approximately $5.8 million and an increase in aggregate cost of net revenues and operating expenses of approximately $4.2 million. While we have entered in the past into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, these are expensive, and in addition it is impossible to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure. Inflation and certain government measures to curb inflation may have adverse effects on the economies of the countries where we operate, our business and our operations. Most Latin American countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation. Inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of Latin American countries. Governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation, coupled with speculation about possible future actions, have contributed to economic uncertainty over the years in most Latin American countries. The Latin American countries where we operate may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation, we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures. A return to a high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Political and economic conditions in Venezuela may have an adverse impact on our operations. We conduct significant operations in Venezuela, offering both our MercadoLibre marketplace and MercadoPago online payments solution, and have 23 employees who work in the country. Additionally, with the acquisition of CMG, we now have more significant operations in Venezuela. Recently, the political and economic conditions have become increasingly volatile and unstable. We cannot predict the impact of any future political and economic events on our business. Also, the Venezuelan National Assembly has granted President Hugo Chávez the power to rule by decree and allowed him the power to carry out the nationalization of certain businesses in the electricity, energy and telecommunication sectors and the Venezuelan government has already nationalized Venezuelas largest telecommunications company. We cannot predict the economic and regulatory impact of President Chávezs initiatives, or whether the Venezuelan government will extend nationalization to e-commerce or other businesses that could impact our business and results of operations. Nationalization of telecommunications, electrical or other companies could reduce our or our customers access to our web site or our services or increase the costs of providing or accessing our services. In addition, the Venezuelan government has imposed foreign exchange and price controls on the local currency. These foreign exchange controls increase our costs to, and also limit our ability to, convert local currency into U.S. dollars and transfer funds out of Venezuela, and may have an adverse effect on our Venezuelan customers. For 2007, we incurred foreign currency loss related to Venezuelan revenue of approximately $2.4 million, compared to approximately $0.5 million for 2006, due to the increased costs of transferring funds out of Venezuela. We cannot predict the long-term effects of exchange controls on our ability to process payments from Venezuelan customers or on the Venezuelan economy in general. Recent political events have also resulted in significant civil unrest in the country. Continuation or worsening of the political and economic conditions in Venezuela could materially and adversely impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Developments in other markets may affect the Latin American countries where we operate, our financial condition and results of operations. The market value of securities of companies such as ourselves, may be, to varying degrees, affected by economic and market conditions in other global markets. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors perception of the events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and securities from issuers in other countries, including Latin American countries. Various Latin American economies have been adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred in several emerging economies in recent times, including Mexico in 1994, the collapse of several Asian economies between 1997 and 1998, the economic crisis in Russia in 1998, the Brazilian devaluations in January of 1999 and in 2002, the Argentine crisis of 2001 and the market decline after September 11, 2001. Furthermore, Latin American economies may be affected by events in developed economies which are trading partners or that impact the global economy. Developments of a similar magnitude to the international markets in the future can be expected to adversely affect the economies of Latin American countries and therefore us. E-commerce transactions in Latin America may be impeded by the lack of secure payment methods. Unlike in the United States, consumers and merchants in Latin America can be held fully liable for credit card and other losses due to third-party fraud. As secure methods of payment for e-commerce transactions have not been widely adopted in Latin America, both consumers and merchants generally have a relatively low confidence level in the integrity of e-commerce transactions. In addition, many banks and other financial institutions have generally been reluctant to give merchants the right to process online transactions due to these concerns about credit card fraud. Unless consumer fraud laws in Latin American countries are modified to protect e-commerce merchants and consumers, and until secure, integrated online payment processing methods are fully implemented across the region, our ability to generate revenues from e-commerce may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our company. Risks related to our shares Our common stock has limited trading history, and the price of our shares may fluctuate substantially, and our stockholders investment may decline in value. Our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on August 10, 2007. The trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those described above under Risks related to our business. Further, the stock markets in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the market for Internet-related and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. We cannot assure you that trading prices and valuations will be sustained. These broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, such as recession or currency exchange rate fluctuations, may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, that company is often subject to securities class-action litigation. This kind of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We continue to be significantly influenced by a group of stockholders that control a significant percentage of our common shares and the value of our common stock could be negatively effected by any significant disposition of our shares by any of these stockholders. Several stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock. As of December 31, 2007, eBay owned approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock (which represents 18.4% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2007). Certain members of our management also hold a significant percentage of our common stock. Investment entities affiliated with General Atlantic LLC, collectively, General Atlantic, and investment entities affiliated with Tiger Global, L.P., collectively, Tiger, beneficially own approximately 3.9 million and 4.3 million shares of our common stock, respectively as of December 31, 2007 (which represent 8.9% and 9.8%, respectively of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2007). These stockholders retain the power to influence the outcome of important corporate decisions or matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may conflict with, or differ from, the interests of other holders of our common shares. For example, these stockholders could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness or outstanding shares of common stock, sell revenue-generating assets or inhibit change of control transactions that benefit other stockholders. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as these stockholders continue to own a substantial number of shares of our common stock, they will significantly influence all our corporate decisions and together with other stockholders may be able to effect or inhibit changes in control of our company. Additionally, the actual sale, communication of an intention to sell or perceptions that any of these stockholders may sell any significant amount of our common stock could negatively impact the market value of our common stock. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us, prevent a change of control, and may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our management. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may inhibit a change of control that our board of directors does not approve or changes in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in the entrenchment of current management. These provisions include:  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;  a staggered board of directors;  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors other than for cause;  limitations on the ability of stockholders to own and/or exercise voting power over 20% of our common stock;  limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal our by-laws;  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent;  the authority of the board of directors to adopt a stockholder rights plan;  the authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with any terms that the board of directors determines and additional shares of our common stock; and  limitations on the ability of certain stockholders to enter into certain business combinations with us, as provided under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. See Description of capital stock for more information. 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may require additional capital in the future, and this additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. We may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion (organically or through strategic acquisitions), to develop new or enhanced services or products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution and the securities that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fund our expansion, take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures. These inabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Certain stockholders or entities controlled by them or their permitted transferees will, subject to the lock-up agreements described below, be able to sell their shares in the public market from time to time without registering them, subject to certain limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Holders of restricted stock will also have the right to cause us to register the resale of shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. Each of General Atlantic and Tiger agreed that, in respect of the shares each purchased in our initial public offering, neither of them would, without our prior written consent, transfer or dispose of directly or indirectly, any of its shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for our shares, for a period of 18 months following the closing of our initial public offering that closed in August 2007. These agreements do not cover shares of our common stock owned by General Atlantic and Tiger that were not purchased in our initial public offering. If any of these stockholders, the affiliated entities controlled by them or their respective permitted transferees were to sell a large number of their shares, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the future, we may issue securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. It is unlikely that we will declare any dividends on our capital stock. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain earnings, if any, for future operations and expansion and debt repayments. In addition, the terms of certain of our credit agreements prohibit the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Requirements associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention. In connection with our initial public offering, we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the other rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market. We are also subject to various other regulatory requirements, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by December 31, 2008. If we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm the trading price of our stock. In addition, in connection with our initial public offering in August 2007, we became subject to the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market. Our compliance with these rules and regulations have and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We currently take advantage of certain grace periods for newly public companies under certain of the new SEC and Nasdaq Global Market rules and regulations, which grace periods provide us a short period of time after we become a public company before we are required to be in full compliance with these rules and regulations. Our ability to satisfy the various requirements before the expiration of the applicable grace periods will depend largely on our ability to attract and retain qualified independent members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, which may be more difficult in light of these new rules and regulations. If we fail to satisfy the various requirements before the expiration of the applicable grace periods, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, which would cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and impair the ability of the holders of our common stock to sell and buy our common stock in a public market. It may be difficult to enforce judgments against us in U.S. courts. Although we are a Delaware corporation, our subsidiaries and most of our assets are located outside of the United States. Furthermore, most of our directors and officers and some experts named in this report reside outside the United States. As a result, you may not be able to enforce against us or our directors or officers in U.S. courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. It is unclear if original actions of civil liabilities based solely upon U.S. federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the United States. It is equally unclear if judgments entered by U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the United States. Any enforcement action in a court outside the United States will be subject to compliance with procedural requirements under applicable local law, including the condition that the judgment does not violate the public policy of the applicable jurisdiction.
