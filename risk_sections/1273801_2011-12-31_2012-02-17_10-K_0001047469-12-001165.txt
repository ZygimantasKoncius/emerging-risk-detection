Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely impact our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. 18 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Businesses The CRE finance industry has been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the U.S. and global financial markets generally. Our business and operations is dependent on the CRE finance industry generally, which in turn is dependent upon broad economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. Despite some recent improvements, the U.S. economy is continuing to experience relatively high unemployment and slow growth. A worsening of economic conditions would likely have a negative impact on the CRE finance industry generally and on our business and operations specifically. Additionally, disruptions in the global economy, whether as a result of the Euro-zone debt crisis, regional conflict or otherwise, may also have a negative impact on the CRE market domestically. Adverse conditions in the CRE finance industry could harm our business and financial condition by, among other factors, reducing the value of our existing assets, limiting our access to debt and equity capital, harming our ability to originate new CRE debt and otherwise negatively impacting our operations. Liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on outside sources of capital that have been negatively impacted by U.S. and global economic conditions. We require significant outside capital to fund and grow our businesses. A primary source of liquidity for us has been the equity and debt capital markets, including issuances of common equity, preferred equity, trust preferred securities and exchangeable senior notes. Access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity was severely disrupted during the relatively recent credit crisis and, despite some improvements in 2011, the markets could suffer another severe downturn and another liquidity crisis could emerge. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms, our business, ability to operate and liquidity could be severely impacted. For information about our available sources of funds, refer to Part II Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsÂ—Liquidity and Capital Resources" and the notes to the consolidated financial statements located in Part II Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our CDO bonds payable have certain coverage tests that are required to be met in order for payments to be made to our retained equity interests in the CDO. Failing coverage tests could significantly impact our cash flow and overall liquidity position. Our CDO bonds payable generally require that the underlying collateral and cash flow generated by the collateral be in excess of ratios stipulated in the related indentures. These overcollateralization, or OC, and interest coverage, or IC, tests are used primarily to determine whether and to what extent principal and interest proceeds on the underlying collateral may be used to pay principal of, and interest on, our retained equity interests in the CDOs. Our CDOs are collateralized by CRE debt and securities, with a majority of our equity invested in our real estate debt CDOs. Uncured defaults on CRE debt and rating agency downgrades on CMBS are the primary causes for decreases in the OC and IC tests. In the event these tests are not met, cash flow that would normally be distributed to us would be used to amortize the senior CDO bonds until the CDO is back in compliance with the tests. Even if we have control because we may have originated a loan and even when we may be able to appoint ourselves as special servicer in connection with a CMBS investment, we may be unable to prevent adverse conditions that could negatively affect our cash flow and overall liquidity position. As of December 31, 2011, all of our real estate debt CDOs were in compliance with their OC and IC tests. Four of our N-Star securities CDOs (I, II, V and VII) were out of compliance with their respective OC tests and we expect that complying with OC and IC tests will continue to be difficult. Weaker than expected economic conditions, deterioration of the CRE market and credit rating downgrades of real estate securities will make complying with OC and IC tests more difficult or even 19 Table of Contents impossible in the future. Our failure to satisfy the coverage tests could adversely affect our operating results, liquidity and cash flows. The reinvestment period for three of our CDOs will expire in 2012 and the reinvestment periods for our other CDOs expired prior to December 31, 2011. During the reinvestment period of our CDOs, we are allowed to reinvest principal payments on the underlying assets into qualifying replacement collateral. The reinvestment period for two of our CDO's (CSE CDO and N-Star CDO VIII) just ended in January 2012 and February 2012, respectively, while the reinvestment period for N-Star CDO IX ends in June 2012. Because we will be unable to reinvest principal in these CDOs after the reinvestment period ends, principal repayments after the reinvestment period ends will pay down the senior bonds, which will delever the CDO and negatively impact our cash flow. Additionally, our ability to reinvest has been instrumental in maintaining OC and IC ratios under our CDOs. Following the end of the reinvestment period in our CDOs, our ability to maintain the OC and IC ratios will be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operation. We retain the equity interests in our CDOs, which entails certain risks, including that these interests are the most junior interests and receive distributions only if the CDO generates enough cash flow to pay all of the other senior CDO bonds. Our retained equity interests in the CDOs represent leveraged investments in the underlying assets. The senior CDO bonds participate in the cash flow in CDOs and distributions on equity interests are generally made only after payment of interest on, and principal of, the senior CDO bonds. Although generally there is no interest or principal due on the equity notes, distributions may be made to us as holders of the equity interests on each payment date only after all of the other required payments are made. There will be little or no cash flow available to our equity interests if there are defaults by the obligors under the underlying collateral and those defaults exceed a certain amount. In that event, the value of our investment in our CDOs could decrease quickly and substantially. There can be no assurance that after making required payments on the senior CDO bonds there will be any remaining funds available to pay us. Accordingly, our equity interests may not be paid in full and we may be subject to a loss of all or part of our interest in the event that payments are not made on the underlying assets or losses are incurred with respect to the underlying assets, which could have a material adverse effect on us. A payment default on our CDO bonds could have a compounding effect on our other CDOs. Certain of our CDOs have invested in CDO bonds issued by other CDOs that we sponsored and/or acquired. Such investments expose us to increased risk, as defaults in any particular CDO would also affect another CDO that owns bonds in the CDO that experiences defaults. Defaults across certain of our CDOs could, therefore, have a material impact on the cash flow of other CDOs that we own that may not have otherwise experienced such an impact. We are unable to complete additional CDOs due to the decreased liquidity in the CRE finance market. We historically accessed the securitization markets to finance our CRE debt and security investments with non-recourse, long-term liabilities which were structured as CDOs. Issuing long-term financing, such as CDO bonds, has historically been an important part of our overall business plan. Despite improvements in market liquidity, we currently believe structured CDO financing may not be available for the foreseeable future, if ever. 20 Table of Contents The documentation governing our CDOs is complex and contains certain ambiguities that are subject to interpretation. Each of our CDOs is governed by an indenture, collateral management agreement and other documentation. The documents are complex and collectively describe the conditions upon which we can sell assets and reinvest principal proceeds and set forth covenants and other provisions to which we and the CDOs are subject. In certain circumstances, the performance of the underlying CDO collateral has raised ambiguities in our CDO documentation. Although we have as a general matter been able to reach agreement with our CDO trustees as to how the CDO documentation should be interpreted, it is possible that we and our CDO trustees may not be able to reach agreement on important CDO documentation provisions in the future. To the extent we and our CDO trustees are unable to resolve any differences in the interpretation of CDO documentation, or if third parties, such as bondholders or other parties, do not agree with conclusions that are reached by us and/or the CDO trustees, our ability to manage the underlying collateral, and thus maintain the IC and OC ratios and otherwise optimize the performance of our CDOs, may be adversely affected. We could take a position, inadvertently or otherwise, that a court ultimately determines constitutes a breach of the underlying agreements and the results of such a determination could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition. Challenging economic and financial market conditions could significantly reduce the amount of income we earn on our CRE debt investments and further reduce the values of our investments. Challenging economic and financial market conditions have caused us to experience an increase in the number of CRE debt investments that result in delinquencies, foreclosures and non-performing assets and a decrease in the value of the property or other collateral which secures our CRE loans, all of that could adversely affect our results of operations. Loan defaults result in a decrease in interest income and may require the establishment of, or an increase in, provision for loan losses. The decrease in interest income resulting from a loan default may continue for a prolonged period of time as we seek to recover, primarily through legal proceedings, the outstanding principal amount, accrued interest and default interest due on a defaulted CRE debt investment. Legal proceedings, which may include foreclosure actions and bankruptcy proceedings, are expensive and time consuming and we may still never recover all or a portion of our principal. The decrease in interest income and the costs involved in pursuing our legal remedies will reduce the amount of cash available to meet our expenses and adversely impact our liquidity and operating results. Real estate debt restructurings may reduce our net interest income. Although the CRE market has exhibited signs of recovery, we may continue to need to restructure our real estate debt investments. In order to preserve long-term value, we are often required to lower the interest rate on our loans in connection with a restructuring, which will have an adverse impact on our net interest margin. We may also determine to extend the time to maturity on our real estate debt investments and make other concessions with the goal of increasing overall value but there is no assurance that the results of our restructurings will be favorable to us. We may be unable to restructure loans in a manner that we believe maximizes value, particularly if we are one of multiple creditors in large capital structures. In the current environment, in order to maximize value we may be more likely to extend and work out a loan, rather than pursue foreclosure. However, in situations where there are multiple creditors in large capital structures, it can be particularly difficult to assess the most likely course of action that a lender group or the borrower may take and it may also be difficult to achieve consensus among the lender group as to major decisions. Consequently, there could be a wide range of potential principal recovery outcomes, the timing of which can be unpredictable, based on the strategy pursued by a 21 Table of Contents lender group and/or by a borrower. These multiple creditor situations tend to be associated with our larger loans. We, as one of a group of lenders, are often a lender on a subordinated basis, and may not independently control the decision making. Consequently, we may be unable to restructure a loan in a manner that we believe would maximize value. Risks associated with our largest multiple creditor loans are described in more detail in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsÂ—Risk Management." We have restructured certain CRE investments in the past in an effort to maximize the value of our investment, however, there is no assurance that our restructurings will be successful and we may still lose some or all of our investment. Examples of CRE investments we have restructured include our: Â•$110 million (22%) equity interest in Meadowlands Two, LLC, which holds 100% of Meadowlands One, LLC, or Meadowlands One, which is secured by a retail/entertainment complex located in East Rutherford, New Jersey, or the NJ Property. During the third quarter 2010, Meadowlands One took effective ownership of the NJ Property. Meadowlands One is in the process of seeking to recapitalize the NJ Property. While Meadowlands One has entered into an agreement with a developer, who is covering the majority of costs of operating the asset, there is no assurance that a recapitalization will be completed or that a recapitalization will be completed on terms acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2011, our carrying value in the NJ Property is $66 million. Â•$89 million mezzanine loan, or the NV Loan, that is secured by the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, or Hard Rock. We, along with certain of the other lenders, and the borrower and its affiliates under the NV Loan, have completed a long-term restructuring of the NV Loan. As part of the restructuring, Brookfield took ownership of Hard Rock and entered into a seven-year loan with the existing senior lender, subject to achieving certain tests, and we retained our $89 million mezzanine loan (or its economic equivalent), as well as an equity participation in Hard Rock. There is no assurance that the restructured NV Loan will be successful over time. As of December 31, 2011, our carrying value in the NV Loan is $45 million. Â•â‚¬43 million participation in a mezzanine loan that is collateralized by a German retail portfolio that is net leased to a single tenant that filed for bankruptcy in Germany, or the German Loan. The German Loan was restructured in 2010 and since restructuring, the loan has been performing. However, there can be no assurance that the German Loan will not default in the future, including at maturity which is July 2014. As of December 31, 2011, our carrying value in the â‚¬43 million participation is $56 million. We may lose a portion or all of our restructured investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Our borrowers may be unable to achieve their business plans due to the difficult U.S. and global economic conditions, which could cause incremental stress in our CRE debt portfolio. Many of our CRE debt investments were made to borrowers who had business plans to improve occupancy and cash flows that have not been accomplished due to the challenging economic conditions. U.S. economic conditions, including high unemployment and slow growth, along with overall financial uncertainty, have resulted in lower occupancy rates and lower lease rates across many property types and created obstacles for our borrowers attempting to achieve their business plans. If our borrowers are unable to achieve their business plans, the related CRE loans could go into default and severely impact our operating results and cash flows. 22 Table of Contents Many of our CRE debt investments are funded with interest reserves and our borrowers may be unable to replenish those interest reserves once they run out. Given the transitional nature of many of our CRE loans, we generally required borrowers to pre-fund reserves to cover interest and operating expenses until the property cash flows increased sufficiently to cover debt service costs. We also generally required the borrower to refill these reserves if they became deficient due to underperformance and if the borrower wanted to exercise extension options under the loan. Despite low interest rates and improving real estate fundamentals, we expect that in the future our borrowers may still have difficulty servicing our debt. Many of our borrowers have only been able to meet their obligations to us because of the reserves we set up at the origination of our loans. We expect that in the future, many of the reserves will run out and some of our borrowers will have difficulty servicing our debt and will not have sufficient capital to replenish reserves, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and cash flow. Our investments have been and may continue to be adversely affected by widening credit spreads. Our investments in CRE debt and securities are subject to changes in credit spreads. When credit spreads widen as they did in 2008 and early 2009, the economic value of our existing investments decrease. Although credit spreads are tighter now than in 2008 and early 2009, if we originated or acquired a new investment today, such investment would likely still carry a greater credit spread than that attributable to our existing investments. Even though such investment may be performing in accordance with its terms and the underlying collateral has not changed, the economic value of our CRE debt and security portfolios have been negatively impacted, and may continue to be negatively impacted, by recent and any further credit spread widening. Additionally, in the past, a source of liquidity for us was the voluntary repayment of loans. A result of the credit crisis has been a severe shortage of debt capital and/or an increased cost of capital for those borrowers needing to refinance maturing loans. If borrowers are not able to refinance loans at their maturity, the loans could go into default and the liquidity that we would receive from such repayments will not be available. Furthermore, given the reduced availability and higher cost of capital in the CRE finance market, borrowers that are performing on their loans will most likely extend such loans if they have that right, which will further delay our ability to access liquidity through repayments. Higher provision for loan losses are expected if economic conditions do not improve significantly. If the U.S. economy does not improve significantly, we will likely continue to experience significant defaults resulting in provision for loan losses and asset impairment charges in 2012. Borrowers may also be less able to pay principal amounts and interest on loans if the economy does not continue to strengthen and they continue to experience financial stress. Declines in real property values also increase loan-to-value ratios on our loans and, therefore, weaken our collateral coverage and increase the likelihood of higher provision for loan losses. Even if our cash flow remains relatively stable, we could suffer significant losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP which could adversely affect our stock price. Provision for loan losses are difficult to estimate in a challenging economic environment. Our provision for loan losses is evaluated on a quarterly basis. Our determination of provision for loan losses requires us to make certain estimates and judgments, which have been, and may continue to be, difficult to determine given the challenges arising from the U.S. economic conditions and recent disruptions in the global markets. While CRE fundamentals have begun to improve, our estimates and judgments are based on a number of factors, including projected cash flows from the collateral securing our CRE debt, structure, including the availability of reserves and recourse guarantees, likelihood of repayment in full at the maturity of a loan, potential for refinancing and expected market discount 23 Table of Contents rates for varying property types, all of which remain uncertain. Our estimates and judgments may not be correct and, therefore, our results of operations and financial condition could be severely impacted. The CRE debt we originate and the commercial mortgage loans underlying the CMBS we invest in are subject to risks of delinquency, foreclosure, loss and bankruptcy of the borrower under the loan. If the borrower defaults, it may result in losses to us. Mortgage loans are secured by real estate and are subject to risks of delinquency, foreclosure, loss and bankruptcy of the borrower, all of which are and will continue to be prevalent if the overall economic environment does not continue to improve. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by real estate is typically dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced or is not increased, depending on the borrower's business plan, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Net operating income of a property can be affected by, among other things: Â•macroeconomic and local economic conditions; Â•tenant mix; Â•success of tenant businesses; Â•property management decisions; Â•property location and condition; Â•property operating costs, including insurance premiums, real estate taxes and maintenance costs; Â•competition from comparable types of properties; Â•changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental legislation; Â•changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged; Â•any need to address environmental contamination at the property; Â•the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property; Â•changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments; Â•declines in regional or local real estate values; Â•branding, marketing and operational strategies; Â•declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates; Â•increases in interest rates; Â•real estate tax rates and other operating expenses; Â•acts of God; Â•social unrest and civil disturbances; Â•terrorism; and Â•increases in costs associated with renovation and/or construction. Any one or a combination of these factors may cause a borrower to default on a loan or to declare bankruptcy. If a default or bankruptcy occurs and the underlying asset value is less than the loan amount, we will suffer a loss. 24 Table of Contents Additionally, we may suffer losses for a number of reasons, including the following, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Â•If the value of real property or other assets securing our CRE debt deteriorates. The majority of our CRE debt portfolio is fully or substantially non-recourse, although a large amount of our CRE debt provides for interest reserve replenishments which are recourse. In the event of a default by a borrower on a non-recourse loan, we will only have recourse to the real estate-related assets (including escrowed funds and reserves, if any) collateralizing the debt. For this purpose, we consider CRE debt made to special purpose entities formed solely for the purpose of holding and financing particular assets to be non-recourse. We sometimes also originate CRE debt that is secured by equity interests in the borrowing entities or by investing directly in the owner of the property. There can be no assurance that the value of the assets securing our CRE debt portfolio will not deteriorate over time due to factors beyond our control, as was the case during the credit crisis and as a result of the recent economic recession. Mezzanine loans are subject to the additional risk that senior lenders may be directly secured by the real estate assets of the borrowing entity, whereas the mezzanine loans may be secured by ownership interests in the borrower. Â•If a borrower or guarantor defaults on recourse obligations under a CRE debt investment. We sometimes obtain personal or corporate guarantees, which are not secured, from borrowers or their affiliates. These guarantees are often triggered only upon the occurrence of certain trigger events. In cases where guarantees are not fully or partially secured, we typically rely on financial covenants from borrowers and guarantors which are designed to require the borrower or guarantor to maintain certain levels of creditworthiness. As a result of the recent economic recession and persisting market conditions, many borrowers and guarantors faced, and continue to face, financial difficulties and were unable, and may continue to be unable, to comply with their financial covenants. If the economy does not strengthen, our borrowers could experience additional financial stress. Where we do not have recourse to specific collateral pledged to satisfy such guarantees or recourse loans, we will only have recourse as an unsecured creditor to the general assets of the borrower or guarantor, some or all of which may be pledged to satisfy other lenders. There can be no assurance that a borrower or guarantor will comply with its financial covenants or that sufficient assets will be available to pay amounts owed to us under our CRE debt and related guarantees. Â•Our due diligence may not reveal all of a borrower's liabilities and may not reveal other weaknesses in its business. Before making a CRE loan to a borrower, we assess the strength and skills of an entity's management and other factors that we believe are material to the performance of the investment. This underwriting process is particularly important and subjective with respect to newly-organized entities because there may be little or no information publicly available about the entities. In making the assessment and otherwise conducting customary due diligence, we rely on the resources available to us and, in some cases, an investigation by third parties. There can be no assurance that our due diligence processes will uncover all relevant facts or that any investment will be successful. Furthermore, historic performance evaluated in connection with our underwriting process may not be indicative of future performance. Â•In the event of a default or bankruptcy of a borrower, particularly in cases where the borrower has incurred debt that is senior to our CRE debt. If a borrower defaults on our CRE debt and the mortgaged real estate or other borrower assets collateralizing our CRE debt are insufficient to satisfy our CRE debt, we may suffer a loss of principal or interest. In the event of a borrower bankruptcy, we may not have full recourse to the assets of the borrower or the assets of the borrower may not be sufficient to satisfy our CRE debt. In addition, certain of our CRE debt investments are subordinate to other debt of the borrower. If a borrower defaults on our CRE debt or on debt senior to our CRE debt or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our CRE 25 Table of Contents debt will be satisfied only after the senior debt, if any. Bankruptcy and borrower litigation can significantly increase the time needed for us to acquire underlying collateral in the event of a default, during which time the collateral may decline in value. In addition, there are significant monetary costs and delays associated with the foreclosure process. Borrower bankruptcies and litigation relating to our assets have increased appreciably as a result of the recent economic recession, which has required, and continues to require, us to spend significant amounts of money and devote significant senior management resources in order to protect our interests. If the economic markets do not continue to improve, we will continue to experience such costs and delays. Â•In the event provisions of our CRE debt agreements are adjudicated to be unenforceable. Our rights and obligations with respect to our CRE debt investments are governed by loan agreements and related documentation. It is possible that a court could determine that one or more provisions of a loan agreement or related documentation are unenforceable, such as a loan prepayment provision or the provisions protecting our security interest in the underlying collateral. The subordinate debt we originate and invest in may be subject to risks relating to the structure and terms of the related transactions, as well as subordination in bankruptcy, and there may not be sufficient funds or assets remaining to satisfy our investments, which may result in losses to us. We originate, structure and acquire subordinate debt investments secured primarily by commercial properties, including subordinate mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests in borrowers who own such properties. These investments may be subordinate to other debt on commercial property and are secured by subordinate rights to the commercial property or by equity interests in the borrower. If a borrower defaults or declares bankruptcy, after senior obligations are met, there may not be sufficient funds or assets remaining to satisfy our subordinate interests. Because each transaction is privately negotiated, subordinate investments can vary in their structural characteristics and lender rights. Our rights to control the default or bankruptcy process following a default will vary from transaction to transaction. The subordinate investments that we originate and invest in may not give us the right to demand foreclosure as a subordinate real estate debt holder. Furthermore, the presence of intercreditor agreements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers. Similarly, a majority of the participating lenders may be able to take actions to which we object, but by which we will be bound. Even if we have control, we may be unable to prevent a default or bankruptcy and we could suffer substantial losses. Certain transactions that we have originated and invested in could be particularly difficult, time consuming and costly to workout because of their complicated structure and the diverging interests of all the various classes of debt in the capital structure of a given asset. Our control over management for the debt underlying the CSE CDO is governed by contractual agreements with CapitalSource Inc., which may limit our control of certain loans. In certain circumstances under the CSE CDO, we are required to seek approval from CapitalSource, Inc. prior to taking actions with respect to the loans comprising the CSE CDO, which may hinder our ability to enforce the loan or to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or otherwise exercise remedies that we believe are appropriate. We are subject to risks associated with future advance obligations, such as declining real estate values and operating performance. Our CRE debt portfolio may include loans that require us to advance future funds. Future funding obligations subject us to significant risks that the property may have declined in value, projects to be completed with the additional funds may have cost overruns and the borrower may be unable to 26 Table of Contents generate enough cash flow, or sell or refinance the property, in order to repay our CRE loan due. We could determine that we need to fund more money than we originally anticipated in order to maximize the value of our investment even though there is no assurance additional funding would be the best course of action. We invest in CMBS, including subordinate securities, which entails certain risks. We invest in a variety of CMBS, including subordinate securities that are subject to the first risk of loss if any losses are realized on the underlying mortgage loans. CMBS entitle the holders thereof to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flow from a specified pool of commercial or multifamily mortgage loans. Consequently, CMBS will be adversely affected by payment defaults, delinquencies and losses on the underlying CRE loans, which began to increase significantly toward the end of 2008 and are expected to continue into 2012. Furthermore, if the rental and leasing markets do not continue to improve, including by increasing occupancy rates and increasing market rental rates, it could reduce cash flow from the loan pools underlying our CMBS investments. The CMBS market is dependent upon liquidity for refinancing and will be negatively impacted by a lack of such liquidity. Additionally, CMBS is subject to particular risks, including lack of standardized terms and payment of all or substantially all of the principal only at maturity rather than regular amortization of principal. Additional risks may be presented by the type and use of a particular commercial property. Commercial property values and net operating income are subject to volatility, which may result in net operating income becoming insufficient to cover debt service on the related CRE loan. The repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project rather than upon the liquidation value of the underlying real estate. Furthermore, the net operating income from and value of any commercial property are subject to various risks. The exercise of remedies and successful realization of liquidation proceeds relating to CMBS may be highly dependent upon the performance of the servicer or special servicer. Expenses of enforcing the underlying CRE loans (including litigation expenses) and expenses of protecting the properties securing the CRE loans may be substantial. Consequently, in the event of a default or loss on one or more CRE loans contained in a securitization, we may not recover our investment. The CMBS in which we invest are subject to the risks of the mortgage securities market as a whole and risks of the securitization process. The value of CMBS may change due to shifts in the market's perception of issuers and regulatory or tax changes adversely affecting the mortgage securities market as a whole. Due to our investment in subordinate CMBS, we are also subject to several risks created through the securitization process. Our subordinate CMBS are paid interest only to the extent that there are funds available to make payments after payment of all senior classes. To the extent the collateral pool includes delinquent loans, there is a risk that the interest payment on our subordinate CMBS will not be fully paid, if paid at all. Our subordinate CMBS are also subject to greater credit risk than those CMBS that are more highly rated. Interest shortfalls on our CMBS could have an adverse impact on the cash flow in our security CDOs. Our CMBS are subject to the risk of interest payment shortfalls that may arise from underlying loan defaults, appraisal reductions, special servicer workout fees and realized losses on liquidation of foreclosed properties. As a result of the recent economic crisis and resulting negative effects on the CRE market, certain of the CMBS underlying our CDOs have experienced interest payment shortfalls. We attempt to mitigate these losses by purchasing CMBS with sufficient credit enhancement to avoid such shortfalls. However, there can be no assurance that such interest shortfalls will not continue to persist or increase in the future. 27 Table of Contents We may not control the special servicing of the mortgage loans underlying the CMBS in which we invest and, in such cases, the special servicer may take actions that could adversely affect our interests. Overall control over the special servicing of the underlying mortgage loans of our CMBS may be held by a directing certificate holder that is appointed by the holders of the most subordinate class of such CMBS. We ordinarily do not have the right to appoint the directing certificate holder. In connection with the servicing of the specially serviced loans, the related special servicer may, at the direction of the directing certificate holder, take actions that could adversely affect our interests. The CMBS market was severely impacted by the credit crisis, which had a negative impact on the CMBS that we own. Because the CMBS markets were virtually closed and other participants in the CRE lending market drastically curtailed lending activity during the recent economic recession, real estate owners had difficulty refinancing their assets. Property values also decreased in recent years because of scarcity of financing, which, if available, had terms generally at much lower leverage and higher cost than available in prior years. The U.S. and global markets remain challenged and uncertainty regarding future economic conditions continue to impact CRE values. These conditions, together with widespread downgrades of CMBS by the rating agencies, higher risk premiums required by investors and uncertainty surrounding CRE generally, have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on CMBS and have significantly decreased the value of most of the CMBS that we own from the time we purchased the CMBS, other than, for the most part, CMBS we purchased in 2010 and 2011. Credit ratings assigned to our investments are subject to ongoing evaluations and we cannot assure you that the ratings currently assigned to our investments will not be downgraded. Substantially all of our securities have explicit credit ratings by at least one of the major rating agencies (Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings, Morningstar, DBRS and/or Kroll). The rating agencies have changed their ratings methodologies for all securitized asset classes, including CRE. Their reviews have resulted in, and may continue to result in, large amounts of ratings downgrade actions for CMBS, negatively impacting market values of CMBS and in many cases negatively impacting our CDOs. If rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or reduce, or indicate that they may reduce, their ratings of our investments in the future, the value of these investments could significantly decline, which may negatively impact our ability to comply with the OC test under our CDOs. This could redirect cash distributions to the senior bondholders that would have otherwise been distributed to our CDO retained equity interests, and therefore have an adverse affect on our financial condition. Market conditions resulting from the credit crisis in 2008 and early 2009 have caused and may continue to cause uncertainty in valuing our CRE securities. The market volatility and the lack of liquidity in 2008 and 2009 made the valuation process pertaining to certain of our assets extremely difficult, particularly our CMBS assets for which there was limited market activity. Historically, our estimate of the value of these investments was primarily based on active issuances and the secondary trading market of such securities as compiled and reported by independent pricing agencies. Although the current market environment has improved with some new issuances and increased secondary trading of CMBS compared to 2008 and early 2009, there continues to be uncertainty in the CMBS market. Therefore, our estimate of fair value, which is based on the notion of orderly market transactions, requires significant judgment and consideration of other indicators of value such as current interest rates, relevant market indices, broker quotes, expected cash flows and other relevant market and security-specific data as appropriate. The amount that we could obtain if we were forced to liquidate our securities portfolio into the current market could be materially different than management's best estimate of fair value. 28 Table of Contents Our exchangeable senior notes and our repurchase credit facilities are recourse obligations to us. As of December 31, 2011, $229 million of our exchangeable senior notes were outstanding, of which $20 million is due in June 2012, $36 million is due in June 2013 and $173 million is due March 2016. These amounts are full recourse obligations of our Company. If we are not able to extend, refinance or repurchase these borrowings, we may not have the ability to repay these amounts when they come due. Our inability to repay any of our exchangeable senior notes could cause the acceleration of our borrowings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In 2011, we, through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, obtained two $100 million repurchase credit facilities. In connection with those credit facilities, we executed guaranty agreements with our lender, Wells Fargo, pursuant to which we guaranteed the obligations of the borrowers. Certain events of default under the credit facilities could cause us to become liable to repay the borrowings under the repurchase credit facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our exchangeable senior notes contain cross-default provisions. Our indentures governing our exchangeable senior notes contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement could result in a default and acceleration of borrowings under other agreements. If a cross-default occurred, we may not be able to pay our liabilities or access capital from external sources in order to refinance our borrowings. If some or all of our borrowings default and it causes a default under other borrowings, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our investments in unsecured REIT debt are subject to risks relating to the particular REIT issuer and to the general risks of investing in senior unsecured CRE securities, which may result in losses to us. In addition to general economic and market risks, our investments in unsecured REIT debt involve special risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer. REITs generally are required to substantially invest in real estate or real estate-related assets and are subject to the inherent risks associated with real estate-related investments. Our investments in unsecured REIT debt and other senior unsecured debt are also subject to the risks described above with respect to CRE loans and CMBS and similar risks, including risks of delinquency and foreclosure, the dependence upon the successful operation of, and income from, real property, risks generally related to interests in real property, and risks that may be presented by the type and use of a particular commercial property. REIT debt is generally unsecured and may also be subordinate to other obligations of the issuer. We may also invest in securities that are rated below investment grade. As a result, investments in REIT debt are also subject to risks of: Â•limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; Â•substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates and real estate values; Â•subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the REIT; Â•the operation of mandatory sinking fund or redemption provisions during periods of declining interest rates that could cause the issuer to reinvest redemption proceeds in lower yielding assets; Â•the possibility that earnings of the REIT may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; 29 Table of Contents Â•the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates, declining real estate values and economic downturns; Â•rating agency credit rating downgrades negatively impacting value of securities; and Â•covenants not being sufficient to protect investors from the adverse credit impact of merger and acquisition transactions and increased leverage of the REIT. These risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding REIT debt we hold and the ability of the issuers thereof to repay principal and interest or make distributions. Investments in net lease properties may generate losses. The value of our investments and the income from our net lease properties may be significantly adversely affected by a number of factors, including: Â•national, state and local economic conditions; Â•real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for real estate space in an area; Â•the perceptions of tenants or operators and prospective tenants or operators of the quality, convenience, attractiveness and safety of our properties; Â•competition from comparable properties; Â•the occupancy rate of, and the rental rates charged at, our properties; Â•the ability to collect on a timely basis all rent from tenants or operators; Â•the effects of any bankruptcies or insolvencies of tenants or operators; Â•the expense of re-leasing space; Â•changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of mortgage financing; Â•the ability to refinance debt related to our net lease properties on favorable terms, if at all; Â•the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; Â•cost of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA; Â•adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; Â•civil unrest; Â•acts of nature, including earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters (which may result in uninsured losses); Â•adverse changes in zoning laws; and Â•other factors which are beyond our control. We may obtain only limited warranties when we purchase a property, which will increase the risk that we may lose some or all of our invested capital in the property or rental income from the property which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results from operations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. The seller of a property often sells such property in an "as is" condition on a "where is" basis and "with all faults," without any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. In addition, the related real estate purchase and sale agreements may contain only limited warranties, 30 Table of Contents representations and indemnifications that will only survive for a limited period after the closing. The purchase of properties with limited warranties increases the risk that we may lose some or all of our invested capital in the property, as well as the loss of rental income from that property if an issue should arise that decreases the value of that property and is not covered by the limited warranties. If any of these results occur, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. Our investments in net lease properties and a substantial portion of our healthcare net lease properties are dependent upon tenants or operators successfully operating their businesses and their failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We depend on our tenants or operators to manage the day-to-day operations of our net lease properties and our healthcare facilities in a manner that generates revenues sufficient to allow them to meet their obligations to us, including their obligations to pay rent, maintain certain insurance coverage, pay real estate taxes and maintain the facilities under their operational control in a manner that does not jeopardize their operating licenses or regulatory status. The ability of our tenants or operators to fulfill their obligations to us may depend, in part, upon the overall profitability of their operations, including any other facilities, properties or businesses they may acquire or operate. The cash flow generated by the operation of our facilities may not be sufficient for a tenant or operator to meet its obligations to us. Our financial position could be weakened and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our net lease borrowings could be limited if our tenants or operators are unable to meet their obligations to us or we fail to renew or extend our contractual relationship with any of our tenants or operators. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We are subject to risks associated with obtaining mortgage financing on our net lease properties, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2011, our net lease property portfolio had total borrowings of $555 million. Financing for new investments and our maturing borrowings for our net lease property portfolio may be provided by credit facilities, private or public debt offerings, assumption of secured borrowings, mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures. We are subject to risks normally associated with financing, including the risks that our cash flow will be insufficient to make timely payments of interest or principal, that we will be unable to refinance existing borrowings or support collateral obligations and that the terms of refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing borrowing. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions or the sale of the underlying property, our cash flow may not be sufficient in all years to pay distributions to our stockholders and to repay all maturing borrowings. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, the interest expense relating to that refinanced borrowing would increase, which could reduce our profitability and the amount of distributions we are able to pay. Moreover, additional financing increases the amount of our leverage, which could negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future or make us more vulnerable in a downturn in our results of operations or the economy generally. The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of any of our tenants or operators could significantly delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new tenants or operators. Our financial position and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by any of our major operators, including bankruptcy, 31 Table of Contents insolvency or a general downturn in the business, or in the event any of our major tenants or operators do not renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire. We are exposed to the risk that our tenants or operators may not be able to meet their obligations to us or other third parties, which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency. Although our leases and loans permit us to evict a tenant or operator, demand immediate repayment and pursue other remedies, the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant or operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rents or interest during the bankruptcy proceeding. Furthermore, dealing with a tenant's bankruptcy or other default may divert management's attention and cause us to incur substantial legal and other costs. Bankruptcy laws provide that a debtor has the option to assume or reject an unexpired lease within a certain period of time of filing for bankruptcy, but generally requires such assumption or rejection to be made in its entirety. Thus, a debtor cannot choose to keep the beneficial provisions of a contract while rejecting the burdensome ones; the contract must be assumed or rejected as a whole. Most of our healthcare properties are and will continue to be net leased to an operator operating multiple facilities pursuant to a single master lease. If one or more of our healthcare property operators files for bankruptcy relief, it is possible that in bankruptcy the debtor may be required to assume or reject the master lease in its entirety, rather than making the decision on a property-by-property basis, thereby preventing the debtor from assuming the better performing properties and terminating the master lease with respect to the poorer performing properties. However, where under applicable law a contract (even though it is contained in a single document) is determined to be divisible or severable into different agreements, or similarly, where a collection of documents is determined to constitute separate agreements instead of a single, integrated contract, then in those circumstances a debtor/trustee may be allowed to assume some of the divisible or separate agreements while rejecting the others. If the debtor has the ability, and chooses, to assume some of the divisible agreement while rejecting the other divisible agreements, or if a non-debtor tenant is unable to comply with the terms of an agreement, we may be forced to modify the agreements in ways that are unfavorable to us. Because real estate investments and our REO are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell properties in our portfolio is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and supply and demand. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Additionally, our healthcare properties are special purpose properties that could not be readily converted to general residential, retail or office use. Transfers of operations of healthcare properties are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and real estate. To the extent we are unable to sell any property for its book value or at all, we may be required to take a non-cash impairment charge or loss on the sale, either of which would reduce our earnings. We may be required to expend cash to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have cash available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. We may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of financing that can be placed or repaid on that property. These transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate. These facts and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties may have 32 Table of Contents a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders. We may not be able to relet or renew leases at the properties held by us on terms favorable to us. Our net lease assets have been negatively impacted as a result of the recent economic conditions and will continue to be pressured if economic conditions and rental markets do not continue to show improvement. For example, upon expiration or earlier termination of leases for space located at our properties, the space may not be relet or, if relet, the terms of the renewal or reletting (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants or operators) may be less favorable than current lease terms. Poor economic conditions would likely reduce tenants' or operators' ability to make rent payments in accordance with the contractual terms of their leases and lead to early termination of leases. Furthermore, corporate space needs may contract, resulting in lower lease renewal rates and longer releasing periods when leases are not renewed. Any of these situations may result in extended periods where there is a significant decline in revenues or no revenues generated by a property. Additionally, to the extent that market rental rates are reduced, property-level cash flows would likely be negatively affected as existing leases renew at lower rates. If we are unable to relet or renew leases for all or substantially all of the space at these properties, if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected, or if our reserves for these purposes prove inadequate, we will experience a reduction in net income and may be required to reduce or eliminate cash distributions to our stockholders. We may become responsible for capital improvements. To the extent such capital improvements are not undertaken, the ability of our tenants or operators to manage our facilities effectively and on favorable terms may be affected, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Although under our typical triple net lease structure our tenants or operators are generally responsible for capital improvement expenditures, it is possible that a tenant or operator may not be able to fulfill its obligations to keep the facility in good operating condition. To the extent capital improvements are not undertaken or are deferred, occupancy rates and the amount of rental and reimbursement income generated by the facility may decline, which would negatively impact the overall value of the affected facility. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Fair Housing Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us, our borrowers or our tenants and operators to make unanticipated expenditures which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our facilities and properties are required to comply with the ADA, which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. We must also comply with the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits us and our tenants or operators from discriminating against individuals on certain bases in any of our practices if it would cause such individuals to face barriers in gaining residency in any of our facilities. In addition, our facilities and properties are required to operate in compliance with applicable fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations and licensing or certification requirements as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies from time-to-time. We may be required to make substantial expenditures to comply with those requirements. Changes in labor laws could also impact us, our borrowers and our tenants or operators. The Employee Free Choice Act, or EFCA, was previously considered by the U.S. Congress. EFCA, also referred to as the "card check" bill, if passed as previously proposed or in similar form, or changes to other labor- 33 Table of Contents related statutes or regulations could significantly impact the cost of labor in the workforce, which would increase the costs faced by our borrowers and tenants or operators. Lease defaults, terminations or landlord-tenant/operator disputes may adversely reduce our income from our net lease property portfolio. The creditworthiness of our tenants or operators in our net lease property investments may have been, or could become, negatively impacted as a result of the challenging economic conditions or otherwise, which could result in their inability to meet the terms of their leases. Lease defaults or terminations by one or more tenants or operators may reduce our revenues unless a default is cured or a suitable replacement tenant or operator is found promptly. In addition, disputes may arise between the landlord and tenant or operator that result in the tenant or operator withholding rent payments, possibly for an extended period. These disputes may lead to litigation or other legal procedures to secure payment of the rent withheld or to evict the tenant or operator. Any of these situations may result in extended periods during which there is a significant decline in revenues or no revenues generated by a property. If this occurred, it could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, two of our healthcare operators account for 29% of our total rental and escalation income and while no tenant currently accounts for in excess of 10% of our rental and escalation income, failure or inability of a tenant or operator contributing to a significant percentage of our contractual rental revenue to meet its obligations to us could materially reduce our rental revenue and net income, which could in turn reduce the amount of distributions we pay and cause our stock price to decline. A significant portion of our leases may expire in the same year. A significant portion of the leases that we have entered may expire in the same year, which may coincide with the maturities on the borrowing for the properties subject to such leases. As a result, we could be subject to a sudden and material change in value of our net lease and/or our healthcare portfolio and available cash flow from our net lease and/or our healthcare investments in the event that these leases are not renewed or in the event that we are not able to extend or refinance the loans on the properties that are subject to these leases. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our properties or our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of our investments. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, such as us and our tenants or operators, may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of, or related releases of, certain hazardous or toxic substances, including materials containing asbestos, at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances and liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of a tenant or operator at the property. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our or our tenants' or operators' ability to sell or lease real estate, or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. We, or our tenants or operators, as owner or operator of a site, may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site. The cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and our or our tenants' or operators' liability could exceed the value of the property. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the 34 Table of Contents failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect our or our tenants' or operators' ability to attract additional residents, ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. The scope of the indemnifications our tenants or operators have agreed to provide us may be limited. For instance, some of our agreements with our tenants or operators do not require them to indemnify us for environmental liabilities arising before the tenant or operator took possession of the premises. Further, we cannot assure you that any such tenant or operator would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations. If we were deemed liable for any such environmental liabilities and were unable to seek recovery against our tenant or operator, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may invest in real estate, or mortgage loans secured by real estate, with environmental problems that materially impair the value of the real estate. Even as a lender, if we foreclose upon a property with environmental problems or if other circumstances arise, we could be subject to environmental liability. There are substantial risks associated with such an investment. Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our, or our tenants' or operators' insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flows. Although we believe our net lease property investments, including our healthcare properties, and properties collateralizing our CRE loan and security investments are adequately covered by insurance, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, including terrorism or acts of war, also might make the insurance proceeds insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the affected real property. Any uninsured loss could result in both loss of cash flow from, and the asset value of, the affected property. In addition, the CRE loans secured by certain of our properties contain customary covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain property insurance in an amount equal to the replacement cost of the properties, which may increase the cost of obtaining the required insurance. We are named as a defendant in a lawsuit and the adverse resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. One of our net lease investments was comprised of three office buildings totaling 257,000 square feet located in Chatsworth, California and was 100% leased to Washington Mutual Bank, FA, or WaMu. The tenant vacated the buildings as of March 23, 2009 and the leases, or the WaMu Leases, were disaffirmed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. In the third quarter 2009, the lender, GECCMC 2005-CI Plummer Office Limited Partnership, or GECCMC, foreclosed on the property. On August 10, 2009, GECCMC filed a complaint against NRFC NNN Holdings, Inc., or NNN, and NRFC Sub Investor IV, LLC, or NRFC Sub Investor IV, which are our wholly-owned subsidiaries, in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. In the complaint, GECCMC alleged, among other things, that the loan provided by GECCMC to NRFC Sub Investor IV was a recourse obligation of NNN due to the FDIC's disaffirmance of the WaMu Leases. The judge presiding over the lawsuit has entered a judgment against NNN in the amount of approximately $46 million plus costs, attorneys' fees and prejudgment interests. NNN has posted an appeal bond, which is currently collateralized by $26 million of cash, and is in the process of vigorously appealing the decision. An adverse result on appeal could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. 35 Table of Contents Many of our investments are illiquid, and we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to further changes in economic and other conditions, which may result in losses to us. Many of our investments are illiquid. As a result, our ability to sell properties, securities or CRE debt in response to changes in economic and other conditions could be limited, except at distressed prices. The Internal Revenue Code also places limits on our ability to sell certain properties held for fewer than two years. These considerations could make it difficult for us to dispose of any of our assets even if a disposition was in the best interests of our stockholders. As a result, our ability to vary our portfolio in response to further changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which may result in losses to us. We may make investments in assets with lower credit quality, which will increase our risk of losses. Most of our securities have explicit ratings assigned by at least one of the three leading nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies. However, we may invest in unrated securities, enter into net leases with unrated tenants or operators or participate in unrated or distressed mortgage loans. Because the ability of obligors of net lease properties and mortgages, including mortgage loans underlying CMBS, to make rent or principal and interest payments may be impaired during an economic downtown, as we recently experienced, prices of lower credit quality investments and securities may decline. The existing credit support in the securitization structure may be insufficient to protect us against loss of our principal on these investments and securities. We have not established and do not currently plan to establish any investment criteria to limit our exposure to these risks for future investments. We have no established investment criteria limiting the geographic concentration of our investments in CRE debt, CRE securities or net lease properties. If our investments are concentrated in an area that experiences adverse economic conditions, our investments may lose value and we may experience losses. Certain CRE debt and securities in which we invest may be secured by a single property or properties in one geographic location. Additionally, net lease properties that we may acquire may also be located in a geographic cluster. These current and future investments carry the risks associated with significant geographical concentration. We have not established and do not plan to establish any investment criteria to limit our exposure to these risks for future investments. As a result, properties underlying our investments may be overly concentrated in certain geographic areas, and we may experience losses as a result. A worsening of economic conditions in the geographic area in which our investments may be concentrated could have an adverse effect on our business, including reducing the demand for new financings, limiting the ability of borrowers to pay financed amounts and impairing the value of our collateral. Our portfolio is highly leveraged, which may adversely affect our return on our investments and may reduce cash available for distribution. We leverage our portfolio generally through the use of credit facilities, mortgage notes, securitizations, including the CDOs and other borrowings. The type and percentage of financing varies depending on our ability to obtain credit and the lender's estimate of the stability of the portfolio's cash flow. However, we do not restrict the amount of borrowings that we may incur. High leverage can, particularly during difficult economic times, increase our risk of loss and harm our liquidity. Moreover, we may have to incur more recourse borrowings in order to obtain financing for our business. 36 Table of Contents We utilize short-term borrowings to finance our CRE debt and security investments, which may expose us to increased risks associated with decreases in the fair value of the underlying collateral and which could cause an adverse impact on our results of operations. Short-term borrowing through repurchase agreements, credit facilities and other borrowings may put our assets and financial condition at risk. In 2011, we, through two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, obtained two $100 million repurchase credit facilities. Repurchase agreements economically resemble short-term, floating-rate financing and our repurchase credit facilities require the maintenance of specific loan-to-collateral value ratios. If the fair value of the assets subject to our repurchase credit facilities decline, we may be required to provide additional collateral or make cash payments to maintain the loan-to-collateral value ratio. If we are unable to provide such collateral or cash repayments, we may lose our economic interest in the underlying assets. Further, such borrowings may require us to maintain a certain amount of cash reserves or to set aside unleveraged assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position that would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. Our repurchase credit facilities provide for an unrestricted cash covenant of $45 million. In addition, such short-term borrowing facilities may limit the length of time that any given asset may be used as eligible collateral. As a result, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our income generated on such assets. In the event that we are unable to meet the collateral obligations in our short-term financing arrangements, our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly. Our joint venture partners could take actions that decrease the value of an investment to us and lower our overall return. We currently have and may in the future enter into joint ventures with third parties to make investments. We may also make investments in partnerships or other co-ownership arrangements or participations. Such investments may involve risks not otherwise present with other methods of investment, including, for example, the following risks: Â•that our co-venturer or partner in an investment could become insolvent or bankrupt; Â•that such co-venturer or partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals that are or that become in conflict with our business interests or goals; or Â•that such co-venturer or partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Any of the above might subject us to liabilities and thus reduce our returns on our investment with that co-venturer or partner. We are subject to risks associated with owning residential land investments, including in connection with our LandCap joint venture. We are subject to risks associated with owning residential land, for example, in late 2007, we entered into a joint venture with Whitehall Street Global Real Estate Limited Partnership 2007, or Whitehall, to form LandCap Partners and LandCap LoanCo., which we collectively refer to as LandCap. LandCap was established to opportunistically invest in single-family residential land through land loans, lot option agreements and select land purchases. The joint venture is currently managed by a third-party management group which has extensive experience in the single family housing sector. These investments like other residential land investments, are expected to generate very little current cash flow and to be held for several years prior to liquidation. We and Whitehall agreed to provide no additional new investment capital in the LandCap joint venture. The venture will continue to manage existing investments and we do not expect the venture to return capital to us for several years. 37 Table of Contents Interest rate fluctuations may reduce the spread we earn on our interest-earning investments and may reduce our earnings. Although we seek to match-fund our assets and mitigate the risk associated with future interest rate volatility, we are primarily subject to interest rate risk because we do not hedge our retained equity interest in our floating-rate CDOs. If a CDO has floating-rate assets, our earnings will generally increase with increases in floating rates to the extent such increases do not cause distress for borrowers and our underlying assets are able to provide sufficient cash to pay such higher rates. Conversely, our earnings will generally decrease with declines in floating rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. Our interest rate risk sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative positions are generally held for non-trading purposes. As of December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to our variable rate assets would increase our annual interest income by approximately $26 million offset by an increase in our interest expense of approximately $22 million on our variable rate liabilities. Similarly, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would impact our annual interest income and expense by the same net amount. While we seek to align the maturities of our liabilities with the maturities on our assets, we may not be successful in that regard which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Our general financing strategy has focused on the use of "match-funded" structures. This means that we seek to align the maturities of our liabilities with the maturities on our assets in order to manage the risks of being forced to refinance our liabilities prior to the maturities of our assets. In addition, we match interest rates on our assets with like-kind borrowings, so fixed-rate assets are financed with fixed-rate borrowings and floating-rate assets are financed with floating-rate borrowings, directly or indirectly through the use of interest rate swaps, caps and other financial instruments or through a combination of these strategies. We may fail to appropriately employ match-funded structures on favorable terms, or at all. We may also determine not to pursue a match-funded structure with respect to a portion of our financings for a variety of reasons. If we fail to appropriately employ match-funded structures, our exposure to interest rate volatility and exposure to matching liabilities prior to the maturity of the corresponding asset may increase substantially which could harm our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. Our hedging transactions may limit our gains and could result in losses. To limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations, we may employ hedging strategies, including engaging in interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate contracts as well as engaging in short sales of securities or of future contracts. The use of these types of derivatives to hedge our assets and liabilities carries certain risks, including the risks that: Â•losses on a hedge position will reduce the cash available for distribution to stockholders; Â•losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments; Â•a hedge may not perform its intended use of offsetting losses on an investment; Â•the counterparties with which we trade may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments, which may render us unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position; and Â•the counterparties with which we trade may experience business failures, which would most likely result in a default. Default by such counterparty may result in the loss of unrealized profits, which were expected to offset losses on our assets. Such defaults may also result in a loss of 38 Table of Contents income on swaps or caps, which income was expected to be available to cover our debt service payments. Our results of operations may be adversely affected during any period as a result of the use of derivatives. If we anticipate that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for REIT income test purposes, we may conduct some or all of our hedging activities through a corporate subsidiary that would be subject to corporate level taxation. We may change our investment strategy without stockholder consent and make riskier investments. We may change our investment strategy at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are different from and possibly riskier than, the investments described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A change in our investment strategy may increase our exposure to interest rate and real estate market fluctuations. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to significant competition, and we may not be able to compete successfully for investments. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other real estate investors, some of which have greater financial resources than us, including publicly-traded REITs, private REITs, investment banking firms, private institutional funds, hedge funds and private equity funds. We may not be able to compete successfully for investments. We are subject to substantial regulation, numerous contractual obligations and extensive internal policies and failure to comply with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We and our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation, numerous contractual obligations and extensive internal policies. Given our lines of business and organizational structure, we are subject to regulation by the SEC, NYSE, FINRA, the internal revenue service, or IRS, and other federal, state and local governmental bodies and agencies. These regulations are extensive, complex and require substantial management time and attention. If we fail to comply with any of the regulations that apply to our business, we could be subjected to substantial penalties and our business and operations could be materially adversely affected. We also have numerous contractual obligations that we must adhere to on a continuous basis to operate our business, the default of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have also established internal policies designed to ensure that we manage our business in accordance with applicable law and regulation and in accordance with our contractual obligations. While we have designed policies to appropriately operate our business, these policies may not be effective in all regards and, further, if we fail to comply with our internal policies, we could be subjected to additional risk and liability. We act as a servicer and special servicer with respect to our CRE debt and security investments and certain of the mortgage loans underlying the CMBS in which we invest and we may make decisions that subject us to loss and expose us to liability from third parties. We act as a servicer and special servicer with respect to our CRE debt and security investments and certain of the mortgage loans underlying the CMBS in which we invest. When acting in that capacity, we are responsible for servicing the subject assets in accordance with applicable industry standards, laws, regulations and contractual obligations. As a servicer or special servicer, we are responsible for critical functions that can have a significant effect on the value of the underlying assets. If we fail to adhere to applicable industry standards, laws, regulations or contractual obligations, or if we make decisions that are not effective, we could suffer significant losses and expose ourselves to substantial liability from third parties who were relying on our servicing function. 39 Table of Contents Risks Related to Investments in Healthcare Assets The healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect it to become more competitive. We own and manage a portfolio of healthcare net lease properties, with a focus on the senior housing sector. A majority of our assets are assisted living, skilled nursing and independent living facilities. In addition, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 for Senior Care, a non-listed REIT formed to originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of debt and equity investments in the healthcare property sector. We expect that if the registration statement on Form S-11 for Senior Care is declared effective by the SEC and we successfully raise capital for that company, which may not be the case, it would also be managed by us through a subsidiary and we would earn management and other fees for our services. The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future. The operators of the facilities we own or lend to compete with numerous other companies that provide long-term care alternatives such as home healthcare agencies, life care at home, facility-based service programs, retirement communities, convalescent centers and other independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing providers, including not-for-profit entities. In general, regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the assisted living and independent living segments of the healthcare industry are not substantial, although there are generally barriers to the development of skilled nursing facilities. Consequently, our operators may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to attract new residents, raise resident fees or expand their businesses, which could adversely adverse effect our revenues and earnings. Our failure or the failure of our operators to comply with licensing and certification requirements, the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, fraud and abuse regulations or new legislative developments may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We or our operators, as the case may be, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing laws. The ultimate timing or effect of any changes in these laws and regulations cannot be predicted. With respect to our healthcare facilities held and operated through net lease transaction structures, we have no direct control over our operators' ability to meet the numerous federal, state and local regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these laws, requirements and regulations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In particular: Â•Licensing and Certification. We, our operators and our healthcare facilities are subject to regulatory and licensing requirements of federal, state and local authorities and are periodically surveyed by them to confirm compliance. Failure to obtain licensure or loss or suspension of licensure or certification may prevent a facility from operating or result in a suspension of reimbursement payments until all licensure or certification issues have been resolved and the necessary licenses or certification are obtained or reinstated. Our healthcare facilities may require governmental approval in the form of a certificate of need that generally varies by state and is subject to change, prior to the addition of new beds, the addition of service or certain capital expenditures. Facilities may also be affected by changes in accreditation standards or procedures of accrediting agencies that are recognized by governments in the certification process. State licensing laws require operators of healthcare facilities to comply with extensive standards governing operations. State agencies administering those laws regularly inspect such facilities and investigate complaints. Failure to meet all regulatory requirements could result in the loss of the ability to provide or bill and receive payment for healthcare services. In such 40 Table of Contents event, revenues from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time or permanently. Transfers of operations of healthcare facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and real estate. Â•Medicare and Medicaid. Generally, a portion of the revenue from the operation of our healthcare facilities and other healthcare properties (and a significant portion of the revenue in the case of a skilled nursing facility) is derived from governmentally-funded reimbursement programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, and failure to maintain enrollment and participation in these programs would result in a loss of funding from such programs. Moreover, federal and state governments have adopted and continue to consider various reform proposals to control healthcare costs. In recent years, there have been fundamental changes in the Medicare program that have resulted in reduced levels of payment for a substantial portion of healthcare services. In many instances, revenues from Medicaid programs are already insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to patients. In addition, reimbursement from private payors has in many cases effectively been reduced to levels approaching those of government payors. Governmental concern regarding healthcare costs and their budgetary impact and the specter of fraud and abuse in claims reimbursement may result in significant reductions in payments to our operators, and future reimbursement rates for either governmental or private payors may not be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients. Exclusion, debarment, suspension or other ineligibility to participate in federal healthcare programs or any changes in reimbursement policies that reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care could cause our or our operators revenue and the value of the affected healthcare properties to decline. Â•Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations. There are complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals, financial relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers, including criminal provisions that prohibit financial inducements for referrals, filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under Medicare and Medicaid, or failing to refund overpayments or improper payments. Governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti-fraud initiatives against healthcare providers. The Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has announced a number of new and ongoing initiatives to study instances of potential Medicare and Medicaid overbilling and/or fraud. Violations of these laws subject persons and entities to termination from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded healthcare programs. In addition, the federal False Claims Act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government's recovery. Because of these incentives, these so-called "whistleblower" suits have become more frequent. The violation of any of these laws or regulations by us or by any of our operators may result in the imposition of significant monetary damages, fines and other penalties. Â•Other Laws. Other laws that impact how we and our operators conduct business include: federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of patient health information; state and local licensure laws; laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices; laws generally affecting the management of our healthcare facilities and other healthcare properties and equipment and how our operators generally conduct their operations, such as fire, health and safety, and environmental laws; federal and state laws affecting healthcare facilities mandating quality of services and care, and quality of food service; resident rights (including abuse and neglect laws); and health standards set by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Â•Legislative and Regulatory Developments. Legislative proposals are often introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures that would effect changes in the healthcare system. 41 Table of Contents The healthcare industry is heavily regulated. New laws or regulations such as the healthcare reform law and related regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of our operators to make rent payments to us. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated by federal, state and local governmental bodies. Healthcare facility operators generally are subject to laws and regulations covering, among other things, licensure, certification for participation in government programs, and relationships with physicians and other referral sources. Changes in these laws and regulations could negatively affect the ability of our operators to make lease payments to us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Many of our targeted properties and their operators may require a license or certificate of need, or CON, to operate. Failure to obtain a license or CON, or loss of a required license or CON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operator. These events could materially adversely affect our operators' ability to make rent payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction of healthcare-related facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval. State CON laws are not uniform throughout the U.S. and are subject to change. We cannot predict the impact of state CON laws on our development of facilities or the operations of our operators. In addition, state CON laws often materially impact the ability of competitors to enter into the marketplace of our facilities. The repeal of CON laws could allow competitors to freely operate in previously closed markets. This could negatively affect our operators' abilities to make rent payments to us. In limited circumstances, loss of state licensure or certification or closure of a facility could ultimately result in loss of authority to operate the facility and require new CON authorization to re-institute operations. As a result, a portion of the value of the facility may be reduced, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Recently enacted comprehensive healthcare reform legislation could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to stockholders. On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or PPACA, and on March 30, 2010, the President signed into law the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Reconciliation Act, which in part modified PPACA. Together, the two laws serve as the primary vehicle for comprehensive healthcare reform in the U.S. and will become effective through a phased approach, which began in 2010 and will conclude in 2018. The laws are intended to reduce the number of individuals in the U.S. without health insurance and significantly change the means by which healthcare is organized, delivered and reimbursed. PPACA includes program integrity provisions that both create new authorities and expand existing authorities for federal and state governments to address fraud, waste and abuse in federal health programs. In addition, PPACA expands reporting requirements and responsibilities related to facility ownership and management, patient safety and care quality. In the ordinary course of their businesses, our operators may be regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. If they do not comply with the additional reporting requirements and responsibilities, our operators' ability to participate in federal health programs may be adversely affected. Moreover, there may be other aspects of the comprehensive healthcare reform legislation for which regulations have not yet been adopted, which, depending on how they are implemented, could materially and adversely affect our operators, and therefore our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to you. These laws have been the subject of multiple constitutional challenges and the U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled hearings in March 2012 to review the constitutionality of PPACA and its requirement for an individual to purchase health insurance, 42 Table of Contents thereby creating uncertainty about whether such laws will remain in effect with respect to that aspect of the laws or at all. State law may limit the availability of certain types of healthcare facilities for our acquisition or development and may limit our ability to replace obsolete properties. Certificate of Need laws may impose investment barriers for us. Some states regulate the supply of some types of healthcare facilities, such as skilled nursing facilities or assisted living facilities, through CON laws. A CON typically is a written statement issued by a state regulatory agency evidencing a community's need for a new, converted, expanded or otherwise significantly modified healthcare facility or service which is regulated pursuant to the state's statutes. These restrictions may create barriers to entry or expansion and may limit the availability of properties for our acquisition or development. In addition, we may invest in properties which cannot be replaced if they become obsolete unless such replacement is approved or exempt under a CON law. Our operators are faced with increased litigation and rising insurance costs that may affect their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments. In some states, advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities, and these groups have brought litigation against operators. Also, in several instances, private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs incurred by our operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition, the cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting the operations of healthcare facilities continues. Continued cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments, potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and litigation costs. Moreover, to the extent we are required to take back the affected facilities, our revenue from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time. Economic downturns, weakness in the housing and equity markets, lowered consumer confidence and other events could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford the entrance fees or monthly resident fees for our healthcare facilities and, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Costs to seniors associated with independent and assisted living services are generally not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our facilities are located typically will be able to afford to pay our entrance fees and monthly resident fees. Economic downturns, softness in the housing market, lower levels of consumer confidence, reductions or declining growth of government entitlement programs (such as social security benefits), stock market volatility, changes in demographics and other events could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford the entrance fees or monthly resident fees for our healthcare facilities. If our operators are unable to retain and attract seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services and other services provided by our operators at our healthcare facilities, our occupancy rates could decline, which could, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 43 Table of Contents The inability of seniors to sell real estate may delay their moving into our facilities which could materially adversely affect our occupancy rates and our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Housing price declines and reductions in residential mortgage availability have negatively affected the U.S. housing market, with certain geographic areas experiencing more acute deterioration than others. Downturns in the U.S. housing market could adversely affect the ability (or perceived ability) of seniors to afford entrance fees and monthly resident fees at our healthcare facilities, as potential residents frequently use the proceeds from the sale of their homes to cover the costs of these fees. Specifically, if seniors have a difficult time selling their homes, these difficulties could impact their ability to relocate into our facilities or finance their stays at our facilities. This could cause the amount of our revenues generated by private payment sources to decline. If the recent volatility in the U.S. housing market continues for a protracted period, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Government budget deficits could lead to a reduction in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement. The slowdown in the U.S. economy has negatively affected state budgets, which may put pressure on states to decrease reimbursement rates with the goal of decreasing state expenditures under state Medicaid programs. The need to control Medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in state Medicaid programs due to unemployment, declines in family incomes and eligibility expansions required by the recently enacted PPACA. These potential reductions could be compounded by the potential for federal cost-cutting efforts that could lead to reductions in reimbursement rates under the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and other healthcare related programs. Potential reductions in reimbursements under these programs could negatively impact the ability of our operators and their ability to meet their obligations to us. Possible changes in the acuity profile of our residents as well as payor mix and payment methodologies may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. The sources and amounts of our revenues from our healthcare property portfolio are determined by a number of factors, including licensed bed capacity, occupancy, the acuity profile of residents and the rate of reimbursement. Changes in the acuity profile of the residents as well as payor mix among private pay, Medicare and Medicaid may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Because of the unique and specific improvements required for healthcare properties, we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our properties suitable for other operators, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. Healthcare properties are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. The improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use, such as upgrading electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure, are costly and often times operator-specific. A new or replacement operator may require different features in a property, depending on that operator's particular operations. If a current operator is unable to pay rent and vacates a property, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property for a new operator, or for multiple operators with varying infrastructure requirements, before we are able to release the space. Consequently, our healthcare properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office or other operators without significant expenditures or renovations, which costs may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 44 Table of Contents If our operators fail to cultivate new or maintain existing relationships with residents in the markets in which they operate, our operators' occupancy percentage, payor mix and resident rates may deteriorate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. The ability of our operators to improve the overall occupancy percentage, payor mix and resident rates at our healthcare facilities, depends on our operators' reputation in the communities they serve and our operators' ability to successfully market our facilities to potential residents. A large part of our operators' marketing and sales effort is directed towards cultivating and maintaining relationships with key community organizations that work with seniors, physicians and other healthcare providers in the communities where our facilities are located, whose referral practices significantly affect the choices seniors make with respect to their long-term care needs. If our operators are unable to successfully cultivate and maintain strong relationships with these community organizations, physicians and other healthcare providers, occupancy rates at our facilities could decline, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We may not be able to compete effectively in those markets where overbuilding exists and our inability to compete in those markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Overbuilding in the healthcare segment in the late 1990s reduced occupancy and revenue rates at healthcare facilities. This, combined with unsustainable levels of borrowings, forced several operators into bankruptcy. The occurrence of another period of overbuilding could adversely affect our future occupancy and resident fee rates, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our operators may be subject to significant legal actions that could subject them to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. Our operators may be subject to claims that their services have resulted in resident injury or other adverse effects. The insurance coverage maintained by our operators, whether through commercial insurance or self-insurance, may not cover all claims made against them or continue to be available at a reasonable cost, if at all. In some states, insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and litigation may not, in certain cases, be available to our operators due to state law prohibitions or limitations of availability. As a result, our operators operating in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered or are in excess of their insurance policy limits. From time-to-time, there may also be increases in government investigations of long-term care providers, particularly in the area of Medicare/Medicaid false claims and resident care, as well as increases in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations. Insurance is not available to cover such losses. Any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or government investigation, whether currently asserted or arising in the future, could lead to potential termination from government programs, large penalties and fines and otherwise have a material adverse effect on a healthcare operator's financial condition. If a healthcare operator is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage, if judgments are obtained in excess of the insurance coverage, if a healthcare operator is required to pay uninsured punitive damages, or if a healthcare operator is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action, the healthcare operator could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities, which could result in its bankruptcy or insolvency or have a material adverse effect on the healthcare operator's business and its ability to meet its obligations to us. Moreover, advocacy groups that monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities have sued healthcare facility operators and called upon state and federal legislators to enhance their oversight of trends in healthcare facility ownership and quality of care. In response, the recently enacted PPACA 45 Table of Contents imposes additional reporting requirements and responsibilities for healthcare facility operators. Patients have also sued healthcare facility operators and have, in certain cases, succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses. This litigation and potential future litigation has materially increased the costs incurred by our operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition, the cost of medical malpractice and liability insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting the operations of healthcare facilities continues. Compliance with the requirements in PPACA could increase costs as well. Increased costs could limit our operators' ability to meet their obligations to us, potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and litigation costs. To the extent we are required to remove or replace an operator, our revenue from the affected property could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time. Delays in our operators' collection of their accounts receivable could adversely affect their cash flows and financial condition and their ability to meet their obligations to us. Prompt billing and collection are important factors in the liquidity of our operators. Billing and collection of accounts receivable are subject to the complex regulations that govern Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and rules imposed by non-government payors. The inability of our operators to bill and collect on a timely basis pursuant to these regulations and rules could subject them to payment delays that could negatively impact their cash flows and ultimately their financial condition and their ability to meet their obligations to us. We are facing increasing competition for the acquisition of healthcare properties which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We compete with many other businesses engaged in real estate investment activities for the acquisition of healthcare properties, including local, regional and national operators and acquirers and developers of healthcare real estate. The competition for healthcare properties may significantly increase the price we might pay for a facility or property we seek to acquire and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those facilities or properties themselves. In addition, operators with whom we attempt to do business may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger healthcare REITs may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. This competition may result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them. If we pay higher prices for healthcare properties, our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to the Asset Management Business The organization and management of NSREIT and Senior Care, and any future funds that we raise, may create conflicts of interest. In addition to managing the assets of our CDOs, we sponsor and, through a majority-owned subsidiary, are the advisor of NSREIT, a non-listed REIT that is currently raising capital via a continuous offering. Additionally, we expect to sponsor Senior Care, a non-listed REIT that was formed to originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of debt and equity investments in the healthcare sector. Senior Care has filed a registration statement on Form S-11 and we expect that if it 46 Table of Contents is declared effective by the SEC and we successfully raise capital for that company, which may not be the case, it would also be managed by us through a subsidiary advisor. Our Sponsored REITs, along with any new non-listed REITS or similar type entities we may manage, will acquire assets consistent with their business objectives and that are allocated to them in accordance with our investment allocation policy, which we adopted to ensure that investments are allocated fairly and appropriately among us and our Sponsored REITS. Our investment strategy may be very similar to that of our Sponsored REITs, and therefore many investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for the Sponsored REITs, resulting in potential conflicts of interest, including between investors in these Sponsored REITs and our stockholders, and although we have adopted an investment allocation policy to reduce the conflicts of interest between us and our Sponsored REITs, there is no assurance that we will be successful in eliminating the conflicts arising from the allocation of investment opportunities. We will earn a management and other fees for our services to our Sponsored REITs. Our executives and other real estate and debt finance professionals may face conflicts of interest in allocating their time among NorthStar and our Sponsored REITs. Although as a company we will seek to make these decisions in a manner that we believe is fair and consistent with the operative legal documents governing these investment vehicles, the transfer or allocation of these assets may give rise to investor dissatisfaction or litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest would have a material adverse effect on our reputation which would materially adversely affect our business and our ability to attract investors for future vehicles. Our ability to raise capital and attract investors in our Sponsored REITs is critical to their success. Our Sponsored REITs depend upon our ability to attract purchasers of equity interests, which is highly dependent upon the efforts of the motivated sales force of our subsidiary, NorthStar Realty Securities. NorthStar Realty Securities is a FINRA member wholesale broker-dealer that is registered in the various jurisdictions in which our Sponsored REITs will do business. Our ability to grow our Sponsored REITs will be dependent on our ability to retain and motivate our sales force and other key personnel and to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talent. However, we may not be successful in our efforts to recruit, retain and motivate the required personnel as the market for qualified professionals is extremely competitive. If we do not retain a motivated and effective sales force, or our sales professionals join competitors or form competing companies, it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities and possibly existing investors, which would have a material impact on our Sponsored REITs. There is no assurance NorthStar Realty Securities will be able to enter into third-party selling agreements on behalf of Senior Care or any other new entities we may sponsor or that NorthStar Realty Securities will be able to enter into additional third-party selling agreements on behalf of NSREIT and declines in asset value and reductions in distributions in our Sponsored REITs could cause the loss of such third-party selling agreements and limit our ability to sign future third-party selling agreements. NorthStar Realty Securities has entered into, and we anticipate will enter into additional third-party selling agreements in order to raise capital for our Sponsored REITs. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to enter into additional third-party selling agreements on favorable terms, or at all, which would hinder or even cease our ability to raise capital for our Sponsored REITs. Additionally, significant declines in asset value and reductions in distributions in our Sponsored REITs could cause us to lose third-party selling agreements and limit our ability to sign future third-party selling agreements. 47 Table of Contents Misconduct by third-party selling broker-dealers or our sales force, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on selling broker-dealers and our broker-dealer sales force to properly offer our securities programs to customers in compliance with our selling agreements and with applicable regulatory requirements. While these persons are responsible for their activities as registered broker-dealers, their actions may nonetheless result in complaints or legal or regulatory action against us. Our organization and management of the Sponsored REITs could distract our management and have a negative effect on our business. The organization and management of our Sponsored REITs could divert our management team's attention from our existing business to form and manage the operations and personnel of the Sponsored REITs and implement the business initiatives. Our management team could be required to spend significant time and financial resources on the Sponsored REITs, which could distract and prevent them from furthering our core business activities, regardless of the outcome of the Sponsored REITs. Consequently, this could have a negative effect on our business. Because there are numerous companies seeking to raise capital through non-listed REITs, it may be more difficult for us to do so, particularly as a relatively new sponsor. The number of entrants in the non-listed REIT space has grown significantly over the last couple of years. We have invested significant capital into the organization and management of our Sponsored REITs, and may in the future invest additional capital in other non-listed REIT products. Based on publicly-available information, as of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 45 active non-listed REITs in the marketplace and 18 others have filed registration statements. As a result, we will be subject to significant competition from these and other companies seeking to raise capital in the non-listed REIT space. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and raise capital through our Sponsored REITs or recoup our invested capital. The creation and management of our Sponsored REITs, CDOs and other vehicles could require us to register with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act and subject us to additional regulatory burdens and costs that we are not currently subject. We are not currently required to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Given the changes mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, or Dodd-Frank, many investment advisers that previously relied on the private adviser exemption under the Advisers Act which was repealed by Dodd-Frank, may need to register as an investment adviser with the SEC by March 30, 2012, or seek an exemption from registration. An investment adviser may be required to register with the SEC even if it has a single client, depending on the composition of the client's portfolio and other facts and circumstances. We intend to manage our sponsored vehicles in a manner that does not require registration under the Advisers Act. If we are required to register under the Advisers Act, our business may be negatively affected because we may, among other things, have to devote significant additional management time, may incur significant additional costs and/or may experience a reduction in revenue associated with compliance with the requirements of the Advisers Act. Termination of management arrangements with one or more of our managed entities could harm our business. We provide management services to our existing Sponsored REITs and CDOs, and may provide management services to additional entities in the future. Our management services can be terminated 48 Table of Contents for reasons outside of our control. Upon any such termination, our management fees, after payment of any termination payments required, would cease, thereby reducing our expected revenues. There are risks in using custodians. Our asset management business may depend on the services of custodians to carry out certain transactions. In the event of the insolvency of a custodian, our managed entities might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the custodian's unsecured creditors in relation to assets which the custodian borrows, lends or otherwise uses. In addition, the cash held by our managed entities with a custodian will not be segregated from the custodian's own cash, and such entities will therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto. Our failure to maintain registration as a broker-dealer member in the various jurisdictions in which we will do business and other interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. NorthStar Realty Securities is a FINRA member wholesale broker-dealer that is registered in the various jurisdictions in which our Sponsored REITs do business. NorthStar Realty Securities must comply with various regulatory guidelines to maintain its FINRA membership and continue to operate as a wholesale broker-dealer. There is no guarantee that FINRA, the SEC or the states or territories in which NorthStar Realty Securities is registered will not take action against NorthStar Realty Securities to remove its membership and/or registrations. Even if we have complied with applicable rules, our broker-dealer could still be subjected to investigation and scrutiny that could distract our management, force us to incur substantial cost and harm our brand. If we have failed to comply with applicable rules, we could be subject to enforcement actions and other penalties that could disrupt our business. Accordingly, such events would delay or potentially hinder sales of our Sponsored REITs' securities. Government and self-regulatory organization intervention may limit our ability to continue to implement certain strategies or manage certain risks. Government and self-regulatory organizations have significant influence over the regulatory framework under which our Company operates. In the past, these organizations have also undertaken significant measures to influence market forces. For example, in order to address pervasive and fundamental disruptions in the global financial markets, the government adopted numerous measures, including the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, in October 2008, giving the U.S. Treasury Secretary the authority to use up to $700 billion to, among other things, inject capital into financial institutions and establish a program to purchase from financial institutions residential or CRE loans and other securities in November 2008, which allowed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to provide non-recourse loans to borrowers to fund their purchase of eligible assets, which initially included asset-backed securities but was later expanded to include CMBS and non-agency residential mortgage-based securities, and, more recently, Dodd-Frank, which outlined broad policies for the U.S. financial services industry. Furthermore, in 2011, FINRA issued Regulatory Notice 11-44, which contained proposals that, if implemented without modification, may significantly affect the manner in which non-listed REITs, such as NSREIT, raise capital. The proposals contained in Regulatory Notice 11-44 may cause a reduction in capital raised by non-listed REITs, which may cause a negative impact on NSREIT's ability to achieve its business plan, our ability to launch new Sponsored REITs and may further result in a reduction of revenue we are able to earn from our Sponsored REITs. Such intervention has also in certain cases been implemented on an "emergency" basis, suddenly and substantially eliminating market participants' ability to continue to implement certain strategies or manage the risk of their outstanding positions. It is impossible to predict what, if any, additional 49 Table of Contents interim or permanent governmental restrictions may be imposed on the markets and the effect of such restrictions on us and our results of operations. There is a high likelihood of significantly increased regulation of the financial markets that could have an impact on our operating results and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Company Our ability to operate our business successfully would be harmed if key personnel terminate their employment with us. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued services of our key personnel, including our executive officers and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David T. Hamamoto, and our Co-Presidents, Daniel R. Gilbert and Albert Tylis, in particular. For instance, the extent and nature of the experience of our executive officers and nature of the relationships they have developed with real estate developers and financial institutions are critical to the success of our business. Our executive officers have significant real estate investment experience. We cannot assure you of their continued employment with us. The loss of services of certain of our executive officers could harm our business and our prospects. Our board of directors has and will likely in the future adopt certain incentive plans to create incentives that will allow us to retain and attract the services of key employees. These incentive plans may be tied to the performance of our common stock and as a result of the decline in our stock price, we may be unable to motivate and retain our management and these other employees. Our inability to motivate and retain these individuals could also harm our business and our prospects. Additionally, competition for experienced real estate professionals could require us to pay higher wages and provide additional benefits to attract qualified employees, which could result in higher compensation expenses to us. If our ability to issue equity awards to employees is limited, it will require us to award greater cash compensation in relation to previous levels of cash compensation, which will reduce our liquidity and could impact our ability to retain key employees. We have historically paid a substantial portion of our overall compensation in the form of equity awards. Currently, we do not have availability under our incentive plans to issue equity awards to our employees. We will seek stockholder approval for additional equity awards, but in the meantime, we will likely compensate our employees in a greater proportion of cash compared to equity awards. Because adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, excludes equity-based compensation expense, payment of higher levels of cash relative to equity awards will have a negative impact on our AFFO and reduce our liquidity position. Additionally, the lack of availability of equity awards could impact our ability to retain employees as equity awards historically have been a significant component of our long-term incentives. If our risk management systems are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses. We continue to refine our risk management techniques, strategies and assessment methods. However, our risk management techniques and strategies may not fully mitigate the risk exposure of our operations in all economic or market environments, or against all types of risk, including risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate. Any failures in our risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks in our operations or to seek adequate risk-adjusted returns. Refer to Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 50 Table of Contents The use of estimates and valuations may be different from actual results, which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We make various estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Broadly, those estimates are used in measuring the fair value of certain financial instruments, establishing provisions for loan losses and potential litigation liability. Although the credit and equity markets have seen some signs of improvement, continued market volatility makes it extremely difficult to value certain of our real estate securities and CDO bonds payable. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the values of these financial instruments in future periods. In addition, at the time of any sales and settlements of these securities, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than our estimate of their current fair value. Estimates are based on available information and judgment. Therefore, actual values and results could differ from our estimates and that difference could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe AFFO is an appropriate measure of our operating performance; however, in certain instances AFFO may not be reflective of actual economic results. We utilize AFFO as a measure of our operating performance and believe that it is useful to investors because it facilitates an understanding of our operating performance after adjustment for certain non-cash expenses, such as equity-based compensation and unrealized gains (losses) from fair value adjustments. Additionally, we believe that AFFO serves as a good measure of our operating performance because it facilitates evaluation of our Company without the effects of selected items required in accordance U.S. GAAP that may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance and that may not accurately compare our operating performance between periods. Nonetheless, in certain instances AFFO may not necessarily be reflective of our actual economic results. For example, if we purchase CMBS at par but its fair value is reduced in a given year, and then we sell the CMBS in the subsequent year at a price between par and the reduced fair value, we would report a gain for purposes of AFFO as the difference between the year-end fair value and the sales price even though we would have suffered an economic loss. Our book value would, however, accurately reflect the economic loss because the decrease in fair value of the CMBS in the year of purchase would have been recorded as an unrealized loss in our consolidated statement of operations. As a second example, if we repurchase one of our CDO bonds for 50% of par in a given year and its fair value at the end of the prior year was below 50% of par, we would recognize a realized loss on retirement of liabilities for AFFO purposes when we repurchase the CDO bond even though there is a positive economic impact to the retirement of the liability. Consistent with the first example, while our book value would properly reflect the economic benefit from the repurchase of our liability because the decrease in value of the liability would have been recorded as an unrealized gain in the prior year, the impact to AFFO would not be reflective of actual economic results. Accounting for assets acquired subject to CDO financing may not be reflective of actual economic results. U.S. GAAP requires that we record acquired assets and liabilities, including assets and liabilities related to the acquisition of a CDO, at their fair value as of the acquisition date. In July 2010, in connection with the CSE CDO, we were delegated the collateral management and special servicing rights, and acquired the original below-investment grade notes, of a $1.1 billion CRE debt CDO for $7 million. U.S. GAAP requires that we consolidate the assets and liabilities underlying the notes, and treat each asset and outstanding note as separate and distinct from each other. Such assets and liabilities were recorded at their then fair value, which was at a discount to their outstanding principal amounts. Going forward, the acquisition discount on the debt is accreted as non-cash interest income to the estimated recovery value of the debt. 51 Table of Contents We elected the fair value option for the CSE CDO bonds payable assumed, therefore cash interest expense from the liabilities is recorded as interest expense, and interperiod changes in fair value is recorded as unrealized gains (losses). This results in our recognition of cash and non-cash interest income from the debt, and interest expense and unrealized gain (loss) on fair value adjustments of the liabilities in our consolidated statements of operations. This accounting may result in our recognition of net income from the CSE CDO in excess of the actual net interest margin generated, and our AFFO may be different than U.S. GAAP net income (loss) because AFFO excludes unrealized gains (losses) from fair value adjustments. Furthermore, while we may have significant U.S. GAAP net income (loss) and corresponding AFFO as well as operating cash flow, we may not be receiving any cash distributions from our retained interest in our CDO bonds. In addition, the portion of interest income recognized from accretion of the acquisition discount on the debt may never be realized because the principal amount of the CDO bonds payable may ultimately be greater than amounts recovered from the assets. For 2011, we recognized $130 million of interest income ($40 million of contractual cash interest and $90 million of non-cash discount accretion), $6 million of cash interest expense and $42 million of unrealized losses on the change in fair value of securities, derivatives and bonds payable related to the CSE CDO. We may finance assets that we hold on our balance sheet within our CDOs and such financings could expose us to additional risk. We have in the past and may continue to finance assets that we hold on our balance sheet within our CDOs. For example, we financed a $75 million preferred equity position in our healthcare portfolio within one of our CDOs. While we believe such transactions are entered into on market terms, we could be subjected to additional scrutiny because we control both the CDOs and the assets being financed by the CDOs. If it was ever determined that we did not satisfy our obligations to a CDO in connection with such a financing, we could be subject to damages and costs that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. AFFO includes realized gains (losses) on items such as extinguishment of liabilities and sales of CRE securities, which we may not be able to replicate in the future. For purposes of AFFO, we include realized gains (losses) from extinguishing our debt and CDO bonds and from the sales of CRE securities. Replicating these gains may not be possible, which could significantly impact our AFFO in the future. If we are unable to generate substantial gains in order to increase our AFFO, our stock price could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on us. U.S. GAAP requirements and our fair value adjustments of our liabilities do not necessarily provide a precise economic reflection of our stockholders' equity. We have elected the fair value option for almost all of our CDO bonds payable, but we do not fair value the corresponding debt, which we hold at principal amount net of any related provisions for losses. Even if these loans are performing, because of a number of factors, including credit spread widening and concerns over CRE generally, a third-party may not be willing to pay par for such loans. Therefore, our carrying value for these loans is likely above their current economic value. Additionally, while we have liabilities that are valued below the principal amount that we owe on such liabilities, which correspondingly increases our stockholders' equity, absent repurchasing such liabilities at a discount we will be required to repay the full par amount of such liabilities at maturity or upon a liquidation of the underlying collateral or our Company. As a result of the foregoing, our stockholders' equity is not necessarily reflective of current economic or liquidation value. 52 Table of Contents While we believe adjusted book value is a useful measure to report, it is subject to significant judgment and may not be reflective of actual economic value. We have and may continue to report adjusted book value in our earnings releases and elsewhere, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe adjusted book value is a useful measure to report to investors because it adjusts for certain unrealized adjustments, loan loss reserves and accumulated depreciation and amortization that may not necessarily be indicative of our actual economic book value. The adjustments, however, may not provide investors with a meaningful measure by which to evaluate our economic book value. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on it. Our dividend policy is subject to change. On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including REIT qualification requirements, the amount of cash flows provided by operating activities, availability of existing cash balances, borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, our view of our ability to realize gains in the future through appreciation in the value of our assets, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to further adjustment based upon any one or more of the risk factors set forth in this Form 10-K, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend. We may not be able to make distributions in the future. Our ability to generate income and to make distributions may be adversely affected by the risks described in this Form 10-K and any document we file with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable law, and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our REIT qualification and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time-to-time. We may not be able to make distributions in the future. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by the requirements of Maryland law. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by the laws of Maryland. Under applicable Maryland law, a Maryland corporation may not make a distribution if, after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation would not be able to pay its liabilities as the liabilities become due in the usual course of business, or generally if the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if the corporation were dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. Accordingly, we may not make a distribution on our common stock if, after giving effect to the distribution, we would not be able to pay our liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business or generally if our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock then outstanding, if any, with preferences senior to those of our common stock. We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business. As a CRE finance company, our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems, including systems provided by third parties for which we have no control. Any failure or interruption of our systems, whether as a result of human error or otherwise, could cause delays or 53 Table of Contents other problems in our activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Our platform may not be as scalable as we anticipate and we could face difficulties growing our business without significant new investment in our infrastructure. While we believe our platform for operating our lines of business is highly scalable and can support significant growth without substantial new investment in our infrastructure, we may be wrong in that assessment. It is possible that if our business grows substantially, we will need to make significant new investment in our infrastructure to support that growth. We may be unable to make significant investments in our infrastructure on a timely basis or at reasonable costs and our failure in this regard could disrupt our business and operations. We may not be effective originating and managing our debt investments. We originate and generally manage our debt investments. Our origination capabilities depend on our ability to leverage our relationships in the market and deploy capital to borrowers that hold properties meeting our underwriting standards. Managing these debt investments requires significant resources, adherence to internal policies and attention to detail. Managing and special servicing may also require significant judgment and, despite our expectations, we may make decisions that result in losses. If we are unable to successfully originate debt investments on favorable terms, or at all, and if we are ineffective in managing those investments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We may determine to grow our business through acquisitions of assets or other companies which entails substantial risk. We may determine to grow our business through the acquisition of assets, including CDO or other companies. Such acquisitions entail substantial risk. During our due diligence of such acquisitions, we may not uncover all relevant liabilities and we may have limited, if any, recourse against the sellers. Further, we may not successfully integrate the assets or company that we acquire into our business and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition. Maintenance of our Investment Company Act exemption imposes limits on our operations. We conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines as an investment company any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer's total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term "investment securities," among other things, are securities issued by majority owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Because we are a holding company that conducts its businesses through subsidiaries, the securities issued by our subsidiaries that rely on the exception from the definition of "investment company" in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own directly, may not have a combined value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis. This requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage through these subsidiaries. We believe that neither our operating partnership nor our majority-owned private REIT subsidiary through which we hold the substantial majority of our investments are investment companies because 54 Table of Contents each of them satisfy the 40% test of Section 3(a)(1)(C). We must monitor their holdings to ensure that the value of their investment securities does not exceed 40% of their respective total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Certain of our other subsidiaries do not satisfy the 40% test, but instead rely on exceptions and exemptions from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act that either limits the types of assets these subsidiaries may purchase or the manner in which these subsidiaries may acquire and sell assets. For instance, certain of our CDOs rely on the exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act provided by Rule 3a-7 thereunder, which is available for certain structured financing vehicles. This exemption limits the ability of these CDOs to sell their assets and reinvest the proceeds from asset sales. Our subsidiary that invests in net lease properties relies on the exception from the definition of "investment company" provided by Sections 3(c)(6) and 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, and certain of our other CDOs similarly rely on the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exception from the definition of "investment company." These provisions exempt companies that primarily invest in real estate, mortgages and certain other qualifying real estate assets. When a CDO relies on the exception from the definition of "investment company" provided by 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, the CDO is limited in the types of real estate related assets that it could invest in. Our subsidiaries that engage in operating businesses and satisfy the 40% test are also not subject to the Investment Company Act. The loss of our Investment Company Act exemption could require us to register as an investment company or substantially change the way we conduct our business, either of which may have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our common stock. On August 31, 2011, the SEC published a concept release (Release No. 29778, File No. S7-34-11, Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and Mortgage Related Instruments), pursuant to which it is reviewing whether certain companies that invest in mortgage-backed securities and rely on the exemption from registration under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, such as us, should continue to be allowed to rely on such an exemption from registration. If the SEC takes action with respect to this exemption, these changes could mean that certain of our CDOs and other subsidiaries could no longer rely on the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exemption, and would have to rely on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7), which would mean that our investment in those subsidiaries would be investment securities. This could result in our failure to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company. If we fail to maintain an exemption, exception or other exclusion from registration as an investment company, either because of SEC interpretational changes or otherwise, we could, among other things, be required either: (a) to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company; or (b) to register as an investment company, either of which could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our common stock. If we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters. Issuances of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Stock Purchase Plan more than three years after the related registration statement became effective may give rise to a right of rescission. Certain issuances of shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Stock Purchase Plan, or DRPSPP, occurred more than three years after the related registration statement for those plans became effective. As a result, certain investors may have a rescission right. If a rescission right exists with respect to the issuances under our DRPSPP, it would apply to up to 55 Table of Contents 127,500 shares of our common stock issued for aggregate consideration of up to $513,500. In addition, the staff of the SEC has taken the position that an investor's right of rescission may survive a rescission offer. Maryland takeover statutes may prevent a change of our control. This could depress our stock price. Under Maryland law, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board. After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation; and two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer, including potential acquisitions that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has exempted any business combinations: (i) between us and NorthStar Capital Investment Corp. or any of its affiliates; and (ii) between us and any person, provided that any such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of our directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person). Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements do not apply to business combinations between us and any of them. As a result, such parties may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and the other provisions in the statute. Our authorized but unissued common and preferred stock and other provisions of our charter and bylaws may prevent a change in our control. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and authorizes our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend our charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have the authority to issue. In addition, our board of directors may 56 Table of Contents classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could establish a series of common stock or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Maryland law also allows a corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three independent directors to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in its charter or bylaws, to a classified board, unless its charter prohibits such an election. Our charter contains a provision prohibiting such an election to classify our board under this provision of Maryland law. This may make us more vulnerable to a change in control. If our stockholders voted to amend this charter provision and to classify our board of directors, the staggered terms of our directors could reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt at a change in control even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interests of our stockholders. Risks Related to Our REIT Tax Status Our failure to qualify as a REIT would subject us to federal income tax and reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We intend to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial and administrative interpretations exist. Even an inadvertent or technical mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Our continued qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Moreover, new tax legislation, administrative guidance or court decisions, in each instance potentially with retroactive effect, could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and distributions to stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of, and trading prices for, our stock. We hold substantially all of our assets in a majority-owned subsidiary, which we refer to as our private REIT. Our private REIT is organized to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Additionally, we have sponsored and manage, through our private REIT, additional entities that qualify or intend to qualify as REITs. Our private REIT and any REITs we sponsor and manage must also meet all of the REIT qualification tests under the Internal Revenue Code and are subject to all of the same risks as us. If our private REIT did not qualify as a REIT, it is likely that we would also not qualify as a REIT. If, for any reason, we failed to qualify as a REIT and we were not entitled to relief under certain Internal Revenue Code provisions, we would be unable to elect REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to so qualify. 57 Table of Contents Complying with REIT requirements may force us to borrow funds to make distributions to stockholders or otherwise depend on external sources of capital to fund such distributions. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. To the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net long-term capital gain. In that case, a stockholder would be taxed on its proportionate share of our undistributed long-term gain and would receive a credit or refund for its proportionate share of the tax we paid. A stockholder, including a tax-exempt or foreign stockholder, would have to file a federal income tax return to claim that credit or refund. Furthermore, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws. We anticipate that distributions generally will be taxable as ordinary income, although a portion of such distributions may be designated by us as long-term capital gain to the extent attributable to capital gain income recognized by us, or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that such distribution exceeds our earnings and profits as determined for tax purposes. From time-to-time, we may generate taxable income greater than our net income for U.S. GAAP, among other things, amortization of capitalized purchase premiums, fair value adjustments and reserves. In addition, our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders as a result of, among other things, repurchases of our outstanding debt at a discount and investments in assets that generate taxable income in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets (for example, if a borrower defers the payment of interest in cash pursuant to a contractual right or otherwise). We believe that our operating partnership properly elected to defer, under section 108(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, the recognition of cancellation of indebtedness, or COD, income generated from repurchasing its debt at a discount. If the IRS successfully challenges our operating partnership's ability to make that election, we may be treated as having failed to pay sufficient dividends to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and/or avoid the corporate income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax. We may be required to correct any failure to meet the 90% distribution requirement by paying deficiency dividends to our stockholders and an interest charge to the IRS in a later year. If we do not have other funds available in the situations described in the preceding paragraphs, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell investments at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds to make distributions sufficient to enable us to distribute enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Because of the distribution requirement, it is unlikely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection with investments, from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund future capital needs, we likely will have to rely on third-party sources of capital, including both debt and equity financing, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our stock. We could fail to qualify as a REIT if the IRS successfully challenges our treatment of our mezzanine loans and repurchase agreements. We intend to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. However, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex 58 Table of Contents Internal Revenue Code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial and administrative interpretations exist. If the IRS disagrees with the application of these provisions to our assets or transactions, including assets we have owned and past transactions, our REIT qualification could be jeopardized. For example, IRS Revenue Procedure 2003-65 provides a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan, if it meets each of the requirements contained in Revenue Procedure 2003-65, will be treated by the IRS as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and interest derived from it will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the REIT 75% income test. Although Revenue Procedure 2003-65 provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law. Moreover, our mezzanine loans typically do not meet all of the requirements for reliance on this safe harbor. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in mezzanine loans in a manner that we believe will enable us to continue to satisfy the REIT gross income and asset tests. In addition, we have entered into sale and repurchase agreements under which we nominally sold certain of our mortgage assets to a counterparty and simultaneously entered into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets. We believe that we will be treated for federal income tax purposes as the owner of the mortgage assets that are the subject of any such sale and repurchase agreement notwithstanding that we transferred record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the mortgage assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case our ability to qualify as a REIT could be adversely affected. Even if the IRS were to disagree with one or more of our interpretations and we were treated as having failed to satisfy one of the REIT qualification requirements, we could maintain our REIT qualification if our failure was excused under certain statutory savings provisions. However, there can be no guarantee that we would be entitled to benefit from those statutory savings provisions if we failed to satisfy one of the REIT qualification requirements, and even if we were entitled to benefit from those statutory savings provisions, we could be required to pay a penalty tax. Even if we remain qualified as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from certain activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, the federal alternative minimum tax and state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, in order to meet the REIT qualification requirements, or to avert the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from dealer property or inventory, we may hold some of our assets through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs. Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments. To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. As discussed above, we may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Additionally, we may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise attractive to us in order to satisfy the source of income requirements for qualifying as a REIT. We must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more 59 Table of Contents than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets), and no more than 25% of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences, unless certain relief provisions apply. As a result, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of profit maximization and may require us to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. Modifications of the terms of our real estate debt investments and the mortgage loans underlying our CMBS in conjunction with reductions in the value of the real property securing such loans could cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Our CRE debt and CMBS investments have been and may continue to be materially affected by the weakened condition of the real estate market and the economy in general. As a result, many of the terms of our real estate debt and the loans supporting our CMBS have been modified to avoid foreclosure actions and for other reasons. Under the Internal Revenue Code, if the terms of a loan are modified in a manner constituting a "significant modification," such modification triggers a deemed exchange of the original loan for the modified loan. In general, under applicable Treasury Regulations, or the Loan-to-Value Regulation, if a loan is secured by real property and other property and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan determined as of the date we agreed to acquire the loan or the date we significantly modified the loan, a portion of the interest income from such loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, but will be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. Although the law is not entirely clear, a portion of the loan will likely be a non-qualifying asset for purposes of the 75% asset test. The non-qualifying portion of such a loan would be subject to, among other requirements, the requirement that a REIT not hold securities possessing more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer, or the 10% Value Test. IRS Revenue Procedure 2011-16 provides a safe harbor pursuant to which we will not be required to redetermine the fair market value of the real property securing a loan for purposes of the gross income and asset tests discussed above in connection with a loan modification that is: (1) occasioned by a borrower default; or (2) made at a time when we reasonably believe that the modification to the loan will substantially reduce a significant risk of default on the original loan. No assurance can be provided that all of our loan modifications have or will qualify for the safe harbor in Revenue Procedure 2011-16. To the extent we significantly modify loans in a manner that does not qualify for that safe harbor, we will be required to redetermine the value of the real property securing the loan at the time it was significantly modified. In determining the value of the real property securing such a loan, we generally will not obtain third-party appraisals, but rather will rely on internal valuations. No assurance can be provided that the IRS will not successfully challenge our internal valuations. If the terms of our mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and B-Notes and loans supporting our mortgage backed securities are "significantly modified" in a manner that does not qualify for the safe harbor in Revenue Procedure 2011-16 and the fair market value of the real property securing such loans has decreased significantly, we could fail the 75% gross income test, the 75% asset test and/or the 10% Value Test. Unless we qualified for relief under certain Internal Revenue Code cure provisions, such failures could cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. 60 Table of Contents Our ability to invest in distressed debt may be limited by our intention to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We have and may in the future acquire distressed debt, including distressed first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage interests, mezzanine loans and CMBS. In general, under the Loan-to-Value Regulation, if a loan is secured by real property and other property and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to acquire the loan or the date we significantly modified the loan, a portion of the interest income from such a loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, but will be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. Although the law is not entirely clear, a portion of the loan will also likely be a non-qualifying asset for purposes of the 75% asset test. The non-qualifying portion of such a loan would be subject to, among other requirements, the 10% Value Test. IRS Revenue Procedure 2011-16 provides a safe harbor under which the IRS has stated that it will not challenge a REIT's treatment of a loan as being, in part, a qualifying real estate asset in an amount equal to the lesser of: (1) the fair market value of the real property securing the loan determined as of the date the REIT committed to originate or acquire the loan; or (2) the fair market value of the loan on the date of the relevant quarterly REIT asset testing date. This safe harbor will help us comply with the REIT asset tests immediately following the acquisition of distressed debt. It will be less helpful as the value of the distressed debt increases. Under the safe harbor, when the value of a distressed debt exceeds the fair market value of the real property that secures the debt, determined as of the date we committed to acquire the debt, the excess will be treated as non-qualifying asset. Accordingly, an increasing portion of a distressed debt will be treated as a non-qualifying asset as the value of the distressed debt increases. Additionally, Revenue Procedure 2011-16 states that the IRS will treat a distressed debt as producing a significant amount of non-qualifying income for the 75% gross income test. Specifically, Revenue Procedure 2011-16 indicates that interest income on distressed debt will be treated as qualifying income based on the ratio of (1) fair market value of the real property securing the debt determined as of the date we committed to acquire the debt and (2) the face amount of the debt (and not the purchase price of the debt). The face amount of a distressed debt will typically exceed the fair market value of the real property securing the debt on the date we commit to acquire the debt. Because distressed debt may produce a significant amount of non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and a significant portion of a distressed debt may be treated as a non-qualifying asset for the REIT asset tests once the debt increases in value, we may be limited in our ability to invest in distressed debt and maintain our qualification as a REIT. Our investments in distressed debt may produce "phantom income" that will increase the amount of taxable income we have to distribute to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and may cause us to sell assets, borrow or make taxable distributions of debt or equity securities to satisfy that requirement. Our acquisition of distressed debt may cause us to recognize "phantom income" (or non-cash income) for federal income tax purposes. For example, if we acquire non-publicly traded distressed debt and then significantly modify that debt, we would recognize gain on the resulting deemed exchange equal to the difference between the adjusted issue price of the distressed debt and our adjusted tax basis in the distressed debt. Because we typically acquire distressed debt at a significant discount, our adjusted tax basis in the distressed debt typically is significantly lower than the adjusted issue price of the distressed debt. Accordingly, if we significantly modify non-publicly traded distressed debt, we may recognize a substantial amount of taxable income without receiving any cash. That "phantom income" will increase the amount of taxable income we are required to distribute to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement. To satisfy that requirement, we may have sell assets or borrow funds at inopportune times or make taxable distributions of our debt or equity securities. 61 Table of Contents Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively. The REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to hedge our operations effectively. Our aggregate gross income from non-qualifying hedges, fees and certain other non-qualifying sources cannot exceed 5% of our annual gross income. Additionally, our gross income from qualifying hedges entered into prior to July 31, 2008 constitutes non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Consequently, our gross income from qualifying hedges entered into prior to July 31, 2008, along with other sources of non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, cannot exceed 25% of our annual gross income. As a result, we might have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through TRS. Any hedging income earned by a TRS would be subject to federal, state and local income tax at regular corporate rates. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities or expose us to greater risks associated interest rate or other changes than we would otherwise incur. We may fail to qualify as a REIT as a result of our fee income from managing certain structured finance and investment vehicles and our income from active businesses. We currently manage certain structured finance and investment vehicles that are treated as TRSs or REITs. Fee income and active business income that we generate directly (rather than through a TRS) constitute non-qualifying income for purposes of the 95% and 75% gross income tests. It is not possible to predict with complete accuracy the amount of gross income that we will generate in any taxable year due to, among other things, fluctuations in interest rates. Accordingly, our qualifying income for purposes of our gross income tests may be lower than we anticipate, and, conversely, our fee income and active business income may be higher than we anticipate. If our fee income and active business income, combined with other sources of non-qualifying income, such as income from non-qualifying hedges, exceed 5% of our gross income, we would fail to satisfy the 95% gross income test. Unless we qualified for certain Internal Revenue Code cure provisions, a failure of the 95% gross income test would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Liquidation of assets may jeopardize our REIT status. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate our mortgage, preferred equity or other investments to satisfy our obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our status as a REIT. Adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce the market price of our common stock. At any time, the federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. Any of those new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect us or you as a stockholder. For example, legislation enacted in 2003, 2006 and 2010 generally reduced the federal income tax rate on most dividends paid by corporations to investors taxed at individual rates to a maximum of 15% through the end of 2012. REIT dividends, with limited exceptions, do not benefit from the rate reduction, because a REITs income is generally not subject to corporate level tax. As such, this legislation could cause shares in non-REIT corporations to be a more attractive investment to investors taxed at individual rates than shares in REITs and could have an adverse effect on the value of our stock. The prohibited transactions tax may limit our ability to engage in transactions, including dispositions of assets and certain methods of securitizing loans, that would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. A REIT's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including 62 Table of Contents loans, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. If we securitize loans in a manner that is, for federal income tax purposes, treated as a sale of the loans we may be subject to the prohibited transaction tax. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions even though such sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us. Additionally, we may be subject to the prohibited transaction tax upon a disposition of real property. Although a safe-harbor to the characterization of the sale of real property by a REIT as a prohibited transaction is available, we cannot assure you that we can comply with the safe harbor or that we will avoid owning property that may be characterized as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Consequently, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of real property or may conduct such sales through a TRS. We may recognize substantial amounts of REIT taxable income, which we would be required to distribute to our stockholders, in a year in which we are not profitable under GAAP principles or other economic measures. We may recognize substantial amounts of REIT taxable income in years in which we are not profitable under U.S. GAAP or other economic measures as a result of the differences between U.S. GAAP and tax accounting methods. For example, we may recognize substantial amounts of COD income for federal income tax purposes (but not for U.S. GAAP purposes) due to discount repurchases of our debt, which could cause our REIT taxable income to exceed our U.S. GAAP income. Additionally, we may deduct our capital losses only to the extent of our capital gains and not against our ordinary income, in computing our REIT taxable income for a given taxable year. Finally, certain of our assets and liabilities are marked-to-market for U.S. GAAP purposes but not for tax purposes, which could result in losses for U.S. GAAP purposes that are not recognized in computing our REIT taxable income. Consequently, we could recognize substantial amounts of REIT taxable income, and would be required to distribute such income to our stockholders, in a year in which we are not profitable under U.S. GAAP or other economic measures. We may distribute our common stock in a taxable dividend, in which case stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such dividends, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. We may make taxable dividends that are payable in cash and common stock. The IRS has issued private letter rulings to other REITs treating certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock as taxable dividends that would satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for federal income tax purposes. Those rulings may be relied upon only by taxpayers to whom they were issued, but we could request a similar ruling from the IRS. In addition, the IRS previously issued a revenue procedure authorizing publicly traded REITs to make elective cash/stock dividends, but that revenue procedure does not apply to our 2012 and future taxable years. Accordingly, it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to make taxable dividends payable in cash and common stock. If made a taxable dividend payable in cash and common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount recorded in earnings with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and our common stock and a significant number of our stockholders 63 Table of Contents determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. We may lose our REIT status if the IRS successfully challenges our characterization of our income from our foreign taxable REIT subsidiaries. We have elected to treat several Cayman Islands companies, including issuers in CDO transactions, as TRSs. We will likely be required to include in our income, even without the receipt of actual distributions, earnings from our investment in the foreign TRSs. Income inclusions from equity investments in foreign corporations are technically neither actual dividends nor any of the other enumerated categories of qualifying income for the 95% gross income test. However, the IRS has issued private letter rulings to other REITs holding that income inclusions from equity investments in foreign corporations would be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. Private letter rulings may be relied upon only by the taxpayers to whom they are issued and the IRS may revoke a private letter ruling. Based on those private letter rulings and advice of counsel, we intend to treat such income inclusions as qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. Nevertheless, no assurance can be provided that the IRS would not successfully challenge our treatment of such income as qualifying income. In the event that such income was determined not to qualify for the 95% gross income test, we could be subject to a penalty tax with respect to such income to the extent it exceeds 5% of our gross income or we could fail to qualify as a REIT. If our foreign taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level, it would greatly reduce the amounts those entities would have available to distribute to us and that they would have available to pay their creditors. There is a specific exemption from federal income tax for non-U.S. corporations that restrict their activities in the U.S. to trading stock and securities (or any activity closely related thereto) for their own account whether such trading (or such other activity) is conducted by the corporation or its employees through a resident broker, commission agent, custodian or other agent. We intend that our foreign TRSs will rely on that exemption or otherwise operate in a manner so that they will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their net income at the entity level. If the IRS succeeded in challenging that tax treatment, it would greatly reduce the amount that those foreign TRSs would have available to pay to their creditors and to distribute to us. The stock ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code for REITs and the 9.8% stock ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and restrict our business combination opportunities. To qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding stock at any time during the last half of a taxable year. Attribution rules in the Internal Revenue Code determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our stock under this requirement. Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year. To help insure that we meet these tests, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of shares of our stock. Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person, including entities, may own more than 9.8% of the value of our outstanding shares of stock or more than 9.8% in value or number (whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. The board may not grant an exemption from these restrictions to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of 9.8% of the value of our outstanding shares would result in the termination of our status as a REIT. Despite these restrictions, it is possible that there will be five or fewer individuals who own more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares, which could cause us to 64 Table of Contents fail to qualify as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders. Our dividends that are attributable to excess inclusion income will likely increase the tax liability of our tax-exempt stockholders, foreign stockholders and stockholders with net operating losses. In general, dividend income that a tax-exempt entity receives from us should not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in Section 512 of the Internal Revenue Code. If we realize excess inclusion income and allocate it to our stockholders, however, then this income would be fully taxable as unrelated business taxable income to a tax-exempt entity under Section 512 of the Internal Revenue Code. A foreign stockholder would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax withholding on this income without reduction pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty. U.S. stockholders would not be able to offset such income with their net operating losses. Although the law is not entirely clear, the IRS has taken the position that we are subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on the portion of our excess inclusion income equal to the percentage of our stock held in record name by "disqualified organizations" (generally tax-exempt investors, such as certain state pension plans and charitable remainder trusts, that are not subject to the tax on unrelated business taxable income). To the extent that our stock owned by "disqualified organizations" is held in street name by a broker-dealer or other nominee, the broker-dealer or nominee would be liable for a tax at the highest corporate rate on the portion of our excess inclusion income allocable to the stock held on behalf of the "disqualified organizations." A regulated investment company or other pass-through entity owning our stock may also be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rate on any excess inclusion income allocated to their record name owners that are "disqualified organizations." Excess inclusion income could result if a REIT held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit, or REMIC. In addition, excess inclusion income also may be generated if a REIT issues liabilities with two or more maturities and the terms of the payments of these liabilities bear a relationship to the payments that the REIT received on mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities securing those liabilities. Although we do not hold any REMIC residual interests, we anticipate that certain of the term financings conducted by our private REIT will produce excess inclusion income that will be allocated to our stockholders. Accordingly, we expect that a portion of our dividends may constitute excess inclusion income, which will likely increase the tax liability of tax-exempt stockholders, foreign stockholders, stockholders with net operating losses, regulated investment companies and other pass-through entities whose record name owners are disqualified organizations and brokers-dealers and other nominees who hold stock on behalf of disqualified organizations.
